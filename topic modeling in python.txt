topic modeling:

it answers what text is all about
uncovers underlying semantic structure of text

lda(latent dirichlet allocation) is simplest topic model and is a generative model. it mimics writing process. that means it generates the document given writing topics.

topic chains is used to uncover underlying semantic structure of sequential corpus of news. it shows how a news evolved or changed in time and how long each news or topic lasted long. it means it captures topic evolution over time

to construct topic chains:
1.divide articles into time slices of 10 days each
2. find topics for each time using lda
3. look for similar topics within neighboring time slices
4. connect similar to form topic chains
5.identify long term general topics(h1b1 issue)
6. identify short term temporal issues(death of a person)
7. analyze how topics change over time

topic is multinominal distribution over words--kl divergence
topic is a vector where each dimension is a probability of word in the topic--cosine similarity
topic is a ranked list of words--kendall's dcg
topic is a set of top probability words

asum: aspect sentiment unification model is to uncover structure of aspects and sentiments in a review
amazon does aspect or attribute based sentiment analysis

topic modeling applications:
recommendation engine has moved to collaborative filtering to collaborative topic modeling

it is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstarct topics that occur in a collection of documents

exploratory:discover,browse,search,unlabeled
latent variables:hidden thematic structure,abstract topics
clustering:cluster of words,document collection

k- no of topics
m- no of documents
n- no of words in each document
psi-frequency of words in each topic
phi-distribution of topic in each document
alpha,beta--hyperparameters

topic modeling comes under unsupervised learning. as unsupervised learning has a disadvantage of not having training dataset
