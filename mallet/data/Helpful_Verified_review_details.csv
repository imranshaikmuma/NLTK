DSLR Cameras,B00IB1BTWI,Canon EOS Rebel T5 Digital SLR Camera…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Came right on time!  July 29  2016By real review!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I ordered this one because it was cheaper than getting it brand new. I purchased the option for express shipping ($14) and it said it was going to come on Monday because I ordered it on a Thursday(the 28th). It came the very next day! I was a little worried that it wasn't going to look brand new but I was wrong. Everything was wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap so nothing got damaged. It looked as if I paid for a brand new one. All of the items were there and I immediately put it together and turned it on. No problems at all that I can see at the moment. The only thing I don't like is the strap. It doesn't seem like it'll last long so I'll just buy a better thicker one. But overall  Im happy about this purchase! Now all I have to do is buy extra batteries more cards a better strap and a durable bag.,0

April 11  2016By Amanda Ruth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a really great camera for beginner photographers and families. It's simple to operate with auto focus and it's great for capturing moments at your kids soccer game or whatever. Student photographers would also love this camera. It helps you learn the basics of DSLR cameras without completely breaking the bank. Love it.,1

DSLR Cameras,B00IB1BTWI,Canon EOS Rebel T5 Digital SLR Camera…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Excellent camera kit for a beginner or advanced amateur's first  DSLR  July 4  2015By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is the lowest cost DSLR camera Canon makes their entry level DSLR.  It was released in 2014.  It has an optical viewfinder for pictures but not video.  The 3"" LCD panel on the back affixed to the camera is used for video and can be used for pictures.  The optical viewfinder is blocked when the LCD panel is used because the mirror is lifted. This kit from Canon comes with both a18-55 mm and a 75-300 mm auto focus Canon lens plus a case.  These lenses provide the equivalent range of 29 mm to 480 mm with the APS-C image sensor providing a 0.6 wide angle to 9.6 telephoto range.  The 18x55 lens has image stability (IS) built in.  The camera can be used like a point and shoot camera or used in a totally manual/professional  mode with all settings controlled by the user.  The 18 Mpixel  APS image sensor provides very high quality pictures and full 1080 video.  I am very pleased with the camera kit.  I have only had this camera for two months but used a Canon AE1 film SLR for many years.",0

I love the fact that it can be used it auto mode or manual. I use the manual mode while my wife likes the auto. Picture quality is fantastic and because of the high resulution enlargements retain the clarity. I have received compliments on some of the pictures the short time I have had it. Great camera for the budding photographer or someone whose hobby is taking pictures and does not want to spend alot of money.,1

DSLR Cameras,B00IB1BTWI,Canon EOS Rebel T5 Digital SLR Camera…,        24 of 27 people found the following review helpful       Great first DSLR  May 28  2015By Grant,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great starter DSLR.  This is my first camera that is not a point-and-shoot and it's great especially for the price.  The lens that comes with it is also pretty darn good.  The automatic settings do a really good job of picking shutter speeds f stops and white balances for great photos.  I also really like the aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings.  The shutter speed priority setting is especially useful for taking photos when motion is an issue such as from a moving vehicle.  lso there is a great feature in some modes that allows you to set 3 exposure levels and take 3 photos at different exposures.  Doing this is not very intuitive though and takes some manual reading.I do wish that this camera could take photos in aspect ratios other than 3:2 but that's all it can do.  There is no panorama setting either.Overall a very good camera as a first DSLR.  A huge upgrade from point and shoot.,0
DSLR Cameras,B00IB1BTWI,Canon EOS Rebel T5 Digital SLR Camera…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       I loved my Canon Rebel XSi of years ago as well  September 2  2015By Magickal*Madness,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had Canon digital SLRs since the 20D and have been using them personally and professionally for 10 years.  I loved my Canon Rebel XSi of years ago as well.  I really haven't had a Canon dSLR that I haven't loved!  I purchased the T5 for my daughter to use who has to take photography as a restricted elective for her graphic design degree.  I didn't feel generous enough to share my 70D!  :)  The price of the T5 is right but after re-visiting the specs we've decided to exchange it for a T5i since it's likely going to become my back-up camera and I realized the T5 doesn't have spot-metering and the ISO tops out at 6000-ish.  I'm still a Canon fan though!  I think for most beginners the extra $250 for the T5i would be a waste...I'm just an old pro and very picky.,0

DSLR Cameras,B01KITZRBE,Nikon D3400 DSLR Camera with AF-P DX…,        34 of 38 people found the following review helpful       Amazing value for the money  December 30  2016By John H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The Nikon D3400 with the new 18-55mm and 70-300mm AF-P lenses cannot be beat at the current price ($500). The D3400 camera body and compact and light for a DSLR. The 18-55mm lens is what you would expect from a kit lens and has VR (vibration reduction the Nikon version of image stabilization). The 70-300mm is great for when you need more reach and is fast focusing. Nikon sells a VR version of the 70-300mm lens however they included a non-VR version in this package. That is disappointing as the image stabilization would be helpful at longer zooms at slower shutter speeds. I plan to use this lens primarily for outdoor sports with faster shutter speeds so it won't make much of a difference for me but it would be nice to have the VR for indoor or low light outdoor situations. Also Nikon has added software to this camera so it will not function with 3rd party batteries installed. I learned this the hard way and will be sending back the 3rd party batteries I purchased. However I've been told that there are new 3rd party batteries that have found  a way around this. I'm waiting for mine to arrive to confirm this.I've attached some sample images I took from both lenses on the D3400 from a trip to the zoo's Festival of Lights. I used the 70-300mm for most of the outdoor animals while the sun was up then switched to the 18-55mm for indoor animals and to take pictures of the lights (using a monopod) once the sun went down.,1
DSLR Cameras,B01KITZRBE,Nikon D3400 DSLR Camera with AF-P DX…,        230 of 266 people found the following review helpful       Great Camera  September 17  2016By Alex,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A Bit of Background:I upgraded to the D3400 after the auto-focus on my D3300 died and getting my old refurb repaired was likely to cost half of what the new one would. I loved my D3300 as a beginner's camera. I wanted to develop my photography skills and be able to take a shot at astrophotography without spending too much. For these purposes it worked really well but when it started to malfunction I knew I still wasn't ready for something with more settings I probably wouldn't use.This Camera:  This camera is very similar to its predecessor which in my opinion is good if you liked your D3300.  The only real differences I have detected as of yet are as follows (I will update these as I use the camera more):Bluetooth:  I really like the Bluetooth. Being able to post my photos to Flickr or Facebook because the camera sends them directly to my phone is pretty satisfying. I read some complaints about the app SnapBridge but have not run into any issues myself yet and had no trouble pairing my devices.Different ports to connect to PC:  UPDATE I do not know what the exact difference in ports is but they are different than the ports on the D3300 and the micro USB cord I used to use to connect my camera to my PC is no longer compatible. (I posted photos of the difference between the ports on the two cameras. The D3400 is the shiny red one.}  Not only are the ports different but the camera did not come with any cables that would allow me to connect it to my PC. Also something of note and this is part of why I gave the D3400 4 stars instead of 5 is that while the camera does come with a battery charger it does NOT come with a battery or a memory card. Luckily for me the battery from my D3300 was compatible. If I had ordered this camera without having owned my D3300 previously I would have been really annoyed at the absence of these.Image Quality:The D3400 does not disappoint when it comes to image quality. If you are upgrading from the D3300 you can expect the same beautiful image quality as you had before. The attached photos were taken with the 18-55mm lens that comes with this package. I love the lens as an all purpose default lens to have on my camera. It can zoom up really well for great detail which are my favorite shots.In Short:This camera is great and doesn't disappoint aside from the lack of peripherals that are really required for getting going taking photos. Not coming with a battery memory card and necessary cables really rubs me the wrong way especially considering how much we are paying for the camera.I will likely update this as I play more with this little beauty. If you want something similar to your D3300 but are not expecting a lot of upgraded bells and whistles this is the camera for you. If you are coming from no camera or a different one altogether I still recommend the D3400 for beginners or casual photographers that want good image quality especially in low light conditions at a reasonable price. Just remember to order your peripherals as all you get in this package is the lens the strap and a charging port.,1

DSLR Cameras,B01KITZRBE,Nikon D3400 DSLR Camera with AF-P DX…,        15 of 18 people found the following review helpful       and the poor Snapbridge reviews pre-date the iOS update  February 12  2017By Sebastian Chaskel,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,While this camera has a 4.5 rating right now on Amazon potential buyers should know: in order to use Bluetooth to transfer photos to your phone or tablet Nikon does not allow you to use third-party apps. You need to use the Nikon app Snapbridge which currently has 1.5 stars with 279 reviews on the Apple App Store. The main issue is the camera simply does not pair to devices. Nikon Support has an article which says they're having trouble with the new Apple iOS but this article is over a month old and the poor Snapbridge reviews pre-date the iOS update. I bought the camera based on the high Amazon reviews and now wish I had made an informed decision considering Snapbridge's poor performance which is why I am posting this for other potential buyers to see.,0

The Nikon had a learning curve but the quality of photo it produces is worth it. Pulling photos off the camera was a struggle as Nikon has a dedicated FINE format but shooting in JPEG solves that. All in all I'm happy with the camera for the price.,1
DSLR Cameras,B01CO2JPYS,Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera…,        106 of 119 people found the following review helpful       Awesome camera for someone new to photography  July 4  2016By Run Fanatic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am brand spanking new to photography and DSLR cameras. Thanks to a few hours at the University of YouTube I think I have the hang of it. So my review is partial but from the perspective of a total novice to photography and something other than a point and shoot camera.Feature guideI'm putting this first as this may be the most amazing and useful component of this camera for a complete newbie and the #1 reason this is an AWESOME camera for someone getting into photography. Since I didn't want to use my camera on auto mode (I could stick with a Coolpix if that's what I was looking for) and my goal was to learn how to use a DSLR in manual mode the feature guide has been vital in helping me learn quickly. When changing modes (manual aperture priority Quick Control etc) a brief description of the mode will pop up on the LCD. This is SUPER useful for a complete novice that has nearly ZERO knowledge (Thank You YouTube!) of what the different modes/controls are supposed to do. Seriously - best.feature.ever! For those that already know all of this like the back of their hand (I deeply admire you!) you can turn this feature off so it doesn't annoy you.Camera bodyThis is a heavy piece of equipment compared to the slim simple point and shoot cameras (read: Nikon Coolpix). However it is fairly comfortable to hold. The body has a nice curvature in the front with a rubbery grip which helps to keep it from slipping in my hand - for all I know they all have this but again I have little to compare it to. My son has a Canon EOS 30D (released in 2000?) and I can say that this model is significantly lighter than his.LensesI did some research on lenses and boy are these puppies expensive! I appreciate having both the 18-55mm and 75-300mm lenses with this kit. As a beginner this will allow you to get all the basic pictures you could hope for all at once. I can take close up pictures and landscape pictures (the pictures I have included here were all taken with the lenses that came in this kit on my first few weeks using this camera). I'm sure there are much better lenses out there that come with a hefty price tag but for a beginner this kit will give you everything you need to get started and take some pretty decent pictures.LCD monitorThe picture on the monitor is pretty clear and I used this a lot my first couple days. Instead of looking through the eye piece I used the LCD display to shoot my pictures. As I became more familiar with the various ISO F/S and shutter speed settings I switched up to shooting using the eye piece and used the display to quickly see/adjust my manual settings.Picture qualityI'm pretty impressed. The pictures come out clear and sharp (assuming its correctly focused when on manual focus). The colors are bold and vibrant in my opinion. I don't think the pictures of my kids have ever turned out so good. Side note: I did start using the auto focus feature recently while on a road trip to be able to shoot faster and I am very please with how well the pictures turned out. It was quick to focus and will likely be using this feature often when I am out and about (with little time to set up the shot).I am incredibly happy with my purchase and if I had to do over again I would pick this model. After purchasing this camera I purchased a used Canon 30D for my son as he wanted to learn as well. In comparison the Canon EOS has come a long way in terms of design ease of use for a beginner and features but if anything I know based on having both a new and used (old) camera in the house now that they can stand the test of time if cared for properly. Oh and having a bag in the kit is also pretty handy.,1
DSLR Cameras,B01CO2JPYS,Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera…,        170 of 192 people found the following review helpful       Great entry level camera ...  May 2  2016By Paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The Canon Rebel T6 is also known as the 1300D throughout the world. Without getting too technical this model is a great entry level camera for novice photographers to learn the art of photography. The two lenses that are included provide the ability to take desirable photos near and far. It would be useful for anyone ordering this camera to remember lens filters in order to protect the lenses from debris and damage. You will need a few memory cards and extra batteries are always useful. The wifi feature means easy uploading to your smartphone for social media posting or sending via e-mail. I have used the Canon Rebel series in the past and have had good luck with the model.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01CO2JPYS,Canon EOS Rebel T6 Digital SLR Camera…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       A good intermediate camera.  December 6  2016By C. Fisher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought this camera to replace my Canon Rebel T2i that was water damaged irreparably. When choosing this model I preferred the options of the T6 over the more expensive T6i. For example I do not need stabilization because any lenses I have which may require it (mainly telephoto) incorporate that feature. I recommend any buyer carefully decide what features they'll actually use (not just what sounds good) before choosing between this model and the T6i. You may save yourself some money and still get a good camera. Also for anyone who may need it this model is very good in low light. If you shoot natural light photos (no flashes here I shoot insects and arachnids) you'll have more color range in lower light settings.,0

I was tired of the photo quality I was getting off of my Galaxy S5 and this camera went on sale on Black Friday for $450 with an additional lens bundle. It takes great photos for what I use it for. I use it to take photos outside and it does a great job even on just automatic settings. I have still not had the time to sit and read through the instruction manual and watch videos online. I can only imagine what it is capable of once I learn all the ins and outs of the manual settings.,0

May 9  2014By William Fredette-Huffman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I decided that this year would be the year that I learn photography and stop point and shooting.  I went round and round with which camera to buy.  I researched altered my budget researched some more. I made the mistake of not taking any online classes before buying my camera.  Look up some You tube videos on equipment and how to choose the best one for you.  There are no regreets with this purchase but I may have changed my strategy a bit if I knew then what I know now.I bought this camera over Nikon based on the ""live view mode"" and because most reviews stated that the Canon would be better for those trying to learn the various modes.  I can say this this is indeed true and this camera takes GREAT pictures.  I am completely happy. I also bought it for the video capability although the 70D was rated a little higher for video it was out of my budget.Some advice for fellow first time DSLR buyers:1. Spend the extra money for the 18-135 STM.  This was an instant regret that continues to haunt me.  This lens is phenomenal and takes GREAT pics but the added flexibility would be worth the extra money.  55mm is great for close up portraits this is a great wide angle lens but 55mm is short and I find that I have to change lenses more often than I would like.2. Budget for lenses not the camera body.  Camera bodies change like cell phones every few years there is an opportunity to upgrade.  Nice lenses will outlive multiple bodies.  The more classes I take the more I wish I had budgeted for lenses and every class video review will echo this.3. If you can find a package deal that includes the 55-250 STM lens it will save you $200...do it!!4. Buy a book besides the manual it really helped me to understand how the camera really works.  Also there is a great set of videos from ""The great courses"".  It is taught by a National Geographic photographer and at $80 has been really eye opening as far as taking great pictures.This T5i is a great camera for beginners and enthusiasts.  There is not much difference in this camera and the T4i.  I think touch screen is the biggest upgrade the touchscreen is awesome by the way.  The controls are easy to learn and use. I have not tested it but this camera may not tolerate wet weather like the 70D will.  Live view works well.  I have not used the video too much it worked well with 18-55STM but when I tried it with an older 70-300 kit lens it was very noisy and never focused right.  This was the lens not the camera hence my suggestion #3 above.  These kit Canon lenses have changed the game and they take great images.  You will not be disappointed but you may want to upgrade to more expensive lenses if you are doing more than chasing the kids around. A few review web sites even say that the images from these lenses rival more expensive ones.Whether you are delving into the world of exposure and trying to take wonderful images or this is to document vacations and family moments you will love this camera.Pros:1. Easy to use out of the box on ""green"" setting.2. Easy to learn exposure on in ""live view"" mode3. Screen is big bright and customizable4. Light enough everyday family use5.

Newberry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,For the past 4 years I shot a Canon Rebel XS and enjoyed it.  I got my T5i today and was blown away by the vivid colors the touch screen is a great thing.  I bought the body only and shoot with a 18-135mm lens.  This is a great combination and am very pleased with the purchase.,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LWO4,Canon EOS Rebel T5i EF-S 18-55 IS STM…,        52 of 53 people found the following review helpful       10 zooms outta 10 <<<<<<<<<<<  March 13  2014By Movieskinny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,HISTORY_This is my first SLR camera of any kind. My first was a 1960s Brownie Kodak that used 110 film then it was a 1980s Canon 35mm point n shoot someone gave me a 1990s Fujifilm 2mp camera to get in the age of digital the 2000s got more efficient with a Kodak P880 8mp semi-pro camera which was an awesome camera(they still sell for $100) and then Amazon forced me to get a Canon T5i. OK not quite at gun point but the deal was ridiculously good. After watching a YouTube review of the T3i vs. T5i it was NO contest.1st THOUGHTS_Canon almost got me on a 60x point n shoot at Costco but I payed the bigger bucks and am not sorry. I thought my Kodak pics with the nice S&K lens were great but these are WOW. The only pictures that don't turn out and look great are the ones I have been setting up on manual which produces wonderful results with a little more trial and error.PICTURES_I got it with only the stock 18-55mm lens and some of the Macro shots of spring blossoms fill an HDTV space with jaw dropping colorific pics. I just ordered the $10 macro reversing ring to play around with some superduper close-ups without having to spend $3-400 on the real macro stuff. Just about everything set on auto that I've taken turns out sharp and clear and seemed dud-proof. My friends are not the SLR owning crowd and have been very praising of the few shots I have shared.CAMERA BODY_I'm a big guy the camera is surprisingly light and is not a problem to wander around with this hanging about your neck or in a side bag. Construction seems to be of strong gauge plastic with not much metal visible. Strap is very comfy too. There is NO(?) connector string for the lens cap. Spinning and flipout color screen is very useful. I have already used it for taking pics at goofy angles which make using the eye piece impossible. Controls buttons and switches are layed out nicely The on-off switch and selector wheels literally feel like a Fisher-Price Toy they are so solidly built and seem like they may last a while. Nothing on the camera feels flimsy. The battery is doubled locked in it's compartment which I thought was an impressive touch. One drop and most batteries will barge their way out of a camera and damage the door.WHAT'S INSIDE_Having read many reviews before purchasing this unit I really liked the difference between the Canon and Nikon and the ones that put me over to Canon fast action photography and ease of controls use. Watch any sporting event and the only lenses you see on the sidelines are white Canon lenses for fast action play. The reviews appear to be correct. I read the manual on my Kindle computer and the book for the first week. I tried to get up to speed and the software and controls on the camera were very simple to follow. The camera actually gives you multiple ways to accomplish a software change with wheels direction buttons and a super nice touch screen display. Touch screen is one of the best parts of the camera. I tell people to read directions do they listen no. I do and it makes difference no matter what the electronics. Go to YouTube and watch videos it helps a lot.The battery charges fully in 1-2 hours. Having had the Kodak P880 before this did help ease into learning how to operate the camera. Read the directions and take pictures of anything as you go and see what they look like. I poked my head out the front door and took a handheld 3 second night exposure of streaky car traffic lights. A little unfocused but I learned how to do it when I have tripod in hand. I went back through some initial pics and post effected them with grainy BW or amped colors for some very nice artsy visuals. The software also defaults to save your original pic. The software discs that comes in the box provide manuals and very good picture editing tools. They call them professional but it isn't Adobe I know that much and does all I need it to do.HD VIDEO_I may add to this later. The STM lens focusing system is a must for video. I watched a YouTube video and the focusing is silent compared to lenses of the past. Even the USM lenses were adding noise to the video just like my old Kodak did. I have turned it on and the STM focusing is as advertised quiet! The T5i is STM approved. T3i...NOT.FINAL NOTES_Even if you just use the no-brainer settings the camera is well worth it. With IS(image stabilization) new STM(works on a sliding principle) lens focusing and other Canon technology the T5i will make your memories foolproof. There are pros doing reviews here on more technical items and I will not try to offer that level of reflection. I know how to build a great computer but have no where near mastered what this T5i is capable of. Many reviews say this is a good starter $700 camera and I believe them now but like the computers I build you need to do more than check mail. AND read the directions!! Professional photographers are spending thousands on just the body of a camera. I'm not there yet or maybe never. Right now the T5i looks pro enough.UPDATE 2015-06-24: I still really like my T5i!! After a year and a half of use and several thousand clicks to boot I know what it can and can't do well. I have even started doing some research into the 70D but not the LCD tiltless 7D which is the top of the line APS-C.  I'm going to update some pictures here also.  The T5i pictures are always downloaded to my computer and HDTV. These are ridiculously awesome viewed on a big screen. My friend has a very nice iMac Apple computer and they do not measure up to the HDTV at 46 inches or larger.I just returned form Yosemite Kings Canyon Lassen volcano and several zoos with picture you can only stare at in amazement. Vacation photos and video never looked so good. The T5i has a 4 second video snapshot feature that stiches all the clips together for one movie. Your friends will love you because they don't need to watch home movies lasting more than a few minutes. At zoos this is a huge bonus. The T5i is not the pinnacle of cameras but it can make you look like a pro to your non techie friends and easily. One more tip on video and this is fun. Load the supplied software connect your camera to the PC convert some of your favorite music to WAV(only) download the WAV files to your SD card via the usb cable and voila you hear your music instead of the low quality sound picked up by the in-camera mike. Turn off the mike so that it is silent. Also turn on the audio wind filter if you want that sound. I listen to my videos with the new Sherlock Holmes BBC soundtrack goes with everything.I really thought the versatile LCD screen would be really nice for photo taking but is just useful for some video and video viewing.  The eye piece viewer is still the best for picture taking. One thing I just learned I have always left the image stabilizer on. I have started using the camera without it and have had some revelating(new word) results. The image stabilizer holds the camera back from doing instant focus. Getting a picture of a bee has been impossible with the IS on but off the T5i will focus instantly instead of hunting for AF and then it is too late. This is also the dilemma for video on the T5i and has tendency to hunt for focus. If you do the 4 second clip video sometimes half the clip is horribly blurred before snapping into clarity. Look at a guy like Ansel Adams(genius) the guy could out shoot 99.9 percent of the waking camera public with a shoe box pinhole camera. His favorite 'til the day he died was not a very a fancy camera in the least. It will always boil down to how good and persistent you are with whatever tool you have in the box.The t4i and t5i in the hands of real pros can produce stunning pictures but again one is older than the other. The main reason Canon dumped the t4i and you won't get them to admit it was too much zinc in the rubber grip handles. This produced several episodes of allergic skin reactions/discoloration of the grip itself and corporations run away from potential lawsuits with track shoes laced up. Since the t4i was dumped hurriedly Canon decided to add a few new great wrinkles to the mix mainly the STM lens line up and the battery will get you another 100 shots per charge(big plus). I think those two and no lawsuits are winners.The 70d and 7d(top o' line of APS-C) are just above this T5i in one and two position. Canon's 6D is the entry level full frame(non APS-C) but suffers the same video problems as the t5i or so I hear. The HD video performance on the 7's is outstandingly better than the t5i which sometimes has a tendency to hunt for focus with the image stabilizer on. 70d is another $300 more than the t5i and has better specs. 70d is $1100 with two lenses plus extras. It even has the new dual AF which really helps on the video end. I purchased the 55-250mm and it has been the biggest boost to my picture abilities. Only until a recent camping trip did I long for a 400mm when I got some decent pics of an Osprey across the river and high on a branch. My best nature shot so far. Generally the 250mm range gets you almost everything and nicely I will do a separate review of that lens. Some reviewers claim it is in L glass class and I believe it but have not used L myself.The T5i with two lenses and extras sells for $800 which is an unbelievable deal. The 70D is $1100-1200 and sports better specs than the T5i with two lenses and extras. For $300-400 more if the piggy bank allows buy the 70D with the new dual AF system wifi and more. So much for this update.,1

Easy to use and we love the touch screen.  The lens it comes with is good and versatile unlike some other kits.  We did buy a 50mm lens that is also amazing with this camera.  We bought this camera while expecting out first child instead of paying a photographer and it was one of the best purchases we made to help record beautiful moments.  No filters needed.,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LWO4,Canon EOS Rebel T5i EF-S 18-55 IS STM…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       I am stunned by the quality of this camera.  November 19  2016By keifernavey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am seeing some professional photographers saying they aren't a huge fan of the Rebel series but that's simply because their needs and talents have surpassed the level of the Rebel. I am not a professional photographer. That being said THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING!! I started taking photos with a Rebel xti which is about 10 years old so you can only imagine how excited I was to play with something from this decade. I love the swivel screen because it makes it easier to take pictures that are maybe lower to the ground (babies dogs etc) or at some other weird angles. While I haven't yet figured out the complexities of photography I wanted to share a few pictures I took so you could see the absolutely GORGEOUS quality of photos it takes. One of them you can see the little flecks of dust and pollen on a flower! Are you kidding me? If you're wanting to try photography as a new hobby or get a camera that can help you take photos of travels and family just take the plunge and buy this. I've been suggested to get the 55mm f/1.8 or even 55mm f/1.4 lens for great portraits but I haven't gotten it yet.,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LWO4,Canon EOS Rebel T5i EF-S 18-55 IS STM…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Great Camera for the Money.  November 12  2013By JohnNinCO,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I would consider myself a complete amateur photographer but with the desire to become better.  In my college years I took a lot of pictures with a 35mm Canon and loved doing it so I am a bit biased in the brand.  However I have used several Nikons and other brands as well so I have a bit of experience with the other brands.What I like about this camera is that it is easy to use if you want it to be and has quite a bit of adjustments if you want to try your hand at semi-professional photography.  Of course it is not full-framed but I really can not tell that much of a difference.You can set it to fully automatic and use it as a relatively easy point and shoot type or you can change the settings to suit your needs.  I tend to play around with different settings and see what works the best.  All my shots are in Raw mode so you do have some adjustments when you go to 'develop' the pictures.  It gives you a bit of more flexibility.Overall I like the shots that it takes.  I have taken some great shots with this and the color detail and clarity have been exactly what I wanted in a mid-range DSLR.  Usually I take outdoor shots so the lens is fine for what I am doing but if you want to take more indoor and portrait shots then definitely invest in a 50mm f1.4 or better lens.  Low light conditions with the kit lens will almost always require the flash and if you cant use flash will be a little dark.The video mode is great too.  So far I like the tracking feature of the autofocus and how quiet the lens is.  I have been experimenting with some different situations and like the quality of the videos.  Most of the video has been of recitals and indoor use and they have been good quality.  The mic works well although it might be better to have a separate mic for better quality.I give the product four stars because it pretty much does everything that I wanted in a camera however the kit lens is only so good.  It is perfect for what I need right now but as I get to be a better photography I am sure I will find its limitations. As far as the difference between the T4i and the T5i I have heard there is not much other than the lens.  If you are purchasing this for video use I would recommend this over the T4i other than that I believe they are very similar.,0

Schwab,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I previously owned the T3 and wanted to upgrade so I purchased the T5i (used) and have been using it since the day I received it. From what I read I expected to just receive the camera body but the seller included everything I needed to be up and running within a short span of time (had to charge the battery). I'm not a professional and this camera is very user friendly. I've yet to learn all the different modes etc. but for now I'm taking pictures that amaze even me. I'd recommend this for those who want great pictures but don't want to spend a small fortune. I mainly wanted this camera for bird pictures and here are two of my latest ones.,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LWO4,Canon EOS Rebel T5i EF-S 18-55 IS STM…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Great starter kit  November 25  2015By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this video bundle because it definitely seemed like the best deal at the time. Because it is essentially two separate products I am going to split the reviews.Canon T5i:Wonderful camera. It feels good in the hand and is very straight forward (and this is coming from an ex-Nikon guy). The touch screen is really neat but I don't use it a whole lot. The lens is a standard lens and should be expected to perform like one. The manual is also really straight forward but does lack some simple details such as how to attach the strap to the camera body. Though this isn't a difficult task it still would be nice to have in there for beginners. The camera is really what you would expect. It shoots wonderful photos with unlimited options when it comes to manual settings of aperture ISO or shutter speed. It is also very easy to change the video settings all with great resolution. It is also very easy for a rookie to figure these settings out just by playing around with it. It has a sturdy build and overall is a great purchase.Rode Videomic Go:The selling point for this set to me was really the microphone. The microphone is easy to attach to the mount and requires no batteries. It has no buttons and runs completely off of the camera which makes it very easy to use. I found two downsides to the mic and they are as follows. First of all the cable that runs between the mic and camera tends to get in the way a bit. There is a small slot on the mic shock mount that holds the cable back but it still seems to fall on to the screen of the camera. The second issue came to the actual mic sound itself. It does a great job of picking up sounds in the room including the lower range but it does seem to have a bit of a hissing in the back. It's not super noticeable but it is definitely there. Other than the cable and the white noise this is a great starter kit for videos on any DSLR. Comes with everything you need to get going.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LY2Y,Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR with…,        190 of 193 people found the following review helpful       Amazing little and lightweight Rebel.  January 12  2014By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Its been a few years since I owned a Rebel.  In 2004 I purchased the original Rebel 300D it was my first digital SLR.  I purchased it leaving my well loved film Minolta Maxxum 8000i behind.  Since that first original Rebel which I later gave to a friend I have purchased three (3) additional Canon camera bodies in the last 3 years.  A Canon 40D a Canon 7D and my current pro body and first full-frame the 5D Mark III.  Unfortunately magnesium alloy bodies can get very heavy and too big and noticeable for just casual shooting.  I wanted a smaller camera that I can have with me all the time but it seems like Sony has the best mirror-less camera as of the date of this writing (1/11/2014.  The Sony 7r would mean not only buying an expensive new body but new lenses.  I'm to heavily invested in Canon L and prime lenses today.Along comes this little gem the SL1 or 100D.  It is not mirror-less and if you connect a large lens it loses its size advantage quickly but with a smaller lens you essentially have a mini t5i that you can fit into a small backpack  and have with you all the time with very little  or no compromises.  Amazon's pricing during the 2013 Christmas holiday season made it even more irresistible -- a downright steal.  It has most of the features its bigger siblings in the Canon EOS lineup has with wonderful full-time hybrid CMOS autofocus during video mode shooting.  It has Multi-frame noise reduction high resolution rear touch screen shoots full HD 1080p at 30 fps most of its intelligent and creative modes allow shooting in RAW which If I remember correctly was not the case with earlier Rebel cameras; perfect for handing the camera off to friends and relatives to take a picture of you but yet still have some control over the exposure when you do and have a high quality CR2 raw file for further editing in Photoshop later.  It has amazing low light capability up to ISO 25600 14-bit per channel with highlight controls.  This little camera can also serve as a second camera because its compatible with all Canon's EOS lenses.  It has some creative filters although the miniature effect is the only one I like especially in video mode.  Some of the special effects can be added later after the photograph has been taken and it will allow you to apply the effect on a copy rather than the original photograph so you will have both the original photo and one with the special effect.  This little camera has built-in lens aberration correction and in camera cropping  just like its bigger brothers do and a programmable auto focus system like other Canon's do too. You can also program the asterisk button on the rear to detach auto focus from shutter release if you like this.  I have this setup on my Canon 5D Mark 3 and after getting use to it find it more useful than having AF and Shutter on a single button.  It has a mirror lockup to reduce vibration with larger telephoto lenses.  It has four metering modes evaluative partial spot  and center-weight metering modes.  Full data display with RGB or combined histograms  Auto Lighting Optimizer in camera HDR (3 frames)  touch screen LCD display that let you skip zoom in or out with your fingers with familiar finger gestures like those used for iPhone and Android.What it does lack is a headphone jack for monitoring audio levels the battery is small so video recording time will not be as good as other Canon cameras so have a charged up spare battery for recording video.  Lenses with IS switched on and using the built-in flash will kill the battery quickly.  But if you use a fast 50mm 1.8 or 1.4 or even the Canon 40mm f/2.8 STM lens you should get the most battery life you can per charge.  I think this is probably the best camera deal for dSLR photography especially if you can get it with instant cashback or rebates so shop around.Update  1/18/2014:Just thought I pass on this tip to other photographers.  The Opteka LP-E12 batteries make good additional batteries for the SL1.  They give you slightly more life and 1/4th the price of the original Canon battery.  Opteka LP-E12 2000mAh Ultra High Capacity Li-ion Battery Pack for Canon EOS-M & EOS Rebel SL1 DSLR Cameras  So if you shoot plenty of video the Opteka battery seems to be a good choice and at one fourth the price of the original Canon part you can have four times the battery life.,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LY2Y,Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR with…,        81 of 86 people found the following review helpful       I would make this purcahse again!  February 25  2015By ANC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love this camera!  I bought it to replace my Canon xTi (purchased in 2008) which still worked but I wanted a new camera because both the technology and my photography skills had gotten better in 7 years.  When I was doing my research on new DSLR cameras I had a hard time deciding which camera to buy.  It was between the t5 sl1 and t5i.  I chose this one because it had a better light sensor than the t5 and t5i but the price wasn't as high as the t5i.  At first I thought I needed a camera with more umph to increase my skills more (like the 70D).  I was worried because this camera is advertised as a beginners camera and hoped that I would be bored with it.  I am definitely NOT bored!  I feel like it's easy enough for a beginner but there is so much to learn with photography that it will propel you forward for quite awhile.  I love how it's a rebel series and I knew how to use it out of the box because it was so similar to the xTi.  Of course there are a lot of similarities between the xTi and the SL1 like the ISO can go much higher than the xTi but I usually stay under 400 as much as I possibly can but in the higher numbers the pictures look better compared to the same ISO as the xTi.  Everything looks better with this camera!The first thing I noticed about this camera is how small and lightweight it is.  I can take 800 pictures in an hour and at the end of the shoot I don't have as much of a camera shake problem from having a tired hand.  The quality of the pictures are fantastic.  The pictures are coming out so super clear that there is almost too much detail and I find myself photoshop-ing the crust off my baby's nose!  In reality though I don't spend nearly as much time fixing the photos as I used to.  Most of the images I submitted are original and untouched.  Additionally the SL1 is a super fast camera and can keep up with toddlers very easily.  A few things that I love that I didn't know I would love is the touch screen.  I also love the super quiet auto-focus on the STM lens.  And I love how I can use all my old Canon lenses and gear that I have collected over the years.This camera is quickly becoming my go-to camera because of the pictures that come from it.  In the two weeks I've had it I've already taken several thousand pictures and at the end of my shoots I have a higher % of good pictures compared to the other cameras I own and tested before buying this one.  Bottom line I would make this purchase again in a heart beat and this time I wouldn't take to long to decide on this camera!,1
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LY2Y,Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR with…,        496 of 529 people found the following review helpful       Best combination of image quality  viewfinder  and size  May 3  2013By Doctor.Generosity,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I am impressed with my new Canon SL1 with the 18-55 kit lens. As a long time dedicated amateur photographer with a shelf full of other equipment including fancier and much more expensive equipment this will now be the one I take with me and use most of the time. Here's why:* Incredibly small and incredibly light. The biggest single reason for the recent spate of mirrorless cameras (Sony NEX Fujifilm X) is now negated! I am sitting here looking at the SL1 next to my Fujifilm XE-1 with a comparable 18-55 zoom lens. The SL1 is lighter and smaller than the Fuji mirrorless camera with its electronic viewfinder. The SL1 optical viewfinder while more compressed than the one in a large high-end DSLR to my eyes is still far superior to any electronic viewfinder which is like looking at a fuzzy little television from the 1960's. Canon appears to have achieved the small size by repackaging the sensor and shutter; impressive engineering and I expect that Nikon and others will have to follow suit. Let's hope we will now see a new generation of tiny DSLRs.*Image quality: OK you say it's small. So what am I giving up? Answer is - not really much. Image quality is excellent. The electronics of sensors have advanced rapidly in the last few years and the newest entry level camera is going to perform better than the high end product you bought two years ago. And new half frame sensors may be comparable to full frame sensors from a few years back. Also the entry level DSLR market is the most competitive. Nikon (D3200) and Canon (SL1 or T5) are forced to give you more for your money than with high end full frame cameras. The SL1 is a bargain. Yes you can get a marginal improvement in images and controls by going up market but you will pay 3X as much in dollars and in weight and in volume. The cost of any technology is usually on a log scale; 90% of state of the art costs X and 95% costs 3X and 99% costs 9X. It makes no sense to ride this curve unless you do very specialized or commercial photography. For most of us the most important thing is whether we have the camera with us when the photo opp comes up.*Comparison. The images coming out of this Canon SL1 are lovely contrasty and with excellent colors. I compared directly with my full frame Nikon D600 and also Sony NEX 6 at ISO 400. Results; unless you are a fanatical pixel peeper they are all in the same ballpark. Only by blowing up the central 10% to fill the computer screen can one begin to see significant differences. If you do make this extreme blowup the full frame D600 had the cleanest lowest noise and finest detail. But then the D600 costs 4X the SL1 and weighs more than twice as much! And anyway does it really matter if some other sensor is s-l-i-g-h-t-l-y better? No it doesn't. Having the 'best' equipment is just not the determining factor in capturing beautiful photos that I will take pride in years down the road. The SL1 gives me 90% of the quality I will get from any camera anywhere at 1/4 the cost of a high end DSLR. The main difference is that the viewfinder is cramped and the settings are in menus rather than dedicated buttons. Big deal. You can still do any creative thing you want and win photo contests with this camera.*How about the kit lens?: Just fine. By profession I am interested in the details of lens design and I admire beautiful finely crafted Zeiss lenses just as much as as the next fanatic. But as a photographer I can tell you that for actually capturing once-in-a-lifetime handheld photo opportunities with a sharp high quality image there are two things that matter much more than ultimate optical quality: a) image stabilization and b) zoom so you can scale the desired image to fill your sensor. Are high quality prime lenses ""better?"" In practical terms usually not. For most photography they will not produce a more detailed image unless your camera is on a tripod and the scene just happens to be matched to the focal length. For general opportunistic or travel photography squeezing out the last iota of lens quality is close to irrelevant. This is especially so these days when the camera JPG engine corrects typical lens defects such as distortion and chromatic aberration automatically. Modern lenses no longer have to be perfect in the glass; they all end up pretty much alike after the software corrections are applied. This is also why spending hours diddling around with RAW images in Photoshop no longer makes much sense for most of us - the JPEG engine has been programmed to optimize the specific lens - and it will take much time and skill to equal or improve on this on one's own. Today post processing is not optional so JPEG is how cameras should be judged.Image stabilization in particular has a lot more to do with sharpness for handheld photos then ultimate lens quality. The stabilization on this Canon lens works fine showing its best advantage with shutter speeds around 1/10 to 1/25 second and giving effective reduced jitter as if you were shooting at 1/200. (If the required exposure is much slower than 1/25 let's say 1/5 or slower even IS will not help - and if it's much faster don't need IS and it won't improve anything.) And as noted using a zoom has a lot bigger impact on quality then the niceties of a prime lens because one doesn't need to crop down. If I crop to the central 1/4 of the image area because my lens did not frame the scene optimally I am throwing away 3/4 of my pixels so I no longer have 18MP anyway. Overall results will be better with a zoom even if it's optically imperfect.*So is mirrorless no longer needed? There is one factor which does still favor mirrorless over SLR; the size of lenses which are limited by the laws of physics and the long flange-to-sensor distance that comes with an SLR mirror. For the Canon SL1 or any SLR zoom lenses will usually be bigger than the body. So I also bought the 40mm f2.8 Canon pancake lens which is compact for walk-around although if I have to use a fixed lens I would prefer a wider angle. Canon makes a dozen other mid range zooms such as the 15-85 but you will have to accept a weight of 575-645 g compared to 205 g for the kit lens. In fixed focal lengths Canon also makes two nice wide angle (24 mm and 28mm) lenses with image stabilization that weigh only 260-281 g and would offer a good match for the SL1. The 50mm f1.8 should be considered instead of the 40mm; faster and costs less. And of course you may already own a shelf full of Canon EF or EF-S lenses.*But isn't the SL1 plasticky? Yes it is plasticky and there are tacky ""sculpted"" buttons on the back ala consumer cameras and the shutter release is not as snappy as my Nikon D600. It does not give the impression of a professional tool. I regret that Canon interpreted ""small and light"" as ""entry level;"" I would have been willing to pay more for a compact but higher precision package. But it's also very light. And it's so handy I'm going to take it with me when I travel as opposed to leaving my big full frame Nikon at home. And if it gets stolen or dropped not such a tragedy. Every camera is a compromise. In my opinion enthusiasts sometimes obsess too much over 'build quality.' Yes there is a tactile pleasure to high precision Leicas from the 1950's but that kind of mechanical quality is no longer necessary for quality photos. Cameras today like so many other products are made of plastic and software but the results - photographs - are better than ever.*Interface and ease of use. Canon along with all other Japanese camera brands cram their interfaces with all sorts of useless clutter in the form of indecipherable icons unnecessary modes and confusing redundancies. What does that odd little icon which looks like an upside down flag with a teardrop mean? Why not just use plain old WORDS to label it? And has anyone you know actually used the ""Food Mode?"" Is it really more convenient to have three or four redundant ways to change the ISO setting or just confusing? Canon and the other makers should really drastically simplify the whole thing - look at your iPhone which does many more things than a camera but has very few icons and labels and buttons. All the major Japanese cameras have the same overly complicated philosophy but the SL1 Canon is somewhat easier to figure out than most and the touch screen is a definite plus. In any case although this is considered an 'entry level' DSLR the full manual nevertheless runs to 388 pages so plenty of options. There is also a remote control available as an option to get yourself in family photos or for nature photography. In short there is very little you can't do with the SL1.*Flaws? There is one real photographic deficiency. When I switch to Live View for still photos (this means lock up the mirror and use the LCD to frame photos like a point-and-shoot) the autofocus becomes very slow and hunts for a lock. The mirrored autofocus runs on a fast phase detection principle but in Live View the sensor focusses using some combination of contrast detection (slow in poor light) with special phase pixels. The solution; don't use Live View for still photos keep it for movies. Other minor annoyances: the on/off switch is not in the most natural place. Also the optical viewfinder picture is not only cramped but also does not capture 100% of the full sensor field; more like 79% so you will have to learn to compensate by overfilling the viewfinder frame a bit. I wish the buttons on the back were bigger (Note to Canon: Just because the back of the camera is small does not mean the buttons have to be small - get it?) Finally the flash pops up when I don't want it to although there is mode dial setting to suppress that.*Movies. Since one cannot use the optical SLR viewfinder to make movies an SLR like this is not really the best camera for movies. In you want to concentrate on movies the Sony NEX design is much better suited.*Bottom line: This is a great little state of the art camera and lens which takes lovely still photos without much fuss in an affordable tiny package. It benefits from the latest up to the minute sensor technology the photos are quite comparable to high end mirrorless or other half frame DSLR cameras and only slightly inferior to full frame costing much more and weighing much more. Yes it is cluttered with too many modes and icons but they all do that. With the kit lens you get the benefits of zoom and image stabilization and still the overall package is very portable. There is very little one might wish to do in art photography which cannot be done with the SL1. Speaking for myself a small half-frame camera with an optical viewfinder is just the ticket - the best overall combination of image quality viewfinder and functionality for the size and weight. It seems to me that the main justification for half frame mirrorless designs with electronic viewfinders has been negated. Is there a time when I won't use the SL1? Yes for street photography where people may be intimidated by having a camera pointed at them - the Sony NEX with its articulated rear display is better for that. But for any photography where SLR works best Canon has produced an advance similar to that of the Olympus OM series in the 1970's. Small is beautiful. Bravo Canon; you will sell a lot of these!Note added in response to comments below:Thanks to everyone who commented but perhaps I did not make my viewpoint clear. Yes I know a knowledgable PhotoShop artist who spends time fiddling with an image may produce a better result than the in-camera JPEG. That's not the point. Post RAW processing is no longer optional since lenses are now designed assuming their distortions and aberrations will be corrected in software. Since the efficiency of the in-camera JPEG is part of the product and the mode most people will use it should be part of the review. For any hobbyist who insists on doing it all by hand be my guest knock yourself out!Second yes it is possible to get somewhat better somewhat lower noise images at high ISO from a full frame sensor such as the D600. But in my tests this was only apparent if I crop to a small part of the original image. Normally the difference - in my judgement - is not great enough to make it worth lugging the big heavy D600.One more update: Consumer Reports just reviewed the SL1 and rated it near the top of DSLR overall",0

January 24  2014By hml.anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm not going to go too in depth with a review because there are several other professional photographers who know what they're talking about. I'm just a beginner photography enthusiast obsessive photo taker and first time DSLR user. In my opinion: this camera is AMAZING.I'll review the ergonomics and leave out the tech specs and photo quality to the professionals here. :)Let me preface that I'm a petite female 5'1 with small hands. What is comfortable for me may not be comfortable for you.INTERFACE:- Tons of settings features and options. I still have so much to learn on how to utilize all the functions!- Very friendly and intuitive interface. I've picked up other DSLR's and have found the menu and options to be quite intimidating. But I've been able to navigate around the menus on this camera very easily!- The camera display provides a lot of helpful tips and short explanations of what certain functions are (you can hide these tips in the menu option)- The touch screen is AWESOME. It doesn't seem prone to finger prints or scratches which I find very appealing!SIZE/WEIGHT:I was really intrigued by the whole ""World's Smallest and Lightest DSLR"" claim (reminder: I'm a petite 5'1 female).- Holding this camera is VERY comfortable for me. The hand grip is perfect and my hand doesn't hang off the bottom of the camera. There's also enough room for MY fingers (I've read other reviews say it's too small for their hands so I emphasize 'my').- As an obsessive photo taker I bring my camera with me EVERY where.. thus mobility is really important for me. This camera is incredibly light and I've noticed an obvious difference when holding this camera to other Rebels or Nikon DSLRs. It's really easy for me to carry around; when I'm traveling or hiking I normally just keep it around my neck cause it's so light and convenient. I've held up my camera for long periods of time and I've never had an issue with feeling tired or my hands cramping.- The lens that comes with this camera is a good size.. but if you upgrade to a larger telephoto the lens will definitely outweigh the camera body itself. It'll cause an uneven weight distribution and may become a little more uncomfortable to hold up with one hand. But since I'm still a beginner I don't plan on upgrading my lens any time soon.If you're upgrading from a P&S and want a great beginner DSLR I HIGHLY recommend this camera.If you want a small light and convenient-to-carry-around DSLR I HIGHLY recommend this camera.Love love love it!",0
DSLR Cameras,B00BW6LY2Y,Canon EOS Rebel SL1 Digital SLR with…,        60 of 63 people found the following review helpful       As capable as any Canon APS-C camera  in a great small package  July 8  2013By Peter Cotsis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm a long time Canon owner/user the SL-1 is my fourth digital Rebel.  I had a T3i that I purchased a year ago and I loved that camera.  When I saw the SL1 I was intrigued so I ordered it.  Very happy with the SL1 gives up nothing to the T3 except that the LCD screen is fixed not swiveling but I didn't use the swivel feature anyway and the SL1 adds a very capable touchscreen that really works.  I love the small size paired with a smaller kit lens (I have the 18-55USM IS that came with the T3i which is a bit smaller than the current STM lens they package these cameras with today) it is a VERY portable and light full featured DSLR. I also have the 15-85mm 10-22mm and 55-250 canon zooms all terrific lenses in their own right (particularly the 15-85 GREAT all around lens).  Those lenses add weight and bulk but the smaller camera body size still helps and you can always put the kit lens on when you want the light/compact camera to carry around.Image quality is superb acceptable noise on images I shot the other night in a dimly lit coffee house @ 3200 ISO.Best camera I've owned.  I did a lot of research to see if I could justify an upgrade to a Canon 6D or 5D but the price penalty (thousands for new camera bodies and lenses) and the weight and bulk penalty (considerable) didn't justify what I consider to be marginal improvements in image quality at least for my needs which are partly professional (I used this camera quite a bit for work) and for my own personal photography.So take the plunge my guess is 90% of you will love this camera.  The camera feels higher quality to me than the T3i nicer cosmetics slightly higher quality plastics used.,0

Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,We purchased this camera as a backup body and lightweight addition as an alternative to our Canon EOS 70D and EOS 6D cameras. My wife and I are semiprofessional photographers.Pros:1. Very small but still easy to use in relatively large hands.2. Light weight.3. Excellent results with typically smooth Cannon pictures that compare very well with the 70D at the default settings.4. Takes all our EF-S lenses.5. Excellent ergonomics. Controls in just the right place and anyone familiar with the Canon EOS series should be able to operate it efficiently without reference to the manuals.6. Fast and accurate focusing.7. Low light performance matches 70D with quick and accurate focusing in very low light.8. Good build quality. It is plastic but it is solid and does not 'creak'. Not quite as good as Nikon equivalents e.g. D60 D3200 etc.9. 18 to 55 mm STM kit lens has virtually silent focusing.10. Touch screen works beautifully.Cons:1. Supplied 18 to 55 mm STM kit lens is rather large for the camera and makes it difficult to carry. Optional 40 mm STM lens is much more compact but obviously not as flexible. New Nikon 18 to 55 mm lens shows the way forward with its collapsing lens barrel for carrying. I also do not like the plastic mount on the 18 to 55 mm kit lens since they wear and can be damaged easily. The optional 40 mm lens is a metal mount which is much more robust. Only and issue if you swap lenses frequently.2. The obvious compromise that some of the more esoteric settings are buried in menu items rather than as buttons for direct control but the touch screen mitigates some of those misgivings.3. Larger lenses make the camera unbalanced in the hand. No obvious way around this as this is a result of the small size. You cannot have small size and light weight but expect it to be OK with larger heavier lenses.Overall a very nice camera and would make a superb entry point to the Canon range of EOS cameras. Careful choice of lenses is important in order to make sure the camera handles well.,0

May 28  2015By Jacob,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera is fantastic and it has everything a beginner would want and more.So far I am very satisfied with this camera and it takes fantastic photos. I say this would be a good camera for a beginner because it is sort of an entry level camera. I feel like some people seem to think that entry level camera aren't very good that does not apply to this camera at all. It has all the buttons and knobs a person could want and all in a pretty small package.This camera is pretty small compared to bigger cameras like the t5i or the 70d. It is somewhat the size of a bigger mirrorless camera which for me is fine because I don't need a big camera to do big task. The only little annoyance is that the grip is pretty small but it is duable.Overall I definitely think this camera is worth your money and should be a camera to consider buying.IMAGES TAKEN WITH a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens.,1

I am amazed at all that this little camera can do! The size is perfect and feels super comfortable in my hands unlike other ones I've held. The quality of the pictures produced by this camera are GORGEOUS and professional looking. I actually Shocked myself when I headed to the park with my daughter and just took pictures of her playing. I tried the video camera feature and was a little disappointed that it would pause the video when I took pictures (while in video mode). It may be due to me not knowing all the features of the camera but I'll get it. If you're a quick learner you wont be disappointed. I highly recommend getting the bundle being that it'll save you money in the long run. Also include the free accessories and you are set! I am certain that I will be enjoying this camera for many years to come and I very highly recommend it! Whether you are an amateur or a pro photographer you will absolutely love this camera! I've posted a few shots taken with this camera using the close lens and the 75-300mm one.,1

I purchased it about 3 weeks ago before a vacation to Dubai and my pictures were amazing.  After only a few weeks I still do not know how to use all the features but I'm learning.  The camera itself is very user friendly with many automatic settings and pre-set settings.  The size is also nice not to heavy to carry around all day and fit nicely in my crossbody purse.  Overall I am very happy with it.,1

Brown,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The SL 1 is a less expensive alternative to some of the mirror-less fixed lens cameras that have become so popular. With its APS-C sensor and 18 megapixel resolution it is adequate for most ordinary shooting situations. It appealed to me because my kit is all Canon and my current lens fit on it. Coupled with my 40mm pancake lens (one of these days I'll get a wider lens) it has become my walking around camera when I don't  want to lug my 5D around. Some people have complained that its small size makes it somewhat awkward to use but I haven't found that to be a problem.,0

I'm an amateur enthusiast and I'm learning a lot on this compact SLR; It's compatible with all of Canon's lenses and my photographer friends are able to teach me on it with their accessories flashes and lenses because of that. It takes amazing 1080p video and with the mic that comes as part of this kit the audio is very clear and loud. The articulating screen which is a touchscreen is intuitive and useful for reviewing photos and for setting up focus for shots and video. I love the wifi feature to transfer photos to my phone quickly. Overall there's nothing more I could ask for in a camera. It's lightweight enough to carry around without issues but sturdy enough to have a substantial feeling in my hands. And the kit lens does a pretty good job even if the zoom is obviously not as far as a longer lens would be. I'm very happy with this camera and satisfied with my investment.,0

You can connect it to your pc and use it as a web cam through the canon software from the website which i find is super cool and it makes moving video and pictures off of it super easy as well.,0

The kit comes with plenty of materials that helped me get started and I couldn't be happier with the results I've gotten. I'm still learning the techniques but I'd say this is a great DSLR to start out with and it can be used equally well in the hands of an amateur or a professional.

Perkins,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Update 1.30.16:  Added stuff about remote shooting.Update 1.29.16:  Notes added to bottom of review.Camera fails in one of its basic features- wifi.  The thing I want to do the thing I expect as a basic feature of a camera advertising wifi connectivity is to take a picture without a wired connection and have that picture appear on my computer automatically.  The T6i does not appear to do this.  It's like having a car that only works in 3rd gear on Sunday afternoons.  I was able to get the camera to connect to my computer over wifi but I couldn't leave the menu page inside the camera without turning the connection back off.  I was able to get the Remote Shoot feature in the included program (Digital Photo Professional 4) to work but only when the camera is connected by USB.  The program does not sense the camera over wifi.  I was able to get the camera to connect to my cell phone by wifi.  I'm rating this as 2 stars instead of 3+ due to the lack of a basic feature and 2 stars instead of 1 because the camera works fine other than the wifi.Update:  Bumped up to 3 stars.  Figured out how to add web services (email and Facebook as a test for me).  Camera has to be plugged in to computer by USB and I had to be logged in to Canon Image Gateway online.  I'm still not entirely happy because I have to go into the web services menu and tell the camera to upload to a given service.  I might bump it to 4 or 5 stars if I can get the Canon Android app to automatically save pictures to a folder on my phone (ex:  Dropbox) that would automatically upload the picture.I don't expect to ever be in a confrontational situation with my camera certainly not with law enforcement but here's an example of what I want to be able to do with the camera's wifi feature.  Let's say I'm the guy with the camera recording the Rodney King beating.  I want to be able to go 'click' take a picture and know that that picture exists somewhere- with no further action on my part- other than the camera itself. Maybe I'm taking pictures/video of a natural disaster or some other situation where the SD card the camera or even I might not survive the encounter.*****Update 1.30.16:**********Canon T6i Setup*****Do this first before doing anything with the camera itself:The CD ""Canon EOS Digital Solution Disk"" install everything from that.

DSLR Cameras,B00U2W45WA,Nikon D7200 DX-format DSLR Body (Black),        234 of 256 people found the following review helpful       I'm pleased with the D7200 so far.  March 23  2015By P. Shepard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"NIKON D7200 REVIEWI have always appreciated it when others especially early adopters/buyers take the time to write a thoughtful review of their own experiences with cameras and other equipment that I am interested in here on Amazon.Thus my motivation for this review is to- pay it back.My photo interests are photographing wildlife birds (especially hummingbirds) people & groups- pretty general stuff. While I do not make my living at photography I have been studying and working at improving my photography for many years.Presently I have and use the Nikon D300 & D600. Generally I keep a long lens on the D300 (a DX-crop-sensor body) for immediate use if/when wildlife wanders by as we live in a rural setting. The D600 (a FX or full-frame body) is my workhorse camera that I carry with me just about all the time.  I had a D7000 (DX body) but gave it as a gift to my wife when upgrading to the D600. I really enjoyed using the D7000 but  no getting a gift back once given!(If interested you can view examples of my photography at:  www dot flickr dot com/photos/pms_swim/  --  You will need to replace dot with a period (.)  Amazon still strips out web addresses in reviews I think). Anyway I decided to get a newer DX body as I have been using the D600 (FX) exclusively & would like to experience just a tad more reach a DX body provides with birds in flight with the lenses I use.Initially I purchased a refurbished D7100 (DX) -it seems like a nice camera but the copy I got had a very dirty sensor & I returned it. Thus I decided to buy a new body but could not find a great deal to warrant the expenditure at that point. This was before I heard about the D7200.Sothat is  how I came to pre-order a D7200 after reading about features and so forth. I was attracted to the fast shutter speeds up to 1/8000 sec (my D600 only goes to 1/4000 sec) the faster frame rate & relatively larger buffer the upgrade with auto-focus (AF). I am not into video yet but note that the D7200 seems capable.Likewise I am not sure I will use the wireless feature but hope to explore it soon.One obstacle I had to accept when ordering the D7200 is the lack of software support.In preparation for arrival of new camera I updated my Nikon software on one computer:switching from View NX to the just released  View NX-I and from Capture NX2 to the new Capture NX-Dso I would have software on hand to read the D7200  NEF (RAW) photo files.You probably have noticed that there always seems to be lag time in getting upgrades to photo software (e.g. Adobe) that accommodates the photo files produced by new cameras. I also purchased an inexpensive OP/TECH USA SUPER CLASSIC uni-loop camera strap  (here on Amazon) to replace the gaudy  NIKON camera straps. In addition to appearing more low-key when out & about with the camera it allows for easy switching to / from a wrist strap and for the temporary removal of the neck strap when placing camera on a tripod if desired.Another plus/factor in buying this camera is that it uses the same Nikon battery as the D600 so I have spares already on hand.Likewise the SD/SDHC memory card slot(s) use the same memory cards I have a supply of.AND THE CAMERA ARRIVED TODAY! I was a tad concerned to see that Amazon only packed the camera box inside another box without any additional packaging (air space) materials otherwise the out of the box experience was pretty great.  I slipped a charged battery in place & 2 SDHC cards & formatted them placed the 24-120mm F/4 Nikon AF-S lens on.Then I walked around the pond on a rare (of late) sunny day here in southwest Arkansas. (see photos). I was adjusting menus as I went. The AUTO  setting produced nice photos in the shade but was trying to POP UP  the flash with bright backgrounds so I switched to aperture priority & set the ISO about 500.Also I am used to setting the AE-L/AF-L button on back as my AF on button and use the shutter only for metering & shutter release. I had some initial confusion in doing this as the AUTOFOCUS menu scrolls up into MOVIE settings & I kept missing that detail. I eventually remembered how to set the AE-L/AF-L button & shutter release button correctly. Fortunately one of the cats accompanied me on the stroll around the pond & proved to be a great model for trying AF with & without 3d tracking AF on. Using 3d tracking AF II was able to fire away & capture most of the shots in sharp focus as the cat rushed toward me. Without 3d tracing AF II would only get the initial photo in focus. The autofocus is very quick. I also took photos of bees in front of their hive birds in flight  fish on the surface of the pond and several flowers. The exposure and colors on the back of the camera (saving both NEF to card 1 JPG to card 2) look great. Now over exposed  several photos on this very bright day but that was more camera operator error.  I will want to try the AF later near dusk to see how camera operates in lowlight.I will try to post these examples (cat fish on pond daffodils birds in flight  honey bees peach blossoms) for your viewing. NoteI still need to open & review the camera manual.  Nor have I loaded the photos into the computer to see what ViewNX-I or Capture NX-D do with the NEF (RAW) files.I will try to update if there is any interest. I will also try to answer any questions.UPDATE: for past couple of days  I have tried to strip the non-characters"" from this review but they keep showing back up so i nuked review & tried to redo. We will see. sorry. best intentions gone astray.Using the 300mm f/4 AF-S Nikor prime lens gives me hope that the autofocus will perform admirably. I took some photos of birds about bird feeder & will try to post them here also. (NOTE: photos that I am attaching are from NEF files converted via VIEW NX-I at about 60% balance quality/compression to jpgs. trade off size of file vs. helping you view details. I will also post to my FLICKR site at 100% (see address above in review). Also I am having to learn how to use new Nikon Capture NX-D & View NX-I.",1
DSLR Cameras,B00U2W45WA,Nikon D7200 DX-format DSLR Body (Black),        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       I LOVE this camera!  June 5  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After a lot of research I decided to buy this camera and I couldn't be happier with my purchase - I love it! Previously I was using the Nikon D5300 a fantastic camera in its own right. When it became damaged I had to decide whether to replace the same model or upgrade to a new camera. Other reviewers have given great reviews on the technical aspects already but since some of you may be wondering whether to jump from the 5000 series to the 7000 series like I did I thought I'd offer my humble comparison.The two camera models are similar but different enough that it will take some time to get used to the change. I am still trying to learn the ins and outs of the D7200 because it offers so many more options; if you want bells and whistles the D7200 has them: an in-camera level more buttons to make quick changes or assign them to new uses and quicker access to settings are a few that come to mind. Back button focus (if you use it as I do) takes a few extra steps to set up than I remember it on the D5300 but this camera offers it and it works perfectly. Performance-wise it is not so very different from the D5300 but the D7200 seems to lock focus just a tiny bit faster and more accurately especially in low light and I'm able to bump my ISO a bit higher without as much noise as before. One other reason I chose this camera is that it has the auto fine-tuning feature which allows you to fine tune your lenses to the camera which the D5300 did not have. I have had lens focus issues in the past and this camera has helped me to make sure my lenses are ready to go.As to the camera body it is water resistant and pretty rugged which gives me greater peace of mind when I'm out shooting in a light sprinkling of rain or at the beach. I haven't done any accidental drop tests yet (knock on wood) but it certainly feels heavy and sturdy. One thing the D7200 does not have which I had on the D5300 and do miss having is an adjustable angle viewing screen on the back. On the D7200 it is attached to the back of the camera which helps with the weatherproofing aspect but makes it difficult for me to see the screen when I'm lying on the ground shooting and impossible while taking a self-portrait. The top-mounted LCD is fantastic for quickly changing my settings. I also love that it has a light I can turn on and off when needed. The weight difference between the D5300 and the D7200 is noticeable (the D7200 is heavier) but it's not uncomfortable to hold. The battery life is also noticeably longer on the D7200 (previously I kept three batteries in my camera bag; now I carry just two).In all I have been so happy with the performance I have gotten out of this camera. I doubt I will be upgrading anytime in the next decade because it does such an amazing job for me that I have no need of anything else.,0

Low light and high ISO settings performance are much better and the focusing system is extremely good (more accurate focusing over the D7100). I take this camera everywhere I go and just love the photos coming out of this camera. This camera has the performance of Nikon's full frame cameras but at the price of a cropped sensor camera. All the controls and dials are very well thought out and it won't be a stranger if you're used to Nikon D610 and D750. Unless you need the ultimate low light performance of a full frame camera (which is marginally better than this camera) then the D7200 is the right camera for a semi-pro shooter. I ended up leaving my Nikon D810 at home most of the time and this little guy gets to travel with me 90% of the time. Just get some good lenses for it and you will be amazed by the quality of this camera.,1

July 15  2015By Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,We bought this camera primarily for my wife and our photography business. We have both been using the Nikon D7000 but didn't upgrade when the D7100 came out because it seemed to be an incremental upgrade and not worth the cost at least at that time. The D7200 on the other hand was quite a jump from our D7000 and we decided to pull the trigger and get one after hearing of the product release.The D7200 has performed perfectly and the jump in low light capabilities helps tremendously. We may not upgrade our second D7000 this year but will definitely be getting another D7200 when we do.,0

Lavaroni,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It had been a long time since I had time for photography and I was not sure I really needed a DSLR when there are so many decent point and shoot systems out there.  But I am really glad I took the chance on this camera.  I had forgotten how much I loved photography and how good I actually was.  This camera challenges me to make critical decisions about my photography and gives me the tools to execute on the decisions I make.  I jumped right back in and am shooting almost entirely on manual mode and the quality of my shots is outstanding (most of the time ;-).  I am trying to give the Program modes a shot at making some of the decisions for me - especially when I am not in a thinking mood and just want to shoot like a P&S and they do a great job. I'll never make money off my photography but I have quickly become the defacto photographer for every family event and it is always with me on my hikes and travels and has all the settings I need to switch from street to landscape to portraiture depending on where I am at any given moment.  I have a long way to go before I master all the intricacies but this system has reawakened a passion in me and makes me feel like a kid again exploring a talent that I had let go completely dormant.  If you can commit some time to practice and want the flexibility and power that a DSLR can give you the D7200 is a great camera for prosumers and has a decent selection of DX lenses.  It would be nice if Nikon would invest in super wide DX lenses the way they do for FX but off brand manufacturers are filling the space nicely.  Unless you need massive enlargements I doubt you will ever miss the full format system.,1

There was nothing wrong with my old camera but I wanted to upgrade anyway.  The kit lens does a great job of being a nice walk around lens.  I don't find myself swapping lenses nearly as much.  I also really like the built in wifi feature.  I took some photos at a nephews graduation and afterwards I was able to drop them into the family's phones so they could do the usual uploads to social media and email them to other family.  Have 2 SD slots is a nice touch as you can set one to store images in JPEG and the other in RAW.  While I did like the flip out screen on my D5100 I didn't use it all that often so I don't think I will miss it much.  I think this camera is a great stepping stone before going to full frame.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01BUYK04A,Canon EOS 80D Digital SLR Camera Body…,        145 of 161 people found the following review helpful       Wonderful DSLR for general photography and YouTubers  March 27  2016By P.K. Frary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I replaced my well worn 70D with a shiny new 80D and although they look and feel similar I found the 80D laden with new features and image quality improvements over its predecessor.CONTROLS: Buttons and wheels feel sturdy and may be used while looking through the viewfinder. Exposure modes are set with a topside knurled dial: manual semi-auto modes and assorted full auto modes. Menus are easier to navigate than the 70D: five icons (reduced from the 70D's fifteen) and organized by category. If you've owned prior EOS models the interface will be familiar and you’ll barely need to crack the manual.The VIEWFINDER is a joy to use: bright and clear and with 100% coverage and .95x magnification an improvement over Rebels and the 70D. I love the transmissive LCD display (transparent LCD over the focusing screen) as it’s almost like using an EVF: display of icons AF and metering patterns grid and plain matte screens and an electronic level.AUTOFOCUS: The 45-point cross type AF array is fast and sure-footed in low light besting my 70D in most situations. It has the same AF modes as the 70D—single-point AF zone AF and automatic selection AF—plus a fourth mode large zone AF. I was surprised how much more “human aware” auto select mode is compared to the 70D. If a human enters the frame it locks on them like glue.LiveView has a new AF mode: AI Servo. Tap the subject on the touchscreen half-press the shutter button and it does a great job of tracking the subject across the screen. It’s perfect for low level shooting of moving critters or kids.IMAGES show pleasing detail color and impressive control of noise. Specifically there is a significant reduction in shadow noise over the 70D allowing aggressive lifting of shadows should the need arise.VIDEO: HD video quality is excellent: less moire artifacts cleaner in low light and smoother and more film-like compared to 70D files. I’m disappointed 4K HD wasn’t included. However 1080P is fine for YouTube since audiences mainly watch on phone and notebook screens.Movie servo is faster than 70D servo and less prone to “hunting” in low light. Focus-pulls are a snap with the touch screen. Movie servo with face recognition works great allowing me to both shoot and perform in video clips.WI-FI: Diddle settings fire shutter upload images and monitor LiveView and video on an iPhone/iPad Droid or computer with the Canon Connect app. Wi-Fi eats batteries crazy fast so carry spares. Video and LiveView are also available via wired USB or HDMI connection and are smoother and less battery draining.The 80D kit ships with the Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilization USM Lens (Black) lens. It’s a wonderful optic and I wrote a detailed review on it here.FINAL BURB: The 80D is a nimble and capable camera and an impressive upgrade over the 70D in terms of AF resolution and control of shadow noise. The bottom line is the many small improvements add up to an enjoyable experience and excellent images and videos.,1
DSLR Cameras,B01BUYK04A,Canon EOS 80D Digital SLR Camera Body…,"        43 of 47 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Camera for Shooting ""Filmic"" Video  April 9  2016By Tom",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This camera has come under a lot of criticism for its lack of 4K and I think that resentment trickled over into a lot of the venom being thrown at it in some online reviews.  I know it deterred me from purchasing it right away. But then I saw a glowing review on Chris and Jordan’s YouTube channel (TheCameraStoreTV) so I decided to take the plunge.  And I’m so glad I did.  This is a seriously amazing camera and a considerable improvement over its predecessor the 70D (which I owned).First the 4K issue.  I also own a Samsung NX1 which is more or less the gold standard in hyper-detailed 4K realism.  It’s a visually stunning image and it’s no exaggeration that you can see every single blade of grass in a lawn.  But while stunning it’s not “filmic.”  By that I mean we’re accustomed to a certain “look” and “feel” in movies.  Film flickers past at 24 frames per second; and if it’s shot at 30 frames per second (NTSC video rate) it feels “off” – the so-called “video” look.  The same goes for detail.  The hyper-detail in 4K cameras feels off cinematically.  A cinematic image needs to be focused; but if you’re seeing pores on a face (which 4K is more than capable of rendering) then the image is no longer pleasant.The footage from the 80D is pleasant  focused and cinematic.I also wanted to touch on the ALL-I codec.  The immediate default for filmmakers is to shoot “flat” and turn sharpness completely off.  The reasons for this are twofold – to reduce aliasing and moire artifacts; and historically in-camera sharpness was just ugly.That’s not the case with the 80D’s ALL-I recording codec which produces an impressive high-bitrate recording (I’ve heard it’s around 100 mbs).  Using ALL-I and with in-camera sharpness at 2 I put the camera through the ringer on everything I could find that produced aliasing and moire in every other camera I’ve owned (a bookshelf of DVD’s telephone wires brick walls etc.) and none of it resulted in aliasing or moire.  And the in-camera sharpness looks great!  It no longer has the harsh scrunched up contrast lines; the 80D’s sharpness looks better than anything you could do in post and still allows for a gentle falloff on highlights and shadows.As for the camera's dual-pixel auto focus it's everything you've read about it and more.  It really sets the gold standard for video auto focus.  It locks in smoothly and accurately without any back-and-forth ""hunting.""Anyway that’s my two cents.",0

May 10  2016By Thomas Phipps,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought the 80D as an upgrade from my 70D. There aren't that many upgrades but I wanted to give my adult daughter my 70D so I figured this would replace it plus give me more megapixels and the additional focus points which will come in handy for my [flying] bird photos.I absolutely love the articulated touch screen and wish my 5D Mark lll and my 5DS offered it as well. I do a fair amount of macro photography and often do multiple exposures for focus-stacking. The 80D like the 70D has rear screen magnification up to 10x plus a moveable focus square which is a real blessing when using the magnification features and manual focus. The moveable focus square will also go to the edges of the rear-screen image which is very useable when filling the frame with the subject image. I have no negatives to report on this camera or for that matter the 70D...,1

This camera comes with so many options that make your life easier in post production.  You can shoot time lapses slow motion etc.  People complain about no 4k but I don't care.  I'm not a filmmaker.  I'm a massage therapist that uses photos for my website marketing material and youtube vlogs.  This does the job perfectly.,0

I'm not a pro but was looking to move to a superior ""prosumer"" grade camera.  I wanted to find the right balance between cost and performance that offered a good value for my skill level.  This has been great so far and has great picture quality. The ability to rapidly shoot with little to no shutter delay has made all the difference when taking pictures of my small children and it is light enough to easily carry around all day while on vacation overseas. The controls are not intimidating and I'm looking forward to learning more about the many features the camera offers.",0

April 15  2016By ChicagoRunner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A very happy camper I am! I upgraded to the 80d from a 60d and am very satisfied with the new 80d. The additional functionality the 80 brings is amazing compared to the 60 and by the way I was very satisfied with the 60. The 45 focus points and the 7fps is what made the decision easy. I have been using the camera for about 3 weeks and am loving it the fast focus the tack sharp shots and the additional focus points are awesome. The internal wifi is great as well with the addition of the android app for viewing and use as a remote are great new features from the 60. I would highly recommend this upgrade if you are using a 60d or earlier canon!,0

December 31  2016By Shelly F,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Haven't used much yet because I need to micro adjust my lenses and haven't had time.  But I can say this far outranks my 7D for use in low light.  Very little grain when I used at 1600 ISO in low light.  I couldn't do that with my 7D or I would have to adjust the luminace to the point that nothing was sharp no matter what lenses I was using.  Also the CA seems less with this camera than with the 7D - I tried both with the same lens on a tripod at the same distance and focal length and the CA that the lens causes didn't seem as prominent with the 80D.  I think I am going to absolutely LOVE this camera!,0

Hansen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I just returned from a Rhine River Cruise and am ready to comment on the 70D. I've been a dedicated amateur for over 40 years and have been shooting with a 5DIII for the past two. I was intrigued with the real time auto focus and thought the 70D could replace my camcorder while traveling and maybe even the 5DIII. However I took both bodies and three lenses the 16-35 L IS 24-105 L IS and the 70-300 L IS. If you want a very technical review I would suggest; http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/. This is a great site for honest reviews.So here goes. Before leaving for Europe we took the grandkids to a fair with lots of rides. It was a sunny day with tons of light. The realtime auto focus worked perfectly. The video blew away my Canon XA10 but since the cam isn 't shooting through ""L"" glass that makes sense. I used the 24-105 L IS which became a 38-168 on the 70D. That's a great range for video. The lens focused quickly but quietly. The 16-35 L IS focuses faster but is very noisy making it a not great choice for video. The 70-300L IS is OK slightly noisy. In Europe I started out carrying both bodies the 5DIII with the 16-35 and the 70D with the 24-105. Great for quick shots without having to change lenses. The 16-35 was especially useful in those narrow streets with great architecture. On the 5DIII it's truly 16mm. On the 70D you would need a 10mm lens and they get very pricey. Comparing image quality isn't very fair since there's a big difference between the camera's in size and cost. The 70D's image is very good and if you weren't doing a direct comparison is more than acceptable. However the images on the 5DIII just ""pop"" even in Raw without tweaking. The color saturation especially the sky looks like there's a polarizer on. The 70D's are almost as good after some computer processing. All in all very impressive for that level of camera. Video was a mixed bag. In bright sunlight; awesome. In a ""lounge"" setting with low light some focus hunting and lots of grain. The superior ISO of the 5DIII really shows up here; but then it doesn't real time focus. A 5D with realtime auto focus would be the ticket!Bottom line: This is an incredible value. Unless you're a camera geek like me it will do just about everything you could want in a relatively compact inexpensive package. Stick on some ""L"" glass and you've got a winner.",0

I started using DSLR's mainly for videos on YouTube and dabbling in photography. Although I would say my Nikon was more user friendly for beginners- settings wise this was definitely the step up I needed. The main reason for making the switch was to find a camera that worked best for a one man show. The Canon 70D does everything for me and makes it that much easier. It's fast auto focus makes it easy to just hit record and start my video. I never have to ask myself ""am I in focus?"" or find myself surprised when I upload the footage into Sony Vegas. The flip out screen also helps in framing the shot by myself. Overall I upgraded to make my life easier when it came to filming and it did just that. If you are purchasing this camera for beginner photography I always recommend the T6i's to get to know the basics. But if you're willing to splurge a little I say hey why not. I love how quick the camera is in shooting photos and I never have to feel like i'm missing a shot. The LCD screen is also seamless and is very true to color.",1

Fleet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The bottom line is this is a fantastic vlogging camera which is the specific reason I bought it. If you're not interested in 4k if you're a 1 man band or just someone that wants to shoot a lot of great material and get it out to the world fast this might be the camera for you.Already being the owner of a Canon 5D mark iii and mark iv I am very familiar with the Canon brand. I do both still photography and videography equally.I endeavored to help my wife start up a lifestyle vlog and did a lot of research on cameras before picking this one. It made a lot of sense to me because I already own a lot of high-end Canon glass.  However owning full frame cameras I don't have too many super wide angle lenses that are better for this APC-S sized sensor. Please see below for a detailed analysis.VIDEOGRAPHY:Pros:-I love the articulating touch screen. To me this is the main reason this camera beats the pants off of my 5D's for shooting video. You can place this camera high or low left or right face it at you or behind you and turn the screen to see it. You can tap on the screen to focus or adjust properties easily.-Facial auto focus works really great! I know there is an upgraded camera (80D) that makes this better. But honestly if you are looking to save some money just get this camera. You're gonna be happy with the autofocus. It's fine.-Compared to my bigger cameras this guy is really light weight-The menus are easy to navigate-the footage looks amazing-Shoots 24p-Sound is straightforward. You need an off camera mic and you preferably want a powered mic so you can use the mic gain and not the camera's gain to get less hiss.-Can use any EF or EF-S lens.So you you are a canon shooter you've got a head start-Takes pretty nice photos too! Since I didn't buy this for photos admittedly I haven't delved in. I would truthfully use my 5D Mark IV for a photo shoot. But for me when I am out there shooting video if I want to snap a few stills this guy works great.Cons:-Not 4k (this is not a con for me but if you want 4k look elsewhere)-Not a high quality/high bit-depth format. (Again this is not a huge deal for me. I'm about story and speed over noodling with quality. I also own a BMPCC and yes shooting raw 10 or 12 bit is amazing... but you have to CC everything do online/offline workflows etc. so this is really more of a preference than a con. You have to know what you want to do. I think this camera wins for vlogging-Not as great with low light as other cameras.  This camera caps off at ISO 6400. But realistically you wanna be at 800 1600 max if you are good with seeing some noise.  On my Mark IV I can shoot at 6400 and see no visible noise. But I mean the Mark IV is like thousands of dollars more so it's not a great comparison.-Its not full frame. Not a huge problem neither was the Alexa I've shot TV shows on for years. But if you want full frame this ain't it. So you need wider aperture lenses or to shoot really long lens if you want to get shallow depth of field.LENSES:On lenses I did pick it up with the 18-55mm kit lens then also bought the little 2.8 24mm pancake lens.  They're both great lenses actually... for the cost.  The 18-55 has stabilization so is better for hand held stuff but needs more light. The 24mm makes the camera super light to carry and also looks nice at 2.8.  Both of these lenses autofocus great with the camera.So I disagree with some reviews out there that say don't get the kit lens. These days canon makes them pretty good and they are cheap in comparison to other lenses. So unless you have all the glass you need - get the kit lens.  I usually get the short zoom kit lens because they are sharper and faster.Having used this camera for a few weeks I really want to get something wider like the canon 10-22 or the sigma equivalent. I think there are times when being at a 10 to 14mm especially out doors would be helpful.  I have not used either of these two lenses my widest lens that is not a fisheye is the canon 15mm zoom.CONCLUSION:This camera may be on the older side right now but I have to tell you I like it better for videography than my Mark IV. it's just so much faster and easier to use and doesn't make you're wrist feel like it is going to break off. And because it is older you can get it cheaper.Don't let all the posts and videos about technical quality hold you back from just going out there and creating. At the end of the day it's about your talent and your stories. Tell them. I've seen big TV shows with Alexa's suck. I've seem people do amazing things with iPhones. It's not the cameras its you and how you use them.So if you're gonna go tell stories and you have about $1200 bucks to do so get this camera the kit lens and an on camera mic. That's all you need. I promise you.,0

January 26  2016By Jones Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am in Love with this Camera!!! I was given this Canon camera as a Christmas gift from my husband.  I have never had a SLR camera before.  My camera that I was using was a digital that I first got when digital was the new thing.  So this was quite the upgrade for me!!!  I was very intimidated at first not knowing if I would be able to use it or not. I can honestly say that if you know how to read instructions then just reading the instruction manual can really get you up and going.  Just off of reading the instruction manual I was able to learn how to make the camera basically a point and shoot camera along with also being able to figure out how to start to use some special effects with the camera still auto focusing itself.The camera also takes videos and this was very simple to figure out how to do.  It has lots of different modes and tons of options if you are camera savvy and know what you are doing to make some quality photos.  When my husband wanted to get me a camera for Christmas he did tons of research.  He is a computer guy so research is really his thing.  He found this to be the best option out there for someone who is new to learning an SLR along with being one of the most sought after cameras from those who are well experienced with SLR cameras.  So whether you are new to SLR or a pro the photos I have seem come out of this camera are amazing.  I will attach just a few of the photos this newbie took in my first week of learning this camera.It is a very pricey camera at $1200 but if you can swing the cost it is well worth it and I would highly recommend this camera!!!!!,1

Well that's true but the audio is filled with the infamous audio background hiss.  The shotgun mic it comes with doesn't have a setting to limit sound input to +20 or +40 dB.  So basically the mic is not much better than the built-in camera mic.The picture quality is very high-quality as is the video quality.  The audio is a deal-breaker though.

Anderson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have a love hate relationship with this camera. I've been shooting with it for about 5 months now and it has the ability to take amazing photographs. Previously I had been shooting with a lower end Rebel that my brother gave me and I upgraded to this because the Rebel was limiting me creatively and technically. Specifically I wanted more auto focus points to allow me to compose the images in ways which the Rebel's 9 point focus system wouldn't allow. I mainly use a 50mm 1.8 II the 70-200 2.8 L  and a 100mm Macro 2.8 L IS. Sometimes the 85mm 1.8 USM. The biggest downfall of this camera in my experience is that it has a severe consistency issue with it's auto focus. I take photos which based upon the lighting conditions and the settings should produce sharp photos. Sometimes they are absolutely tack sharp and amazing. And the other half of the time it is (usually) front focusing. If it was consistent one way or another I could make micro adjustments but since it is so inconsistent if I micro adjust it will just have the same problem on the other half of the photos. It happens wide open and even on higher apertures and It makes me very frustrated!! It ends up wasting my time due to the volume of photos I have to take and sort through to pick out the usable images.If I were able to go back in time I would have just spent the extra money and went for the 5D Mark III which is what I wish I had right now.I love the layout the build and build quality and all the functionality of the 70 D except for this auto focus consistency issue. It make me miss the perfect facial expressions that flicker just once and are just enough out of focus when I pull it up in lightroom to render the photo useless. I end up having to take many more photos than I normally would just so I can be sure I have some in focus for my clients.At first I chalked it up to my inexperience as a semi-pro photographer but I'm confident now as others have had this same issue that it is a problem with the system not me. Perhaps its only some of the camera bodies and I was one of the unlucky ones but it's very frustrating.I will attach some photos that show my love of this camera though because when it nails it it really nails it! It can produce some amazing simply stunning photos. (most of these were taken with my 50mm 1.8 II STM),1

DSLR Cameras,B00DMS0GTC,Canon EOS 70D Digital SLR Camera (Body…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Fantastic Camera for Video Production  October 13  2016By Tangible Productions,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,For full context I run a small video production company and we now primarily shoot on the Canon 70D. While I do use the photo functionality of the 70D every once in a while I use these primarily for video so that's what my review will be focused on.I've shot with a Canon 70D for a little over a year now. About 6 months after buying my first 70D I bought a second one. My 70Ds have essentially replaced my two previous cameras each from the lower-level Canon Rebel line (a T2i and a T3i). When switching over from a Rebel to the 70D I noticed an immediate difference in picture quality. While the 70D and Rebels shoot at the same resolution the 70D offers a number of different codecs to shoot in which can greatly affect your video quality.The biggest advantage of the 70D over the Rebels is the autofocus. I'd owned the T2i and T3i for the better part of 5 years before switching to the 70D and had never used autofocus while recording on the Rebels (it was atrocious). I was used to focusing by hand which is fine and dandy for most shots (usually when locked down on a tripod) but can make others (handheld slider dolly) incredibly difficult to maintain focus. The 70D changed that. I started using the autofocus on a couple L lenses whenever I was shooting which helped guarantee I'd never end up with a shot out of focus. This was especially helpful when shooting on a jib since I couldn't keep my hands around the focus ring when the camera is kept 8 feet away. Being able to trust the tracking/autofocus has made my life a lot easier as a camera operator. Whenever I'm using a lens without AF (like a cine lens) I really do find myself missing the autofocus of the other lenses.I don't plan on upgrading from a 70D to a 5D IV anytime soon for two reasons - first obviously the 5D IV is far more expensive than the 70D (it currently costs about 250% more than the 70D) but the bigger reason that I'm not planning on upgrading is the fact that the 70D (as well as any Rebel post-T3i) has an articulating screen and the 5D IV does not. I use the screen on the 70D too much to settle for one that's permanently inset into the back of my camera. And while yes an external HDMI monitor can essentially fix this I do enough run-and-gun shooting that I don't often want to deal with bringing along a monitor setting it up keeping its batteries charged etc. Yet I do need to be able to see my shot even when my camera's backed up against a wall or set up high enough to shoot over a crowd which is when the articulating screen really comes in handy.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        197 of 204 people found the following review helpful       The D500 is great (disregard nay-sayers)  May 4  2016By R. Yamada,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"First of all I didn't buy this camera on Amazon. I bought it elsewhere because I knew I could get it faster there (proof of purchase in pics). Secondly all of the negative reviews I read so far should be disregarded or better yet deleted. I don't care if it's ""just an opinion."" If you're misrepresenting the strengths of this camera because it won't connect with your iOS device or because it's not a FX body than keep it to yourself. People want true reviews not crybaby reviews over non-issues.Snapbridge is delayed on iOS. There is no false advertising. It was announced at the initial launch that a delay was happening for iOS. This is also Nikon's first DX flagship in almost a decade. A lot of folks who held on to the still relevant D300S have been asking for this and now we have it. Some people rather have a DX body for their type of shooting if you're complaining that Nikon didn't release another (ANOTHER) FX body the D500 is obviously not for you.Speaking on the FX/DX debate true actual owners of the D500 should already know that the D500 really closed that difference gap. The overall imagery is great. The noise handling is surprisingly on-par with some FX bodies like the D750 and all the nerd tests from DPR show that in some settings the D500 is beating the D5 in handling ISO and maintaining a clean sharp image.The D500 (for those not in the know) is aimed at sports and wildlife photographers and it's impressive in that regard but I found it equally impressive in FX-related photography like landscape (I shoot LE astrophotography) and portraits. The Auto AF Fine-Tune is invaluable quick and easy to use. The new tilt screen (it's a new version from the D750) is rigid and tough. The touchscreen is accurate and intuitive. The inclusion of an XQD slot makes this wicked fast. I was able to clear the 200 shot  buffer without any slowdown  with the Lexar Pro x2933 at 14-bit RAW and the photos finished loading the 200 shots to the card anywhere between 7 - 10 seconds. the OVF is 100% coverage and is bright. I was able to tack-sharp focus a star with just the viewfinder. Overall the images are nice and sharp BUT at times they're not as sharp as a D7200 or my D7100. You can thank the 20mp sensor for that (compared to the 24mp sensor in the D7100/7200).EDIT (8/20): Since somebody else had to exclaim that I was wrong about IQ differences between the 71/7200 (7100 mainly) and the D500 in their review perhaps some clarifying is in order. Yes the D500 performs in this department well at higher ISOs than the D7100. That doesn't mean that the D500 is the end-all winner. I've compared landscape dusk shots I've taken with my D7100 and then with the D500. I also have a 4k monitor which is a pixel-peepers dream. As much as I hate pixel peeping a number of the shots I've taken on the D7100 were overall better than the same shots I took with the D500. I guess I should say that at times and certain conditions the D500 has better IQ but at other times it's just not.... imo. In any case I don't care too much about that because I work with the gear that I got and I hold onto said gear for as long as I can. I make sure my fundamentals are in order I exercise what I learned The D7100 was an anomaly purchase because some of us have been waiting for a D300S replacement for years.. I mean I still shoot film with my old F3 and FE and push film. Fundamentals>Gear. Despite that this whole image deal is really only an issue with people who obsessed with pixel peeping and doesn't embrace imperfections such as noise.Overall wildlife photos are still sharp and the photos are still good enough for decent sized prints. The 4k is detailed and the 1080p recording is combo'd with Electronic VR which works pretty decent.My only two issues with this camera is the additional crop-factor you get when filming in 4K. It is doable since it's pretty much the same crop as MFT sensors but I prefer a wide lens for 4k filming. The other issue is battery. It sucks up way more battery life than the D7100/D7200. Even with Airplane Mode on the camera seems to suck battery life at a faster rate than my previous bodies. Also for now if you need an extra battery you have to buy legit EN-EL15s because none of the 3rd party batteries work.This is a GREAT camera. Well worth the wait. Go with what kind of photography you mostly shoot with and get the gear you think works best for you. Don't play trial and error with your money and then cry and needlessly give a good camera bad reviews.",1

April 26  2016By Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,As usual my background so you can calibrate what your read.A long time Nikon user since 70s currently using a D810 D600 and D7100 to be replaced by the new D500.  I shoot Wildlife both in the wild  and in the streets.Now about this Camera.  I will divide it to 3 parts.  Image quality Usability and software/wireless connectivity.From the quick few days I can tell you that It is better than D7100  I skipped the D7200 since the Rumor was that this was coming.I tested the D500 against D7100 for ISO and general IQ performance.  I would say If you are getting this camera to get improved IQ over D7100 or D7200 then you are not going to be that happy.  You will not get $1000 better IQ from D500.  This Camera is not about the IQ/sensor but it is all about usability handling and build quality.This Camera is a Handling beast.  It is all about handling and usability not about ISO or IQ.  With 10 FPS Huge Buffer and an AF system that is much better than D810.  If you had a D700/D800/D810 this camera is similar in layout and but Light years a head in ergonomics and Handling. I hold judgement on Build quality being better than D700/D800/D810.It is lighter and feels like it is smaller than D810.  All the changes are for the better. I thought the grip on D810 was great. But now I know how much better it could have been.  The Joystick is a joy to use and if you are a back button AF-on user then you will be in heaven.  We get D5 class treatment here.  The Joystick not only moves the AF point around and is much more comfortable to use but it also can activate the AF with a press just like the AF-on button.  Why is that a good thing? Well because you can assign different AF mode to it.  By assigning different AF mode to each button you can go back and forth between 2 different  modes by just picking the button that activates the mode you want.  So If you do Birds in flight and use Group AF or Auto Area AF using your AF-on button.  But like to use single point AF when the birds land to get  sharp eyes. All you have to do is to assign single point AF to the Joystick push button and use it.  No more 2 handed Camera juggling with long lenses to change the AF mode.  There is several improvements like this that has been added.The Articulating display is another welcome addition.  The relocation of the ISO button is great but it seems to me that they have removed the Easy ISO capability (ability to use one of the command wheels to change ISO quickly).  Assuming that since now we can change ISO with one hand you don't need it but why remove it.  It is a mystery to me perhaps above my pay grade.  Fortunately they kept the Easy Exposure Comp capability.The play back of images is so fast that you can take a burst of a 100 or so images and then play them back like a movie by holding the direction button.  Silly to do but fun.All in all this is one hell of camera and great value at this price.  As I said buy this camera only if you need the handling usability and build quality.since after all this is a crop sensor body and IQ will never be better than a full sensor body of the same era.Now about the Software and Wireless.  It is there and not very impressive ... enough said.Snap-bridge is not available for iPhone but fortunately we had an Android phone in the family to use to test it.  Surprisingly it is stable and works. But the APP is lame and will do very little tethering functions.  Otherwise if you are using your D500 to take a snap of your dinner and post it to the face book you are in luck.  Other than that I am sure Nikon has plans but knowing their history with software I am sure it will be discontinued and replace by something else soon.  eh...Now an odd thing.  The first 2 batteries drained quickly.  I was expecting the first one since Nikon uses a builtin battery for internal clock and usually it gets it's charge from your battery the first time you use the camera.  But this thing kept draining the batteries.  So a bit of digging showed that all the wireless capabilities are on.  WiFi BT NF etc.  There is a Airplane mode but it is set to off by default. Why? Don't know.  Perhaps again above my pay grade. I turned all that junk off and it seems all is well.  But last time I thought all was well I ended up sending my D800 back to Nikon after 3 weeks of getting it.  I am hopeful for both our's and Nikon's sake.Hope this help some of you like me who were waiting for a D810 with Crop sensor for wildlife and sports shooting and were willing to pay the same price as a D810 as I was.  We got all we wanted and then some for 1/3 less than what we were expecting to pay.Nikon please bring back the Easy ISO... pretty please.MikeUpdate 4-28-2016:Good news Bad newsGood news the battery consumption issue is a none issue.  The AF is wicked good The buffer is limitless for all practical purposes. 60+ shots of large Raw+JPEGs high quality using Sony XQD G cards.  We will be going broke buying hard drives. The AF and the buffer alone is worth the extra $1000 for anyone who needs them.The bad news I found out during the battery consumption testing that none of the after market batteries will work with this camera.  Do not buy after market batteries with this camera. I tried 3 different brands of high quality batteries that I have been using with my D810/D600/D7100 and all had worked like a charm but none of them works with D500 at all.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        124 of 132 people found the following review helpful       So far this looks like an excellent camera  April 27  2016By Michael Willis,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"As an amateur wildlife photographer so far I'm happy with this camera. I've only had one late afternoon of shooting Ospreys with it (EDIT: see updates below) and it was very impressive. Auto-focus is extremely fast and the 10 frame-per-second shooting with a massive buffer is unbelievable. I'm using just an SD card (high speed) and I get 26 shots in the buffer (EDIT: in practice I'm getting about a 30 shot burst).My ratio of good shots to bad shots is already significantly higher than it was with my Canon EOS 70D which is a great camera but not nearly as good at focusing as this one is. I took about 400 images today and there may have been 10 that were too blurry to make use of and that includes a moment when an Osprey took me by surprise and I had to aim and shoot in about a second. The D500 picked up the bird and focused almost instantly.The shots are a bit softer than I hoped for but I haven't used the automatic focus fine-tuning yet. I was using my (also new) Sigma 150-600mm Sport which is a good lens but I haven't used Sigma's USB dock to fine tune it yet. So I (optimistically) suspect that when I use the camera's auto-tune and then use Sigma's dock to push it even further I'll get razor sharp images almost every time. I'm very impressed so far this is a big step up from the 70D where I would get roughly 10 or 15 bad shots for every good one. Not knocking the 70D I'm not a professional so I'm sure I have room for improvement.I'm also extremely happy with Snapbridge mainly because it easily connected to my Android phone (NFC didn't work but bluetooth paired easily - I've never had much luck with NFC). Snapbridge is now automatically geotagging every image. That's a big part of why I got this camera - I travel all over the world and geotagging has become a necessity as far as I'm concerned. Here's a knock on Canon - before switching to this Nikon I purchased Canon's latest - the 80D. Not only was the 80D unable to connect to my Android (only worked on Android 5 and I was on 6 which has been out for months) but when connecting to other Android 5 devices it was unable to automatically geotag images. After speaking to Canon support they said it was a limitation of the camera and suggested I grab Canon's GPS add-on unit. Unacceptable when almost everyone has a smartphone that has GPS capabilities these days.Some other quick notes both pros and cons:- The shutter release button is kind of ""soft"" meaning even when I don't want to I frequently accidentally get a burst of 10 shots when I meant to take just 1. Not a big deal I'm getting used to it already.- The touch screen LCD is great but I was surprised to find that it's not ""always"" touch-sensitive. For example navigating the settings menus is not touch-enabled at all. Not a big deal but I was surprised.- The swiveling LCD screen is good but Canon's fully articulating screen on the 70D and 80D is better. I particularly liked that on those cameras I could turn the LCD around entirely facing inward protecting the screen from scratches. I already bought a glass screen protector for the D500 so it's kind of a moot point.- By default the camera shows the remaining exposure count in the viewfinder and the top-display. If you want to see ISO instead you can but it shows up in place of the exposure count. So basically you have to choose between one or the other. For me I went with ISO.That's it for now I'll continue to update this review as I get more experience with the camera especially after doing some fine-tuning on both the camera and the lens.UPDATE: 5/1/2016I spent a couple of hours playing with the auto AF-tune option using both the bundled Nikon 16-80mm lens and my Sigma 150-600 (which is not an easy candidate for tuning). The system works generally OK but repeated attempts give different results sometimes with wide variations. The Nikon usually got a -1 0 or +1 so I left it at 0. The Sigma was a lot tougher due to how large of a zoom range it has and different distances between myself and the subject. I'll have to use Sigma's USB dock for this but to speed things up I decided on a +3 (manual) adjustment after getting varying readings from the auto adjustment system (from -5 up to +6). I don't think it's the camera's fault the lens has so many ranges and subject distances that one value will never be enough.I spent another day shooting mostly birds and got some shots I'm very happy with. Success rate is still very high and mistakes have always been my fault. For example I got some motion blur due to not using a high enough ISO setting (and therefore slower shutter speed) a few times on an egret (photos attached). I went up to 5000 ISO yesterday and used Lightroom for noise reduction which I was happy with. This was in bright sunlight but handheld at long range on subjects in motion so I needed fast shutter speeds. I attached more photos here with 100% crops as well (although Amazon may shrink those a bit I'm not sure). More mistakes on my part I forgot to switch the camera to AF-S for a squirrel and a turtle both of which weren't moving and didn't need AF-C / 153. However the pictures came out great anyway.UPDATE: 5/8/2016Took the camera to a farm animal event nearby today for more practice. Still a very good success ratio. I noticed something weird with Snapbridge. After connecting and putting my phone in my pocket maybe 10 minutes later I would check and it would show no connection and the camera would say awaiting connection. I would reconnect and put the phone back in my pocket and 10 minutes later it would seem to be disconnected. I got annoyed and figured geotagging would be lost for many images but upon importing all geotagging was there. Not sure what the deal is but I was glad to not lose geotagging.I also made use of the bundled 16-80mm lens paired with a Canon 500D close-up lens today (using a 77mm - 72mm adapter). Everything worked perfectly fine and I'm happy with the lens.As always I believe any issues with the pictures are on my end. For example a decent close-up of a fly using manual focus was focused on his lower body instead of his eyes. Hard to tell when looking through the viewfinder I should have taken some test shots and then reviewed them at 100% in the LCD and re-adjusted. All close-ups were taken at f/8 but I should have tried for a better depth of field at maybe f/22 or something.Adding more sample pics my apologies if you're grossed out by bugs!",1
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        19 of 19 people found the following review helpful       All-around great camera and amazing DX camera in low-light situations  July 28  2016By Brian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The Nikon D500 is an awesome DSLR. Being a DX camera I was a little concerned about the low-light performance of the sensor -- the 1.5x crop factor has never bothered me. However the D500 is incredible at outside night and also inside with little lighting. I get usable high-quality low-noise images at 10000 ISO with a little help of noise reduction in Adobe Lightroom. If I'm just using a photo to post to Instagram or other low-quality image platforms I can easily use an image shot at 25600 ISO. After traveling to Paris and Rome and watching the Bastille Day fireworks at night and visiting museums with less-than-ideal lighting for photography I am completely impressed with the camera's ability to function in varying lighting conditions.The autofocus system on the camera is also unbelievable. I often shoot in single-point AF but when I've used the continuous 3D AF tracking for my dogs or moving subjects it rarely does not capture them in focus. Coupled with the maximum 10 frames per second it's hard not to get the shot you wanted for subjects in motion.The build quality of the D500 is also superb. It feels sturdy but not ridiculously heavy or overdone. The placement of buttons (like ISO focus point knob etc.) are very intuitive and natural to use. To be honest I don't really use the touchscreen except to zoom in on image previews. Even when scrolling through images I still naturally use the button because the touchscreen scrolls in the opposite direction of an iPhone (if you swipe left on the D500 it scrolls back whereas on the iPhone it scrolls forward...this is just my personal preference). Also being an iOS user it's a bit annoying that the SnapBridge app and functionality on the camera is still not available -- although it is available for Android users.Other than those small insignificant things I really have nothing negative to say about the D500. Moreover the D750 (a full-frame camera) is similarly priced but you do not get the features that the D500 packs. If if you want the full-frame equivalent of the D500 -- the D5 -- you would have to shell out another $4500 on top of the D500's $2000 price tag.If crop factor is not an issue for you then the Nikon D500 is the perfect camera for someone who is either an enthusiast or semi-professional.Hope this helps.,1
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        25 of 26 people found the following review helpful       This years best DSLR.  May 7  2016By Chris Winter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Lets start off this review by taking a look at the build quality of the Nikon D500.The first thing you feel when you pick up the D500 is just how big it is. But to me that’s not a bad thing at all.It feels incredibly solid and moulds to your hand really quite well. It’s not actually as heavy as you’d think and is on par to something like the 7d mark ii.To me the D500 has some of the best button placement that I’ve seen on on a Nikon body. Everything is where you’d expect to find it with your record iso and exposed compensation buttons up the top here near the shutter button.On the side we’ve got a number of different ports but we’ll talk more about them later on.There isn’t an inbuilt flash on the d500 and a few poepl might miss it but for me on a pro body like this it’s not a big deal.As you’d expect for a camera of this calibre the d500 is weather sealed so you’re going to have no problems taking this out in the rain.So overall in terms of build quality the d500 is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.-Let’s turn the camera around now and take a look at the lcd screen on the back.And something new and probably unexpected is that nikon have included an articulating screen on the d500.Now to be fair it’s not a full articulating screen like you find on cameras such as the canon 80d but it is pretty useful still.You can flip it up and down which has been really useful for composing my shots.It does feel pretty solid but i do worry a little bit about the hinge its on. It doesn’t seem pretty thin so it’ll be interesting to see just how well it holds up.Photos from the the 20 megapixel sensor look really great on the back of the screen even in bright daylight.Other than that though the screen is very bright and sharp. I’ve been seeing this trend lately with Nikon producing some really good screens and the d500 continues with it as well.-One feature I love on the Nikon D500 and one that’s a bit of a life saver is not eh side here that’s it dual card slots.This might not seem like a big feature but having the ability to back up your photos is huge especially if you’re shooting important one time events like weddings.To me this should be a given in any pro level body but it is still nice to see.-The viewfinder on the D500 has 100% coverage as you’d expect as was nice to use.If you’re coming from a lower end nikon body the shipe of it is a little different but with it’s 1x magnification it works very quite well.-Let’s talk quickly about the menus on the D500.If you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR you’ll feel right at home using the D500. The menus are pretty feature packed with a lot of different options especially once you move into full manual mode.Performance was quick though and there was no lag which is good.-So i just wanted to touch on the battery life of the d500.I’ve been incredibly impressed with the battery life of this camera although I would recommend using a battery grip if you are going to shooting photos all day or shooting 4k video.I got through about 1200 shots before the battery ran out on me.But overall the battery life was very good on the nikon d500.-So let’s talk about the burst rate of the nikon d500.Now Nikon are touting this camera as being a real winner for sports and i’ve got to say it lives up to the hype.The d500 can shoot at an impressive 10 frames per second which should be fast enough for most sports and wildlife.Just for reference sake this is what 10 frames per second sounds like.This puts it on par with it’s biggest rival the Canon 7d mark ii which can also shoot at around 10 frames per second.I also found that the D500’s autofocus was incredible. Nikon have really upped their game and to me the autofocus on the d500 is some of the best i’ve ever tested.You’ve also got a 200 raw shot buffer which is very nice.I’m going to be making a more in depth video on the autofocus of the d500 so check back soon for that but overall it’s blisteringly fast.-Now I briefly touch on the ports on the camera earlier on but i just wanted to show you what you get. Of course you’re getting a usb and an cdmi cable but also in the middle hear you getting a mic and headphone jack.This to me shows that nikon are really trying to convince more video shooters over to their side and it’s good to see.Havin gate ability to record good sound and monitor as well is really important and makes this a pretty impressive little video camera which we’ll talk about a little bit more now.-So let’s talk more about the Nikon D500 for video.As you probably know if you’re watching this video the D500 can shoot 4k video. And i’ve got to say it’s incredibly impressive.The colours it reproduces are very nice and the detail is definitely there.Compred to something like the Canon 7d mark ii the sharpness of the 4k to the 1080p really is night and day.Now one few drawback of the nikon d500 though is that it does crop the video quite a lot when shooting 4k. So if you do know you’re going to be wanting to shoot in 4k you’ll want to make sure you have a wide enough lens.One other nice thing is that the d500 can shoot a full 30 minutes of video cpmapred to just 3 minutes on the more expensive nikon d5. To me that’s a pretty big deal and something to consider if you are choosing between the two.One other nice feature is that you can create timelapses in the camera which is a lot of fun and something that again emphasizes that Nikon is really trying to gain a bit more marketshare in the video market.SO overall the Nikon d500 is actually a pretty capable video shooting machine so good job nikon.-So i just quickly wanted to talk about wifi.The d500 comes with wifi and nfc included which is great if you want to be able to quickly transfer your photos to your phone.This is something that the 7d mark ii misses out on so again is something to consider.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        15 of 15 people found the following review helpful       A Fantastic Investment  June 26  2016By David William Sargent Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I will update at the top of this review when I feel I may need to.UPDATE:A couple months in and the camera still kicks ass. If you're thinking about it just do it.----------------------------------Alright so I've had the camera for almost two weeks now.I've shot probably half a dozen different landscape scenes. A couple portrait shoots and lots of lowlight material. I'm fascinated with the Milky Way for night sky photography and this camera powers through it very nicely. ISO 1600 through 3200 looking very clean in comparison to the old D5300. I'd say close to full frame performance in regards to high ISO noise handling. Dynamic range is absolutely phenomenal. I'm able to pull up lots of detail out of shadows and pull down the highlights very nicely when needed. No problems at all yet with battery life - In fact I got about 950 shots on an 85% charge in a timelapse so I'd say it's right on the money. Also have had no issues with the Lexar XQD with this camera like others have reported. I am having some issues with Lightroom taking FOREVER to import these photos when connected via the USB. For most shots I just transfer to the SD card and use my card reader but for some things I have to use the USB to transfer direct from the camera and Lightroom (CC updated and D500 Firmware updated) and it seriously takes probably 3 or 4 hours to import 8 or 10 gigs in. Wondering what might be the issue there but outside of that I have no complaints. This camera has proved its worth nicely.The illuminated buttons have also been a blessing for my night sky shooting.----------So far I have nothing but love for this camera. I'm coming from a history of low-mid level cameras so this jump was significant for me. Most recently I'm coming from a Nikon D5300. The pro features I were expecting are truly great. The button layout is much more than a gimmick. Having the ISO button on the right side thereby freeing my left hand at times is such a practical and appreciated decision by Nikon.The touch screen is nice for what functionality it has. I was hoping to be able to use it in more of the menu side of things but I'm not taking away a star for that. That wouldn't change the quality of my images.The focusing is everything you've probably heard about. It's crazy. It's so fast and so so accurate. I haven't even had a chance to use 3D tracking yet but its normal continuous focus really works incredibly well.The ISO to noise ratio is incredibly well controlled. As a landscape photographer I have low tolerance for noise especially with astrophotography. I was always looking for ways to reduce noise in post because the lower tier cameras just can't handle it well. I was testing some of that out with the D500 but on a sunny evening/sunset and I shot some images in ISO ranges I never thought I would call acceptable. I'm talking ISO 25000 with just a little bit of noise reduction in lightroom and I wouldn't have an issue posting to social media. Even 52000 wasn't out of the realm of possibilities if I were in a pinch. That is absolutely insane to know that I can say that now but this camera is just that good in that regard. I haven't had the chance to do astro with it yet and test out the high-iso in low light conditions but I got the camera on a full moon so in a week or two will have some results to show for that.The LCD screen resolution is nice and bright and clear and the viewfinder is very nice. I especially like the round eyepiece. The button illumination is awesome and will really come in handy for us astrophotographers. It really feels like a pro body that got the attention to detail it deserves.The processor is so blazingly fast. I have it set up to save RAW files to the XQD (Been using Lexar with no issues) and Jpegs to the SD with snapbridge sending 2mb copies to my phone for quick Snapseed edits going out to Instagram in no time.The battery life is great. The camera shipped with the newer version of the ENEL15 battery and I have seen very good performance out of it so far.The camera itself is bigger and heavier than my D5300 but the grip is deep and offsets that extra mass as it's easy to hold.I have not tested out the video yet so I'll be sure to do that upon updating my review.(Be aware that I shot my first batch of uploaded pictures with the Nikkor 18-135 f/3.5 so if I had sharper glass I would have sharper images),1

DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        10 of 10 people found the following review helpful       Great crop sensor camera.  May 12  2016By Marc R. Feldesman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I haven't been disappointed a bit by the camera which joins two D810s and a Sony A6300 in the collection.  I bought the camera FOR the crop to get some extra apparent distance from my longer lenses got fast moving sports and for the occasion BIF.  I brought it with me from the US to the UK to put it through its paces.  So far focus acquit ion has been super fast. Buffer and buffer depth allow me to shoot 30-40 raws without the buffer filling.  While some have reported miscellaneous problems the QA on ine has been superb.  I use Lexar 2933x XQD cards and either Lexar UHSII 2000x or Sandisk 280 Mbit/sec cards.  I don't miss the flash; throw on an nexpensive SB500 and away you go.  I've now shot about 1500 images and while not all are keepers the number of potential keepers is high.  Great autofus system.  Highly recommended.  It is NOT full frame and don't buy it expecting full-frame.  Expect some of this technology to show up in the replacement for the D810.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01A7Q0J3Y,Nikon D500 DX-Format Digital SLR (Body…,        24 of 26 people found the following review helpful       A rugged work-horse  May 15  2016By anonymous,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Been shooting with this camera for about 12 days. It's a rugged work-horse like the D300 it's fast - and fast to focus (if it's not focusing fast - check your setting) and excellent in low light conditions but in bright light conditions images can be a bit washed out. Also shooting a D810 and I've read reviews that make the claim that the images are just as good as the D810 but I have to disagree here. Tested both cameras against each other shooting with the same settings lens & conditions and the D810 is the clear winner when it comes to image quality with that said the D500 is close behind. If you are used to looking at D810 images you will notice the difference in image quality between them. The D500 is a nice compliment to the D810 and it fits my need for shooting birds in low light conditions.  Images shot at ISO 4000 F5.6 speeds between 2500-8000.  Only cropped & brighten.  This is not a noiseless camera it still produces noise at high ISOs but much less then the majority of cameras out there and the details at high ISOs are extremely good.  Watch Tony Northrup's review & comparison of the D500 on YouTube to help put this in perspective.,1

May 15  2016By Karen C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought my D300 back in 2008 and I paid 2k for it. It was a great camera but I had to sell it because the expected replacement ( D400 ) was never made by Nikon so I decided to go with FX and I bought the D750.When this camera D500 was announced I decided to buy it right away and I do not regret. I am paying for it the same price I paid for my beloved D300 but this one is way better than my D300.Excellent AF system excellent frame rate are just some of the positive things about this camera. The most important things for me is the AF system which is superb. Once you lock on your subject it won't fail as far as you continue keeping your focus point on the subject as it moves. It does not matter if you are using d25 d72 Group or 3D tracking it will continue focusing at 10fps and it won't fail at all. You will have more keepers than not. It does not matter if something is in front or back of your subject the camera will continue focusing on your subject rather than being fooled by things around your subject. It is simple amazing and it is very fun to use.You can also use this camera for low light photography. Personally I will not use it above ISO 6400 but that way above the ISO that you could use with the D300 or any other DX camera in the market today. The camera feels secure in your hand and you have the feeling that you are in control all the time. Even though we are missing the U1 and U2 I still give it a 5 stars review. I do recommend it to whoever want to have the best DX camera out there.,0

July 29  2016By real review!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I ordered this one because it was cheaper than getting it brand new. I purchased the option for express shipping ($14) and it said it was going to come on Monday because I ordered it on a Thursday(the 28th). It came the very next day! I was a little worried that it wasn't going to look brand new but I was wrong. Everything was wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap so nothing got damaged. It looked as if I paid for a brand new one. All of the items were there and I immediately put it together and turned it on. No problems at all that I can see at the moment. The only thing I don't like is the strap. It doesn't seem like it'll last long so I'll just buy a better thicker one. But overall  Im happy about this purchase! Now all I have to do is buy extra batteries more cards a better strap and a durable bag.,0

It was released in 2014.  It has an optical viewfinder for pictures but not video.  The 3"" LCD panel on the back affixed to the camera is used for video and can be used for pictures.  The optical viewfinder is blocked when the LCD panel is used because the mirror is lifted. This kit from Canon comes with both a18-55 mm and a 75-300 mm auto focus Canon lens plus a case.  These lenses provide the equivalent range of 29 mm to 480 mm with the APS-C image sensor providing a 0.6 wide angle to 9.6 telephoto range.  The 18x55 lens has image stability (IS) built in.  The camera can be used like a point and shoot camera or used in a totally manual/professional  mode with all settings controlled by the user.  The 18 Mpixel  APS image sensor provides very high quality pictures and full 1080 video.  I am very pleased with the camera kit.  I have only had this camera for two months but used a Canon AE1 film SLR for many years.",0

I love the fact that it can be used it auto mode or manual. I use the manual mode while my wife likes the auto. Picture quality is fantastic and because of the high resulution enlargements retain the clarity. I have received compliments on some of the pictures the short time I have had it. Great camera for the budding photographer or someone whose hobby is taking pictures and does not want to spend alot of money.,1

This is my first camera that is not a point-and-shoot and it's great especially for the price.  The lens that comes with it is also pretty darn good.  The automatic settings do a really good job of picking shutter speeds f stops and white balances for great photos.  I also really like the aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings.  The shutter speed priority setting is especially useful for taking photos when motion is an issue such as from a moving vehicle.  lso there is a great feature in some modes that allows you to set 3 exposure levels and take 3 photos at different exposures.  Doing this is not very intuitive though and takes some manual reading.I do wish that this camera could take photos in aspect ratios other than 3:2 but that's all it can do.  There is no panorama setting either.Overall a very good camera as a first DSLR.  A huge upgrade from point and shoot.,0

I loved my Canon Rebel XSi of years ago as well.  I really haven't had a Canon dSLR that I haven't loved!  I purchased the T5 for my daughter to use who has to take photography as a restricted elective for her graphic design degree.  I didn't feel generous enough to share my 70D!  :)  The price of the T5 is right but after re-visiting the specs we've decided to exchange it for a T5i since it's likely going to become my back-up camera and I realized the T5 doesn't have spot-metering and the ISO tops out at 6000-ish.  I'm still a Canon fan though!  I think for most beginners the extra $250 for the T5i would be a waste...I'm just an old pro and very picky.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00RUBJ7EW,Nikon D5500 DX-format Digital SLR Body…,        112 of 117 people found the following review helpful       The Camera I've Been Waiting For  January 2  2016By Benjamin K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is the camera I've been looking for.My interest in photography goes way back but it wasn't until I got my first iPhone (the 4S)  that I was able to start exploring. From there I bought a Fuji HS30EXR which was very highly recommended and had awful image quality; next I purchased a Sony NEX-6 which was light-years ahead of the Fuji but I always felt like something was missing. So I bought the Sony a6000 and suffered immediate buyer's remorse (though I eventually bought its little brother the RX100 m2 which is my much-loved coat-pocket camera). I was always looking for that missing something. And not being trained at all in photography never having taken any classes and having to learn everything on my own from books and websites I could never put my finger on what that something was. Until I discovered the D5500.The D5500 takes great pictures. It's also harder to use than the a6000. But it feels like a real camera. It's comfortable in my (somewhat large) hands. Compared to the CSC Sony cameras I've owned it feels more like a tool than a toy. As I say it's more challenging to use (no Focus Peaking!) and as a result I'm more satisfied when I take a decent exposure. And it is sharp in part because modern Nikons lack anti-aliasing filters. An Anti-Aliasing Filter serves to soften your images to prevent moiré- a sort of banding that occurs in high-contrast patterns (think a striped dress) when recorded by a digital sensor. (You may have seen these patterns on an old tube t.v. screen when you were a kid too.) In my opinion the benefit of having 24mp is not that you necessarily get a ""better"" image- you get more room to crop. I like to take pictures of the moon and it's nice to be able to zoom in and inspect the surface. The Sony's were way too soft when zoomed in at 50% let alone 100%. This may not be the case for the full-frame Sony cameras but the APS-C models leave a lot to be desired. As far as those cameras are concerned 24mp is about 16mp wasted.The D5500 feels great in hand nice and light but still substantial with a good amount of grip and it truly is optimized to help amatuers like me get the shot they want. It's fast (though not as quick in burst mode as the a6000) and the touchscreen is a treat coming from Sony (menus within menus within menus within menus...) making it super easy to change aperture ISO shutter speed etc. The lens selection is fantastic whether you go Nikon or third-party (I've already added the AF-S 35mm and the 55-200mm VRII to my bag) although there is an obvious emphasis on pro gear.The D5500 is the camera for me. Every single box (image quality feel looks) is neatly checked. I find myself spending less time in Lightroom and more time with a camera in my hands and I find that leaving things like ISO up to the camera (unthinkable on Sony's APS-C cameras which render unusable images after ISO 6400 or so) not only renders great images but makes it that much easier (and enjoyable) for me to bungle my way through this silly expensive hobby of mine. I would recommend this camera to everyone who wants to go beyond smartphones and point-and-shoots.Side note- I chose the D5500 over the D7200 for several reasons that you may or may not agree with but here they are:1. The D5500 and the D7200 have the same sensor. IQ should be the same.2. The D7200 is $400 more. Although I love my D5500 I will probably not be as fond of it in three or four years. But the lenses could conceivably last for decades with proper care. As better photographers than me have said buy only as much camera as you need and spend the rest on lenses.3. Simpler exterior. I'm not ready for all the buttons and dials yet. Stepping up to the D7000 series will be next but that's several years from now. I felt it was better to become accustomed to the DSLR form factor before dropping $1100 on the camera body alone.As far as the Nikon vs. Canon debate is concerned I'm uninterested. I chose the D5500 over the comparable Canons for a couple of reasons.1. Nikon bodies seem to cost less than their Canon counterparts but are rated more highly; the Canon t6s is more expensive and does not perform as well. Ditto the 70d.2. Nikon has legacy lens support unmatched by Canon. Will I ever take advantage of it? Who knows but I like the idea.3. Canon DSLR's don't render color as well in my opinion Easy fix I know- but still.That being said I'm certain that a skilled photographer could get great pictures from just about anything so don't get yourself bogged down in fruitless Nikon vs. Canon DSLR vs. Mirrorless/M43 Android vs. Apple type debates. Just take pictures!",1

July 30  2016By Chris G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Like most people here this is my first DSLR. But unlike most people I am starting to get semi-pro usage out of it only after a year of owning it. And it doesn't disappoint. When paired with better glass the camera really does shine. The light weight body comes in handy when trekking up a mountain or shooting an all day festival and the deep grip is reassuring as you make your way around the world. I can't attest for the auto setting because I am forcing myself to learn by always staying in manual. Kind of a ""baptism by fire"" approach. Didn't take tack long to get the feel of where all the buttons are located and I really appreciate that it has a programmable back focus button. The touch screen is responsive and the tilt comes in handy when either shooting low down and especially when on a monopod shooting high up.  Autofocus is decent and doesn't hunt too much. Photos are usually tack sharp even at 1:1. I'm impressed with how clear photos are when pushing the iso way up for concerts and the DX sensor with 24.2 megapixels allows you to crop way down and still keep crisp shots for wildlife and the like.  All and all I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who is interested in moving up from a point and shoot without breaking the bank. Provided some shots but here is a Flickr link of more shots all from the d5500.[...]",1

I am not a professional photographer but because of this awesome easy to use (after reading the book) camera all of my friends are asking me to photograph them and their families.

August 31  2016By Leslie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This really is an amazing camera at a very reasonable price. I am just breaking into the photography industry and sometimes when I am around other photographers I feel a little embarrassed that my camera my not be a big or impressive as theirs but then I see my photos and I know this camera is just what I need. Photo quality is so much about the lens and settings that you likely don't need a very expensive or bulky body to get started. Some day I may upgrade but for now I will continue to spend my money on glass. I bought a 35mm f/1.8 prime lens and it took my photos to a whole new level. Invest in a good lens!Anyway a few more details. The camera is incredibly lightweight which I love. The body is also very comfortable in my hands and easy to use. My only complaint is that the back-button focus feature assigns the AE lock button as the focus button and it doesn't seem to work quite right. Sometimes the focus works great and other times it locks my photos and I miss the focus. I am not sure why this is happening but I wish there was a separate back-button focus.,1

I'm very happy with it so far. I love the red color which looks more true red than the image that appears on my screen.  The color aides in being able to tell my camera bodies apart at a glance as well which is actually why I chose the red. It's both smaller and lighter than my D5000 which is very nice as every ounce counts when you're predominantly an outdoor and nature photographer like I am.  The grip is deeper and more comfortable. Changing lenses feels much smoother on this model.The LCD screen is noticeably larger easier to see and display of higher quality visually.  The touch screen works well and makes quick operation easier. The touch screen has some fun and interesting capabilities too namely touch focus and shutter release when in live view. However I found that while the first couple of times taking photos using the screen as a shutter release is fun it quickly becomes a nuisance when every accidental touch of the screen becomes a photo you didn't mean to take.  So I disabled that feature early on.  But I did keep the touch screen's spot focus feature on.  Though I'm predominantly a viewfinder shooter being able to focus right where I want just by touching the screen when I am using live view is great. You can also get pinpoint focus accuracy by zooming in while in live view. I'll still rely on my viewfinder and spot focusing manually for the majority of my shooting though just because that's what I'm more comfortable with.  But I suspect that LCD spot focusing capability will be a well used feature among many.My favorite upgrade is the expanded ISO.  It goes to 25600 whereas my old camera only went to 3200.  This gives me MUCH more capability and flexibility in lower lighting.  I ran some high ISO tests the first day I got it and was happy to see that I can easily go to several thousand ISO and still have an acceptable image especially after applying a noise reduction filter in post processing.The built in flash is not quite as powerful as my old one but still enough to do the trick when you're not using a speed light but need something more than the available light.  I'm pleased with the results of my flash and exposure compensation tests.They've moved some buttons around but I'm finding operation pretty much the same as the D5000 or at least an intuitive jump from the older model. There's been nothing that I haven't been able to quickly and easily discern after using the D5000 for years.  I think anyone familiar with any of Nikon's models in this series will find switching to this one an easy transition.One negative I noticed in my initial tests is that settings change and a noticeable reduction in image quality is visible if using the continuous shooting mode compared to single shot mode in low light high ISO tests. Focus seemed far more challenging for hand held shots in continuous shooting mode even though the camera automatically increased the shutter speed while shooting in aperture priority mode. I suspect this is due to mirror movement but am disappointed since continuous is my preferred mode.  I'll be running more tests in better lighting outside once we're out of this cold snap and will try to remember to update this review with my results.  Nonetheless this is my only disappointment thus far. I'm very pleased with everything else.In summary I'd highly recommend this camera body to anyone on somewhat of a budget who wants a good quality DSLR that accommodates everyone from the point and shoot hobby photographer to the fully manual serious photographer. Due to its size and weight it's particularly great for anyone who does a lot of outdoor work and/or has to lug their gear around a lot. It's the kind of good quality you'd expect from Nikon.,0

My husband actually bought this camera for me with the 18-55 lens and I returned it for the 18-140 mm. That was definitely a good decision- minimal cost and size difference for a huge upgrade in range. Instead of always carrying around a 18-55mm and a 55-300mm I only use this one lens for daily use. Different story if you're a professional but for someone who doesn't want to carry around multiple lenses this is the best kit.I would recommend against buying the camera with accessories packages. They may seem like a good deal but typically contain useless or poor-quality accessories so it's not worth it in the end. Put good thought into what you need and then research your options... or you'll find yourself with a cheap quality accessories that ruin your photos. This camera is capable of taking amazing pictures only if the accessories don't ruin the quality.,0

Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great camera and quite the upgrade from the D80 that I had been using since 2007.  Not as physically smaller as i had expected from reading some reviews but I think that is a positive because it is still easy to handle.  The biggest differences from the older Nikon DSLRs are the weight and the high ISO performance.  This camera is super light and with a small/light lens is very easy to carry around.  The high ISO performance is amazing.  I used to hesitate to use anything over ISO 800 because of the distracting noise but with this camera I don't even think about it.I do with that it had the dedicated dedicated buttons of the D80 but you have to step up to the D7xxx series for that.  That being said the touch screen is fast and responsive and once you get used to it all relevant functions are within easy reach.For those concerned about purchasing this refurbished camera through Beech Camera or Cameta Camera have no fear.  Both are solid reputable sellers and the camera is not gray market.If you are in the market for a DSLR that has more bells and whistles than the D3xxx series but don't want to pay the big bucks for the D7xxx models the D5500 hits the sweet spot.  Especially for the refurbished price!,0

Douglas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It has been 4 months since I researched and purchased this camera. For the sake of a real world review I am not going back to do the research to get my numbers EXACT. I am going to make a comparison against our D40 which we have used for 8 years. The improvements are as noted.8 years ago we bought a Nikon D40 with the 18-200MM zoom lens. That is a 6MP camera which has traveled thousands of miles and taken 68000 pictures.We bought this camera to move into the 24MP world before our first trip to Europe. What a difference the 8 years has made in the Nikon world! I won't bore you with details but I will say that this camera is 10 times as sensitive in low light conditions as the D40 (ISO up to 32000 or so) and about 4 times as fast in shooting burst mode as the D40. It has a multi-focal point focus system that uses around up 32 discrete points in the picture for best available focus (the D40 has 1 2 or 3) and it writes information to ultra fast SD Cards. Oh yeah - it is also 2.4 ozs lighter than the D40 with an improved grip (at least about 80% of folks think it is improved - so try it in your own hands)>,0

I love the functionality of the flip out screen which is larger and more sleek than the canon models.  when I was searching for a camera I was debating between the canon and nikon and ended up with the nikon d5500.  in my price range this camera had so many more options and I love the build.  this camera is a great deal as it even comes with built in wifi (which would cost $40+ extra to get on any other camera that lacked this feature).  with in camera wifi you can download the nikon wireless mobile utility app and use your phone as a shutter remote! you can get great quality photos with this camera without breaking the bank.  it is a great body and you can invest in good glass to enhance your photos.  perhaps the only downside I can think of is that it is a crop sensor but at the time when I was a beginner and I was looking at cameras I had no idea what that meant.  if you're looking for a full frame sensor then skip on this camera but if you are not sure what those terms mean this camera will get the job done.  I do recommend to upgrade your lenses as soon as possible  do not stick with the kit lens forever.  personally I love the 50mm f1.8. don't be afraid to get our of your comfort zone and get our there and start shooting! :),1
DSLR Cameras,B00WBIYADC,Pentax K-3II Pentax DSLR (Body Only),        62 of 65 people found the following review helpful       OH BABY A K-Triple II  July 24  2015By David C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this camera about a week after it was released. I previously had a D5300(dropped it) and I was unsure if I should get a D7200 or The K-3II both being in the same price point. Ended up going for the K-3ii.No flash: I don't use the flash as much and saw myself carrying a separate flash unit even when I had the d5300.GPS: I was skeptical about the GPS on this one. The built in GPS on the D5300 would take about 10 seconds to adjust. So every time the screen turned off it would have to look for the GPS signal and it was a battery killer. The GPS in the K-3ii takes about 2 seconds and doesn't affect the battery as much.Weather Sealed: I paired it with a 18-55 mm WR lens I haven't used much the WR since California is currently in a drought but it will come in handy eventually. There aren't many WR lenses available. I use a 35mm prime and would buy a 35mm WR in a heartbeat (50mm WR is available tho)Lens: Works with every pentax lens. I currently have it paired with an 18-55 WR Pentax 35mm f/2.4 Pentax and an old Pentax-M 50mm f/2. All works perfectly the newer ones focus very fast. The old one doesnt have AF.Body: Sexy magnesium-alloy body. The style is different from Nikons and Canons its more squary which I liked.Viewfinder: Pentaprism enough said.CONS: 1. It can't toast toast.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00WBIYADC,Pentax K-3II Pentax DSLR (Body Only),        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Best camera at an incredible price point  July 6  2016By Photographer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Jan 19 2017 updateOne of the reasons for getting the K-3II was pixel shift capability. I must say that I am amazed by the increased resolution and dynamic range. I have done recently HDR in conjunction with pixel shift. The results were just jaw dropping. Viewing at 100% on a 27"" 2560X1440 monitor it is still sharp with incredible details. This is the kind of sharpness and micro-contrast that I have only seen produced by high resolution medium format cameras. A benefit from this revelation is that my lenses are still keeping well with the sensor no need to upgrade.Original:This is my 8th Pentax dSLR replacing a K-5IIs and a K-S2. The out-going cameras are still fine tools but no comparison to the K-3II. The fit-and-finish of the K-3II is the best very solid substantial but not heavy or too big. The shutter is incredibly soft quiet and smooth. K-5 & K-5IIs already have excellent shutter but K-3II again is better.AF is much improved over previous models. Some AF fine adjustments were necessary for all previous models; however none is needed for lenses tested so far - 16-85 50-135 Sigma 70-200 OS. AF is fast and confident on these 3 lenses. Resolution is incredible; I was not prepared when I saw the fine details.Aug 7 2016 updateJust finished a long overseas vacation. Local weather was hot and humid the camera performed flawlessly. AF with 16-85 was fast secure and accurate. I am very familiar with the Sony 16 MP in K-5 series but this 24 MP sensor is just stunning. There is at least one stop of highlight headroom when using RAW. Dynamic range is also excellent with easy 3 stops shadow recovery. I never realize how useful the GPS was until now. I can easily pin point the exact location of where an image was taken. Finally I did try the pixel shift function. It actually works quite well for static subjects. SR on this camera is definitely improved over that of K-5 series.Unless you have extra money you don't know what to do with it this camera represents the best APS DSLR and the best value also. Highly recommended.",0

I had been an avid photographer when I was younger in the Navy..back in the days of 35mm film with your choice of ISO...I think it was ASA back then-and my camera of choice was Pentax. I digress...I originally purchased a Pentax K50 and absolutely love that camera...but...when I get into something I always go overboard and want the best. The K50 had limitations and I kept looking at the K 3. The K 3 II came out and I couldn’t resist. It is a great piece of equipment and I don’t think anyone will be disappointed if they get one. Versatile comfortable ergonomics and a matte black and rubberised finish. I like that it does not have a pop-up flash...I have very seldom been satisfied with the results of using a pop up flash. This also has no programmed settings such as “beach” “portrait” “pets” etc... forcing you to learn how to set up your camera manually to get the best shots. It does have a “green” setting-which is quite like “auto”.  Compatible with all my Pentax DSLR lenses. Love it....,0

I have been a Pentax DSLR user for many years and upgraded to the K-3 II from a K200D and couldn't be happier. While I loved the 200D this camera is light years ahead in every way. Very rugged excellent build quality and fit and finish amazing features and lots of buttons means less fumbling around in various menus. A GPS receiver replaces a built-in flash but that is ok I use an external flash anyway and the GPS is very helpful if you want to return to that perfect spot. Excellent camera and great price!,0

December 25  2015By Peter G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The bad. I wish I waited another week and I could have saved $10! The good. Everything. (No tech-spec review here--get that elsewhere). This is my 5th Pentax digital camera. I recently sold off everything thinking I was gong to take the leap into mirrorless. But after a full week of research (hands-on videos reviews ratings etc.) I realized this camera is everything I need still. So at just over $700 the decision was simple. Very small compared to other DSLR's. Built like a tank. Fits perfect in my hands. Easy to carry for a couple hours (with hand strap) with a shorter lens. Great in low-light. Awesome 8fps for sports and wildlife. Super quiet shutter compared to the other brands. With 2 or 3 of the pancakes lenses (can be had used for cheap) a nice 2.8 mid-range zoom and maybe a longer zoom for sports/wildlife is all anyone will ever need. And WAAAY cheaper than any of the mirrorless systems out there. I priced out the top (my top ) 3 mirrorless...Fuji Samsung Olympus and the best I could do for any body and a fast prime lens was over $2k close and $3K if you tried to add a second prime lens!! I got this body 3 Yongnuo flashes a trigger a 50mm prime a 17-70 prime and a new tripod for well under $2k. You do the math.For anyone that STILL for whatever reason has any hesitation about joining the Pentax community just do it. I completely understand it but as soon as you hold this camera you will be in love with it. And you can take this Everywhere All The Time! That is a huge bonus in my book.  For the lazy or inexperienced there are numerous and very nice auto settings filters etc but this camera excels when you make it do what YOU want it to do. So save yourself hours of research and flow charts trying to figure out what camera/system is the ""best"". I did all that again and ended right back where I started. I couldn't be happier.",0

I have had the istD K10 K20 K7 K5 K5iis.  I am a Pentaxian. I first thought that I would wait for the K 1 after my wonderful time over 2 years with the k5iis.  What the k3ii does is perfect the aps-c format.  I am doing things with this camera that I could not do with the k5iis.  The Video interval mode at 4K is tremedous.  I have done short films at 1 min intervals on garden items up to 8 hrs.  How fun to have the movie already made  I just use Windows moviemaker to speed up or slow down.  Having up to 9 fps has been fantastic for sports work and the pixel shift for still life's is unmatched.  I did not buy the k3 as it was not better than the k5iis.  The k3ii is and I have no issue with the missing flash but love having the gps built in.  I likely will get a k1 when they update it to fully match the features of the k3ii in 18 months and the price comes down.  Pentax is the leading innovator now  and after 32 years with Pentax I look forward to its future,0
DSLR Cameras,B00WBIYADC,Pentax K-3II Pentax DSLR (Body Only),        10 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Solid. Crisp. Clear.  December 1  2015By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,About 25 years ago I received my first SLR camera. It was a Vivitar V-2000 camera. It was a 35mm clone of the Pentax K1000 which was the standard for hobbyist photographers almost from its first release in 1976.Roughly ten years ago I was looking to get into the digital SLR game. I had two options and I chose the Pentax K10D over the equivalent Canon at the time. That K10D served me well. The fact that I could use my old Vivitar lens with the new camera was just icing on the cake. Over the last decade I've gotten more and more serious about my photography. I'm still a hobbyist mind you but that doesn't mean I'll settle for less than the best. I have about a dozen lenses of various powers and speeds.When my phone's camera had the same number of megapixels as my primary digital camera I realized it was time to upgrade.  I like Pentax cameras and I love Pentax lenses so I quickly narrowed it down to the K-3 and the K-3II.  There are a host of small differences between the two but the most important difference is the flash vs the GPS.  The K-3 has a little pop-up flash. The K-3II replaces that with a GPS logger.If you're just getting started and don't have an external flash already you may still want to consider the K-3. If you're getting this for family photos at holiday gatherings you may want to consider the K-3. But if you're serious and are buying the camera as a tool instead of as a toy then I can without hesitation recommend the K-3II. But I'd still suggest you take a look at the K-3 to see if it does what you need it to do.Remember also that the lens you choose will make a significant different for you as well.I was surprised at how well the autofocus was able to find (and focus on) my black cat. The K10D would focus and refocus and refocus over and over as it tried to find the cat.  This had no problems at all.The attached photos were taken with the Pentax DA 50mm f1.8 lens for Pentax DSLR Cameras. I threw the aperture wide open and used autofocus and auto white balance just as a test.  I'm very pleased with the results.,1

January 26  2016By Pentaxian,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Feels great on hand(you'll understand when you go at your camera store and try one). The buttons are on the sweet spots where you could easily press them while taking pictures. Only use PSR on tripod. Weather sealing is great. Works well with vintage lenses. Live view is great. The built-in shake reduction works really well for me. I generally prefer built-in geo tagging(depends on what you shoot I shoot street and landscape)than the flash cause I never really use the built-in flash. This camera is best for outdoor photography(hiking beach street forest wildlife etc) and it doesn't give a damn about the weather. Durable body you could shoot with this camera all day.

March 5  2016By Zach,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I LOVE this camera! True it is my first DSLR (background in film SLR however so I was able to pick up most functions of this camera pretty quickly) but this thing is amazing. I actually bought a used one from here on Amazon a stressful experience considering how much money was involved. I could not be happier with my purchase and getting this level of camera at the price I was able to find it here was pretty amazing. This also allowed me to pick up the 18-135mm zoom lens. In hindsight I wish I would have opted for the 50mm and 28mm primes first. They are faster (larger aperture = more light coming in = more versatile lens for low light and such). I have since picked up the f1.8 50mm also a great find.I was looking for a camera that would allow me to grow with it. This absolutely fits that bill. Unless you are looking to shoot a full frame this camera will probably do far more than what you need. I highly recommend it.,0
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        2 211 of 2 297 people found the following review helpful       Amazing camera -  D800 replacement?  May 8  2012By Waikiki,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Like many folks I pre-ordered the D800 the same day it was available.  Alas Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula.  After waiting 2 months I had to leave the country before Nikon got it's D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder.  I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too!  Sure the D3200 is DX not FX.  Sure it is not nearly as flexible.  Sure it can only AF with newer lenses.  BUT you can buy about 4-D3200's for the price of a D800 AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners which I am not so I find it maddening.  Most will love it since it is somewhat educational and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster but it's plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 & F4). The high-res LCD rear screen the EXPEED 3 image processing engine and a new 24MP sensor.  The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera.  Nikon's Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power.I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses & technique the results are stunning.  Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free and look great. Still life's on a tripod at ISO 100 have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used with very little shadow noise.  In short I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available.  I might use the D3200 longer than I thought (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year -- my guesses on price & stats & date)...or just keep using the D3200.  If it breaks (I'm hard on cameras) I'll just buy a new one.Bottom line -- the D3200: super light-weight very quiet super high resolution (& low noise high dynamic range superb colors) incredible HD video with slow motion.  It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!5/14/12 UPDATE: I've now shot 100s of images using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm.  I've learned a lot.  Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface one automatically thinks you will get images with twice the resolution (12MP vs 24MP). Not so.  MP resolution is measured linearly so the increase while significant is less than doubled.  More importantly when you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere photographic technique & lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP's this camera has to offer.  Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It's probably you...BTW the Nikon 18-55mm is a decent lens but it doesn't do this imager justice.  You can get better results with better glass.  The excellent f1.8 35mm DX Nikon on this camera makes a super-light weight compact package you can carry all day long producing super images.  A 60 year-old Nikkor Q 200mm f4 $70 or so on eBay produces stunning results if carefully used on Manual on a tripod.Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it.  Use the sharpest lens you have  at f 8 on a sturdy tripod perpendicular to the table Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old & new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side enlarged to 100%.How does this translate to everyday casual shooting?  Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used.  If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made all of this won't matter -- grab a D3200 and shoot away!  Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery.  If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber it's a good thing -- the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!5/5/13 UPDATE.  It's been a year.  I have a D800 and a D3200.  Yes there are many differences between the two.  One is at the high end of the spectrum the other entry level.  When I'm shooting commercially or seriously in any way it's the D800.  It is a superb camera if you own glass that can fully exploit the 36MP sensor and your technique is solid. For everything else I use the D3200.  Why?  It's light and compact.  You can easily carry it around all day with the f1.8 35mm and hardly know it's there.  If that lens isn't wide enough shoot a 3-frame series and stitch them together in Photoshop.  Again with good glass and technique the results are very very good.  D800 territory? No but few would notice. The D3200 is a pleasure to use and handles fast enough for most kinds of photography. You can use old manual Nikkor lenses easily albeit with a bit more effort.  With the focus confirmation dot in the viewfinder manual focusing is easy.  Exposure can be guessed and adjusted using the great hi-res LCD.  I recently had to shoot an emergency-rush job covering a politician's speech. All I had in the car was the D3200 the 35mm f1.8 and an old sharp 100mm f2.8 E Nikkor  -- my normal in-car-at all-times stash.  The setting was indoors in a bright garden area -- no flash allowed.  I was surrounded by folks with Nikon D4's and $1500 lenses.  I got a few looks....LOL.  I boosted the ISO to 1600 used the $50 100mm @ f4 @1/125th and the results were great published in several places.  The D3200 is a great camera for the money I like it more now than when I first bought it!,0

April 14  2015By Ruben D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,La la llaaovveee this camera!! Just to start this review  I'm super ocd with my purchases. Definitely more lenient with purchases worth less I'll admit  but not for a piece worth almost 400$. I reaseched on different websites and even visited a few stores for the best deal. Long story short this was it after about a week or two or hunting the best deal . It does not get better than this folks. The camera came brand spanking new. It came with original accessories like neck strap battery cap for camera Lense cap and battery charger also a Manuel and cd for the camera oh and cords for the camera. Of course the camera also came with a brand new Lense too AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. Yeah this Lense alone is worth 250. Also the standard Lense for the d3200 is the AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR not VR II.. So think this was a added bonus for buying the refurbished item and having faith in nikon. I'm transitioning from a SLR a FE2 to be exact. I love the functionality and all the capabilities of  this camera thus far. The resolution on the screen really helps make bold adjustments too. This is the perfect camera for the aspiring beginner photographer.  I'll post pics hopes this helps anyone trying to make a decision. Please like if it has thanks,1
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        57 of 59 people found the following review helpful       The perfect beginner's SLR - NIkon quality at a remarkable price  July 3  2014By DigiForceps,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I am amazed at this little bundle. If you are new and want a nice inexpensive DSLR but are drowning/hesitating among all the options and prices don't. Just buy this you will not regret it. I picked up this refurb kit a month ago for $365 and I did a double take because I couldn't believe everything I was getting. I personally shoot with my trusty old D90 still but this was for a specific project that needed a dedicated camera. I have to admit that this shoots way more reliably than my D90. It's focus is incredibly fast and the metering is Nikon perfect. It's amazing what half a decade in technology leads to both in quality and in price.This D3200 bundle is the ideal camera for someone who is looking to step up from point-and-shoot cameras and phone snapshots and get started with digital photography. It is pretty full-featured and has amazing picture quality for a fraction of the cost of the more expensive models. Basically this is a way to get into the hobby or dramatically improve the quality of your pictures without breaking the bank. I couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It looked brand new to me. Not a scratch or a nick anywhere and the LCD was bright and crystal clear. With this you can produce stunning photos (and videos) without being reduced to tears if you drop it on accident or be too afraid to hand it to a friend/relative to take a picture for you. As is often said having the best (read: most expensive) camera in the world is useless if you're too afraid to take it outside and take pictures.The lens on this is a perfect first lens. It's 18-55mm which means it's a zoom lens (you spin a ring on the lens to select the region you are capturing zooming in one way and zooming out the other). It's sharp fast and handles low light decently. I'd of course recommend the spectacular fixed 35mm for its tack sharpness and to shine in low-light as well as the 55-200mm to give you some telephoto (serious distance zoom) coverage but these lenses each cost half the price of this camera kit! You can see how photography can become a very expensive hobby very quickly. I'd hold off on those as a first purchase and wait to see how things go.But this is why this kit in particular is a great starter package. You get an entry level but still very solid camera body and a decent zoom lens. Don't let the term ""entry level"" make you feel cheap this is still a Nikon camera with a legitimate Nikkor lens. It is categorically different and more capable than any point and shoot or pinhole phone camera. Period. End of discussion. If you find that you want/need more Nikon will be more than happy to sell you more lenses or step up to a more expensive camera body later. For the first step though this is ideal.I should note that in addition to taking ridiculously high quality photos this also does quite well with video. It can do 1080p video at up to 30 fps or 720p at 60 fps. I'd have loved to have seen 1080p at 60fps but you don't get that unless you go to the D3300 or D5300 which cost tons more than this D3200 kit. That's just not worth the extra cost.In practice I've been amazed. Even under terrible lighting conditions (e.g. indoor low light under coiled fluorescent lights with completely mismatched color temperatures and an LCD as an intended capture target) I can get remarkable photo and video quality with perfect color reproduction. Nikon's white balance settings do sheer magic where even a prosumer camcorder just fails miserably (I'm looking at you Sony). Sure some of the knobs and dials are tucked away in menus and not as easily accessible as on the more pro-level cameras but for the price I'll deal with fiddling with the menus on the few times that I need them (honestly my D90 was overwhelming for months when I first got it). For the vast majority of the time I just set it to program or manual mode and fire away. It's beautiful.",0

DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        10 of 10 people found the following review helpful       Best DSLR for the money.  May 10  2014By Peter Haight,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Although I know my review will fall between the other high-rated ones eventually I thought i'd share my positive experiences with this camera.PROS:-Price. $500 is cheap in comparison to other similar (albeit lower quality) cameras like the Canon Rebel T3i 60D or even the newer T5i.-Build Quality. This camera is built in Thailand to the extent of my knowledge but the quality control on mine is absolutely incredible. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Has nice grips and a comfortable weight to it. Not an overly bulky camera either.-Image quality/sensor. At $500 you get a true 24.2 megapixel DSLR camera. SnapSort in their comparison of the D3200 vs its direct competitor the Canon Rebel T3i 18 megapixel DSLR stated that the image quality on the D3200 is over 20% better as attributed to the D3200's 10% larger image sensor and higher true megapixel count which accounts for 30% more detail in photos. The image sensor is very high quality and this camera consistently takes incredible pictures. I'm not a professional photography by any means this is simply a great hobby of mine but I am a perfectionist about pictures. The ability to easily take awesome pictures with this camera is second to none.-Ease of use. I am an amateur photographer who was looking for a nice upgrade and I made sure to do my homework when it came to selecting a camera. I ended up on this camera because of what everybody else said it's ease of use was a major selling factor in the purchase. I've had this camera for a few weeks and I still haven't even figured out everything it's capable of-- there's quite a bit! But the guide mode helps you with some basic and advanced photography.-Nice lens kit. Out of the box I'll admit the 18-55mm is quite limited in what it can do especially as somebody who enjoys macrophotography but it'll be able to do most of the shots you'd like to take. The VR feature is nice as well.-Nikon brand quality. As always Nikon has delivered a high quality product. I've owned a few Nikon products before and they've never failed me. I prefer Nikons to Canons in the world of DSLRs anyway.-Ability to save as JPG/Raw.-Out of the box: comes with body lens strap battery and charger etc.CONS:-I can't really seem to think of any that aren't dumb little nitpicks.Final thoughts: This camera is perfect for the beginner and good enough for the master. It does it all!,0

It works great for the beginner and is capable of growing with you as you gain confidence with photography and with the camera itself.  When this first arrived I was overwhelmed by all of the buttons.  I never thought I would learn them.  After reviewing the included literature once I feel reasonably confident on playing with some manual settings.  It takes phenomenal pictures in auto ""point-and-shoot"" mode and has several auto/manual modes that seemed to be designed to take you from ""what is a DSLR?"" to ""I think a lower F-stop would really bring out her eyes.""  The pictures in fully automated mode are vivid crisp and well-exposed for just about any subject in nearly any lighting condition.  My cellphone camera takes pictures that make me look like a manic gorilla but this camera makes me look like a professional.",1
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        8 of 8 people found the following review helpful       Nikon D3200 First Choice for SLR  creative camera users.  September 5  2014By MJH-64 Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After being a professional wedding photographer for over 23 years. (retired now)  Using a heavy 35 mm manual camera and miles of film.... This Nikon D3200 was my first choice for a digital SLR updated camera.  Being fairly  new to ""digital"" SLR. I caught on to the instructions  pretty fast since it's almost the same as it used to be on my old camera.  The concept and rules of photography didn't change....  I found that using this camera was pretty easy after going through the instruction book plus trial and error just taking photos with the camera.  This camera has all the features that I would use.... even has a photo editor in the menu... color enhancer crop red eye corrector  change photo to black and white even has a star filter add in... warming or cooling effect  lots of added stuff.. I used to do in the darkroom with color prints manually.This camera comes with a lens 18 to 55 mm witch to me is a great small zoom lens but it  wouldn't be my prime lens.  I would use a straight  35 mm for all around use can use the lens in much lower light without a flash  and the 18 to 55 mm for other things like family gatherings where you don't have to step around to get your shot  just zoom in or out to make the frame fit the subject being photographed.The camera has a pop up flash witch is real handy and easy to use good for about ten to twelve feet.  Notice the flash is slightly higher then the lens.  You are more then likely going to get red eye pretty easy if the subject looks at the camera lens while being photographed ... The fix is having a TTL. external dedicated  flash on the hot shoe that bounces off the ceiling ....much better results.My research  home work paid off  I believe ..... I was looking at the D3300  newer camera model  and the specs. didn't change much but the price went up for the newer model... so I saved about sixty bucks buying the older model camera.  The D3200 started new add on's after the D3100  like one I noticed  would be the wireless controller remote shutter  ML-L3Buying the VR lens was worth the extra money.  They do sell this without the VR lens.... for less $.  You need V R on your lens  when you use any kind of zoom lens..... Keeps the vibration down for less blurring on slower shutter speeds or fast moving objects.  VR = Vibration ReducerOverall This Nikon D3200 was my First choice for an all around SLR camera.....  Once you get your SLR camera in your hands your pretty much will be commented to it.  Then it starts to be a collection of ""products to fit""  and add on to the camera.  Since you can do so much more being creative photography with this camera over a point and shoot camera.  I gave this 5 Stars.",0
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Dollar for dollar it's hard to beat  December 29  2015By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Probably the best starter DSLR on the market of any brand as of December 2015. Yes there is a newer model (the d3300) available but if you can save $100 I'd still get this one. The new model is unnoticeablely lighter allows you to shoot 1 fps faster if needed and gives you the ability to create panoramics in-camera (plenty of free software is out there for that already) and the ISO goes up even higher (although the image quality is terrible at those high ISO's on both models). Is that all really worth the price increase for an entry level crop-sensor dslr... most likely not.Features: You get all the basic features you need. They don't overload this model with tons of features most people will never use. The omission of all the fancy little used features unless you're into a specific style of photography creates a learning curve for this camera that is fairly easy especially if you have any background using camera controls.Side note: This camera requires AF-S lenses to autofocus since it does not have a built in-camera focus motor. Not a huge issue (both lenses that come with it are AF-S) just something to be aware of. The biggest complaint I read on lens reviews is certain lenses being only manual focus with this camera. That's because they bought an AF lens when they needed an AF-S lens and really no fault of either product.Build: Very quality build both in materials and design. It's not weather sealed but I wouldn't take my weather sealed full frame cameras out in the rain either if I didn't have to so this doesn't affect me much.Image/Video quality: Plainly put both are wonderful. Full HD video with the push of a button is great and still something a few pro Nikon's still don't do (I'm looking at you D7--).  The picture quality is wonderful in shooting conditions with adequate light. To be fair any lighting issues with this camera tend to fall more on the lenses than the camera itself. 24.2MP is way more than you need to produce quality images. Megapixel count is more of a marketing gimmick nowadays unless you're blowing up photos to cover an entire wall in a house.Lenses included: These are Nikon's plasticy kit lenses. Months/years from now if you move into full-frame phtography both these lenses will work on your new camera just not well... but that's a big ""if"" you decide to buy that level of camera. With that being said they are extremely sharp lenses that will cover an adequate range for most of your shooting. Don't forget crop sensors (like this camera and most other budget dslr's have) actually magnify the lens coverage (and not degrade the picture quality) so the 200mm lens you get will work more like a 300mm lens. that's plenty of zooms for what most people need. Both lenses included should treat you well.A big bonus this camera accepts all the pre-AI prime lenses Nikon made some being 50 years old now! These are some phenomenal lenses you can buy on most auction sites for very cheap.Overall: It easily earns five stars. Ease of use and image quality are all top notch. Owning Nikon's nicest DSLR's for my photography business (I currently own D4's D810's and a D610) I purchased one to test out and ended up using it for personal use for about half a year loving every second of it. Would I recommend this to a professional? No. Would I recommend this to any of my friends looking for a great dslr without spending thousands of dollars? Yes... and it would be my first choice.Just shooting the family? Are you a student looking to take a photography class? This might be your best choice.WARNING: VERIFY THE MODEL YOU ARE BUYING IS A USA VERSION. Easiest way to confirm: 99% of these have a serial number (on the bottom of the camera) starting with a 3. Import (aka Grey Market) Nikon's are often bought MUCH cheaper buy non-legit sellers and then sold again to you. If they are the import model you should be paying a LOT less. And keep in mind Nikon's warranties do not apply to ANY import model. In fact their service centers WILL NOT TOUCH OR FIX an import model no matter where or when you bought it... they will just mail it back to you at your expense. If it breaks or has any issue you have no other option than to buy a new camera.",0
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Great Camera...But spend some extra and buy one with a VR (Vibration Resistance) lens  August 26  2016By D.S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a great camera. I have one.HOWEVER...beware that this bundle comes with a lens that is non-VR.VR stands for Vibration Resistance.Unless you plan on taking still shots with a tripod and remote then the lens will prove itself useless to you.To hand hold a camera with a non-VR lens produces images that look out of focusThat's because it is impossible to hold a camera without your hand having some degree of shaking/movement.I recommend spending the extra for a VR lens.In my opinion I think that manufacturers should make it clear to consumers that non VR lenses have limited functionality.I have known a few beginners who have put money into their cameras/lenses not knowing the significance ofthis and so disappointed that their photos aren't crisp and focused.,0
DSLR Cameras,B007VGGFZU,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        48 of 53 people found the following review helpful       and had a much better idea of what she was doing  November 24  2014By ZDuBois,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I gave this camera to my girlfriend as an anniversary gift.  I've never owned a DSLR camera before - heck my only camera for the past decade has been a cell phone.  She had dabbled in SLR film photography prior to this though and had a much better idea of what she was doing.My first impression of this camera was more or less ""wow... I can actually take pictures in low light without a flash.""  The ability to actually capture what one sees naturally is a pretty huge deal.  This may seem pretty stupid to more experienced photographers but it was a brave new world to me.The instructions which come with the camera are very clear and seem definitely written for someone who has never played with a ""real"" camera before.  There is not only a good explanation of the mechanical features of the camera (ie which buttons do what) but also contain a decent crash course on manual photography.  They explain the basics -  aperture shutter speed ISO and how each of the different settings configure these settings to produce a different quality of image.  Starting with zero background information I was able to develop a decent intuition based on these descriptions and some trial and error (ie - just taking a lot of pictures).  Coming from a film background my girlfriend had the same reaction - ""It's nice to just be able to practice with the camera get instant feedback and not have to worry about film.""One of the complaints I've seen about this camera compared to the slightly more expensive models is that the single thumb wheel is limiting and slows down the photography workflow.  I sort of disagree - at least for a beginner.  First of all the camera has a number of well placed modifier buttons - so if you set the camera to ""manual aperture"" mode the thumb wheel will control the aperture by default and use the magic of DSP to set the shutter speed exposure compensation and ISO.  However if you need to override one of those settings all you need to do is press the correct modifier button and the thumb wheel will then control the corresponding setting until the modifier button is released.  It works the same way in full manual mode except then it then turns off all the automatic compensation features as well.  I sort of like this mechanic as each partial-manual mode provides a single dimension of control (for simplicity) but still allows the user to easily and quickly override the other settings if necessary without turning the mode dial to a different position.  I think it is a great mechanic for beginners since it provides a clear and easy to understand distinction between the various shooting modes while still providing quick access to the rest of the settings.  In that sense I don't see it as a limitation as much as I see it as a somewhat simpler way to learn the camera while also learning the finer points of photography.  However if you are already an expert and understand the ins and outs of the Nikon hardware and software then I could see it being a bit frustrating.  I haven't had to play around inside the menus to control basic settings at all though as some have suggested in other reviews.In terms of build quality what more can I say which has not already been covered?  You definitely are not sacrificing mechanical or ergonomic quality when buying this camera over some of the more expensive ones.  It feels solid but light in the hand.  All the buttons have a nice firm satisfying snappiness to them with no softness or ambiguity and they are all placed in a way which makes sense.  The action on the lenses feels like butter and even though they are plastic - they feel sturdy and high quality.  From what I understand one's ability to shoot at low shutter speeds and small aperture is directly related to one's ability to balance and control the weight of the entire kit so the attention to weight reduction which Nikon has put into this body and the lenses should directly translate to better pictures.  Even the Nikon branded bag which comes with the bundle demonstrates an incredible attention to detail as the interior is completely modular through clever use of velcro dividers which allows the user to easily move and re-size the various compartments.The photographs themselves are stunning.  It's really difficult to put the experience into words.  Just the ability to reliably capture and record what one sees opens a whole world of possibilities in terms of shooting.  It is liberating in a way.  Even if your goal is not to have your photographs published in National Geographic and you just want to document your vacation for posterity being able to do so simply and reliably makes casual photography much more enjoyable.In conclusion - this is a great camera for a beginner and has a ton of room to grow with the user.  Sure there are better sensors out there and more feature-rich cameras but for someone who's primary interest is to learn the basics take fantastic pictures and develop the hobby beyond what is possible with a point-and-shoot camera it really seems like this would be difficult to beat in terms of price quality and performance.",0
DSLR Cameras,B0060MVLXC,Nikon D750 FX-format Digital SLR Camera…,        418 of 429 people found the following review helpful       Good Work  Nikon.  November 26  2014By DSS Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The reason I decided to go with a D750 when I already owned the D610 was it's superior tracking ability of moving subjects in well-lit and low light conditions. I shoot a lot of wildlife especially birds in flight and they are not easy subjects to capture. I also enjoy shooting local live bands in very challenging lighting situations and while my D610 was handling these conditions pretty well it did miss a few shots every now and then that I wish I had gotten. Especially when it comes to birds flying toward me at fast speeds the D610 could not always keep up with them. The keeper rate was acceptable but the D750 simply performs better in these situations. I get more keepers plus I get slightly faster FPS which means I get slightly more frames to choose from.In low light where even my eyes struggle to see any contrast there is no contest between the two cameras. The D750 locks on in near darkness whereas the D600/D610 would hunt under the same conditions. As long as there is contrast visible the D610 will do just fine. I've put it through some difficult circumstances and it handled them better than I expected. The D750 however is just more sure of itself. It hunts less it will lock quickly and your results will be impressive.The image quality of the D750 is great of course just as it is when using the D610. Auto white balance works surprisingly well. Skin tones look nice and so does everything else. Highlight-weighed metering is an interesting option and helps to preserve whites that might otherwise be blown out.At first I felt the flip screen wouldn't do me much good as a still photography shooter but now that I have it I do use it to get some odd angles which I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I'm not always willing to lay on the ground or stand on my tip-toes to get a shot and now I don't have to. The screen is sturdy and hasn't gotten in the way so it seems like a pretty useful feature. Fold it in when not in use bring it out when you need it.Not only does it perform as promised but I have also not experienced any negative issues that may have plagued some past Nikon models. I've shot around 5000 frames with it so far and there are no signs of anything going awry. It focuses fast regardless of light availability and high ISO photos look great especially when processed through Lightroom. Basically if you're looking for an action DSLR with lots of great features for a reasonable price the D750 will fit you well.-----------------UPDATE: (Some people have reported seeing a shadow band at the top of the frame when shooting flares at specific angles. I have not seen this problem with my D750 but Nikon issued an advisory to repair it for free if you happen to see it. Most have not encountered this problem during normal shooting only when they intentionally tried to induce this shadow band. If you like to shoot flares or if you shoot a lot of video you may want to check your body for the problem when you buy it. Personally I don't think this is as big of a problem as oil spots on sensor or left focusing issue but there are a few buyers out there who might be affected by it. Personally I have not seen this problem with three different D750 bodies I used but some others might.)-----------------IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER TO DSLR PHOTOGRAPHY...and you haven't really handled a DSLR before the D750 may be a lot of camera and it may be intimidating with all the buttons menus and dials but it does also have an ""Auto"" mode with some scene modes available that will get you through the first phase of learning how to operate it. I recommend you buy a comprehensive Nikon D750 guide book and use that instead of the Nikon-provided manual. The manual that comes with the camera is far too confusing and it doesn't really teach you anything about DSLR photography. All it does is explain what each function does which is sometimes not enough to make you understand why you need to do something a certain way. Auto and scene modes are nice but if you're buying a camera of this caliber you want to be able to benefit from what it offers which is amazing images when the correct settings are used. Get out of Auto mode and explore M A P and S. You'll be happy you did.IF YOU'RE A NIKON DX SHOOTER...thinking about moving to full frame you currently have three choices at the 24 megapixel low to mid-range price; D600 D610 and D750. The D600 D610 and D750 are all pretty good choices but your decision will heavily depend on how you're going to use the camera and how big of a budget you have.Here are the similarities between them:- They all have 1/4000s max shutter speed.- They all have very similar button controls (the D750 buttons on the left side are a little bit different by including the ""i"" for info button)- All three have a magnificent 24 megapixel sensor with plenty of dynamic range and great high ISO performance (You'd be hard-pressed to see the difference).- All three have two SD card slots and User 1/User 2 function.- All three are similar in size and weight. The D600 and D610 are pretty much identical to each other in that regard.- All three have a built-in flash.- All three have 100% viewfinder coverage.- All three have very similar buffer capacity.- Same 3.2"" screen size (but the D750 screen resolution is slightly better going from 921000 Dots on the D600/D610 to 1229000 Dots on the D750).- They use the same battery.- They all meter with AF AF-S and AI lenses.The basic differences between the D600/D610 and the D750 are:- Price- Is about 10 grams lighter- D750 51 point AF focusing down to -3EV vs. D600/D610 39 point AF focusing down to -1EV in low light.- D750 is slightly lighter and smaller than the D600/D610 although it's barely noticeable.- D750 grip is deeper and slightly longer for a better hold if you have bigger hands.- The ""OK"" button can be reprogrammed to zoom into playback to 100% which is better than having to press the zoom button multiple times to check for sharpness.- Tilting screen on the D750 which is helpful if the camera is mounted on a tripod at lower or higher than eye-level etc.- Highlight-weighed metering (if you want to prevent blown highlights this is a nice function but you can also achieve this on the D600/D610 through matrix metering and setting it to -0.7EV to underexpose just slightly)- Slightly better video options such as being able to change the aperture in live view.- Built in Wi-Fi (You can buy a small external WiFi adapter for the D600/D610 for around $20 to $50).- Better weather-sealing on the D750 touted to be as good as it is on the pro bodies (although the D600/D610 are also weather-sealed well).- Faster FPS (6.5 vs. 6 with the D610 vs. 5.5 with the D600).- Better bracketing options (2 to 5 frames in steps of 2 or 3 EV 2 to 9 frames in steps of 1/3 1/2 2/3 or 1 EV whereas the D600/D610 can only do 2 to 3 frames in steps of 1/3 1/2 2/3 1 or 2 EV). This is beneficial to those who like to create HDR images.- Full HD 1920x1080 at 60 fps whereas the D600/D610 does 60 fps but at max resolution of HD 1280x720.- More Auto flash sync modes.- 1.2 crop mode whereas the D600/D610 have only FX or DX modes.- Better white balance bracketing options (2 to 9 exposures in increments of 1 2 or 3 EV whereas the D600/D610 do 2 or 3 exposures).- The D750 does a better job with in-camera high ISO noise reduction if you like to shoot JPEGs but it can sometimes be at the cost of detail depending on how high a setting you choose.- Native ISO sensitivity on the D750 ranges from ISO 100 to 12800 (options of ISO 50 in Lo-1 up to ISO 25600 in Hi-1 and 51200 in Hi-2 also available) vs. D600/D610 native ISO range going from 100 to 6400 and expandable from ISO 50 to ISO 12800 in Hi-1 and 25600 in Hi-2.To decide whether you should go with a D600 D610 or a D750 you have to ask yourself a few questions:- Do you own any full frame lenses?- How much can you spend?- If you don't have any full frame lenses can your budget accommodate a new quality full frame lens AND a full frame camera?- What will you be shooting and how serious of a photographer are you? Is this just a hobby? Is this just for shooting family events trips etc.? Or do you plan to shoot professionally?- Will you be shooting RAW and putting time into processing your files or do you plan on shooting JPEG only?If you don't have a big budget you don't own any full frame lenses yet and photography is just a hobby a D600/D610 will be more than adequate for the job. It will do at least 85% of what the D750 would do for you. It does a good job at tracking moving objects and it will have no issues with shooting portraitslandscapes or still life. Both of these cameras produce beautiful JPEGs provided you set up your shooting/picture menu correctly.Although the D600/D610 has 12 less AF points the AF is very snappy and accurate in good and in decent light. Also the frame coverage is not much less than on the D750 with its 51 point AF. If you're coming from a D7000 for example the AF on the D600/D610 is quicker and more accurate than it is on the D7000 (at least from my experience).If you have a bigger budget you already own full frame lenses and you're more serious about your photography (ESPECIALLY if you shoot sports fast moving wildlife or in dimly lit venues) the D750 is the one to own. Although the D600 and D610 perform very well (especially in the right hands and with the right settings) the D750 is just a bit better in that regard. If you're shooting for clients and you need to make sure you don't miss any moments as far as focus goes the D750 will provide you with that little extra assurance that the job will get done. The faster FPS faster and more sensitive AF better tracking abilities and great high ISO performance the D750 is more suited toward action.IF YOU ALREADY OWN A D600/D610...and you don't know if you should move to the D750 here's my opinion; The image quality on the D600/D610 and D750 is just too close to call. Yes the D750 is slightly better at high ISOs but in order to make this a worth-while upgrade you'd have to spend most of your time shooting at ISO 12800 and above. Most situations simply do not call for that. Most people will shoot between ISO 100 and 6400. The difference in image quality simply is not worth the extra $1000.00 between the three cameras. I've compared my D610 and D750 high ISO RAW files in Lightroom and I'm just as impressed with the D610 as I am with the D750. According to DxO Mark (if you trust their results) the D600/D610 sensor still scores just slightly above the D750.If you're mostly shooting portraits landscapes still life and light action in decent light the D600/D610 handles that just fine and the D750 will not produce miracles in that regard. The AF is better but not by such a large margin in those conditions that it would warrant an extra $1000.00. It's very low light focus and fast subject tracking where you'll see the biggest difference. If that's not a condition you encounter frequently I don't think it's worth the extra cost.The tilting screen is also not enough to upgrade to the D750 for still shooters unless you're into video in which case the additional video options AND the tilting screen are worth it.SHOULD YOU BUY THE D750?If you have a big budget you really want full frame image quality and you don't mind spending an extra $1000.00 for a D750 buy it over the D600/D610. While the D600/D610 are very capable bodies the little extras and the more sensitive AF of the D750 is just a nice thing to have in a camera. Maybe you won't take advantage of those extra features but if you need them they're going to be there. It's like deciding between a 300HP car and a 350HP car. Both will get you from point A to point B you can break the speed limit with both both are fast and will leave many others in the dust should you feel a drag race is necessary but one will get you there faster if you mash down on the pedal.If you don't shoot super fast subjects and/or in very dim (or rather nearly non-existent) light often you're on a tight budget and you need to use that budget to buy lenses as well the D610 is more than capable. It's an amazing camera and will get you great results no worse than the D750 would. There are some amazing deals on it right now.If you're on a VERY tight budget but you just have to have full frame the D600 is even cheaper than the D610 it is nearly identical to the D610 in every way but... know that you are taking a risk with the dust/oil on sensor issue. While this is something that doesn't affect every D600 there is a chance that you might get one with the problem. It's not a big issue if you're shooting below f/16 personally it didn't affect my everyday shooting but landscape photographers who shoot at narrow apertures might find this a problem when shooting empty skies where dust might be more obvious. Nikon has agreed to clean the sensor of any D600 regardless of warranty (as far as I know) so you do have that reassurance if it should come up but just know that this is a possibility. I loved mine when I had it I was thrilled with it despite experiencing dust but some people may not be as tolerant as I am or as willing to learn to clean their own sensors.SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN BUYING THE D750The D750 does NOT come with a screen protector or a flash hot shoe cover. You can purchase the flash hot shoe cover for less than $5.00. The charger does not come with a cord it's the type that plugs directly into a wall. I imagine you could buy a cord separately if that's something you really wanted but the wall charger works just fine.CONCLUSIONThe D750 is an awesome and enjoyable camera. It has all the great features any photographer would love to have in a single body. The AF performance and image quality are professional-grade and I think any enthusiast hobbyist or even professional would be happy with the results it is capable of producing in the right hands. I think Nikon really did a great job here. Usually I'm forced to say ""great job Nikon but it could have done without this or that flaw"". This time I can honestly say.... good work. You got it right. Please keep it up.",0
DSLR Cameras,B0060MVLXC,Nikon D750 FX-format Digital SLR Camera…,        400 of 413 people found the following review helpful       A professional body disguised in a prosumer shell.  The next great Nikon in the making  October 3  2014By Herman A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've gone through 3x Nikon D700 and 3x Nikon D800 bodies over the past few years. All my bodies have been through a lot and I can pinpoint what's wrong with the D800 and how Nikon failed to capture the essence of the now legendary D700 with the way they danced around not releasing a real successor.I set my expectations super low when I heard about the D750 release and I was throughly unimpressed when I read through the spec sheet - first noticing the consumer level command dial which I would honestly never touch after switching the M the limitation of shutter speed capped at 1/4000 and for them to further cramp the focus points towards the center which is quite inferior to what it was if you ask me.I received the camera today and put out my Df D800 and this new D750 to compare.First thing I noticed is the grip... boy it's lightyears of improvement comparing to the D800 which I struggle to hold on to every time I use it.  The D750 grip is very similar to the D700 and if anything it's actually better.  They now give you enough space to lay your thumb and made a little bulge to improve palm grip. They have also rearranged the battery compartment so that the grip itself is smaller allowing your fingers more surface area to hold the camera.  I know most people wouldn't care as much but when you continue to use the camera over and over this is the type of little things that makes a huge difference.Live view response time is dramatically improved comparing to the D800.  The refresh rate isn't near the Df level which feels instantaneous but it's fast enough; the real difference is how soon your camera allows your input again after taking the first image with live view.  The D800 is so bad that it feels like a bug they never fixed it takes up to a few seconds for your camera to come back to live; whereas the D750 is simply very responsive in this department.The tilt screen actually feels very solid and this makes the D750 a great camera for those who shoot both still and motion.  I've been hoping this feature would make it to the professional bodies and this might just be it.Initial response with image quality is very positive even after living with D800 for the past couple years which spoiled me with the amazing dynamic range.  They somehow seem to have improved that even further with the D750 which I have to say is mind boggling. The slightly lower 24.3 megapixel vs 36 from the D800 is actually a welcoming ""feature"".  I have to say 99% of my pictures don't ever call for a full 36 megapixel so a lower 24.3 which is sufficiently almost all the time will save me so much headache with storage space.  (I have added a total of 10 hard drives over the past 2 years thanks to shooting D800 as my primary cameras)*** updated AF section ***The auto focus performance on the camera is far beyond the D800.  Not sure how well it is in comparison to the D3S and D4 yet but it's at least pretty close to the D700 besides not having the focus point coverage. In low light situation even with my ISO jacked un to 6400 it's focusing just fine; and also when I try to point the camera towards direct sunlight it's still not missing much at all and I can still rely on it.  On a contrary when I put it in live view it's actually failing to focus sometimes which the camera has no problem not using LV to focus.  Strange but so far so good with AF...Instead of CF+SD combo this body actually has 2x SD slots.  It's not a deal breaker but if you're concerned about SD reliability you may want to keep this in mind.The button layout is similar to the consumer level camera but still retains enough similarities to the bigger brothers so the pros wouldn't feel too unfamiliar.*** video portion of the review to come after thorough testings this week ***The new movie settings menu is a very welcome addition which would allow those of us who shoot video much easier access to the functions.  Nikon seems to also have given us more flexibility to customize the buttons for movie mode as well.Wifi is definitely a great addition.  This opens up new ways for us to use our cameras allowing us to instantly extract photos out of the camera and manipulate or distribute them with our cell phones.  I sincerely hope that this will continue to trickle down to the entire Nikon line of products.They stuck with the EN-EL15 so we don't have to buy new batteries - awesome!*** The bad:  AF focus points are cramped... this is a huge set back and I was really hoping this wouldn't happen.  At this point it seems like Nikon is set to designing their future cameras like that which is a step back.*** The maybe:  This isn't a professional line of camera although it feels very good and feels just like the pro bodies but it's not. The omission on 1/8000 shutter speed and the consumer level shooting mode dial is a huge put off for a lot of people but then the above par construction makes up for it.  Now whether this camera is durable enough like its bigger brothers remain to be seen.  But so far I have to say the D800 isn't very durable.  I've got the AF knocked out several times on my bodies in the past without apparent impact already so I'm keeping my fingers crossed hoping they did not cut corners on this one.Conclusion: *** update***  I'll admit that I was skeptical actually very skeptical.  But after using the camera for one whole day on two weddings shooting both still and motion I have to say I actually look forward to using this more than my D800 bodies.  I can't say about the D810 but if I never needed the 36MP I don't see why I should go that route.  The wifi feature works beautifully and it sets the camera apart from the other cameras.  60fps on 1080p HD is quite impressive although I haven't figured out how I would use it.  The high ISO performance is amazing... you will see some lab tests results soon online and I'm sure it won't disappoint.  The grip is amazing and I really cannot stress enough how well it is designed.  Huge props to Nikon on this one finally listening to our complaints for once.In short this is not your D700 replacement but it is probably even more than you had asked for.  It's a slightly more compact D700 with a tilt screen 24 MP wifi still solid construction. The downside I see is minor issues like the layout of the buttons where WB is #2/5 from top down and ISO is in #4 and there is nothing to indicate them other than the writings meaning there are no engravings or anything to help you distinguish what you're pressing when you're not actually looking forcing you to pull the camera away from your face and see what you're pressing and that slows you down.  Movie mode highlight zebra is great but it would be even better if they put in focus peaking.Will I buy it again? Yes!  In fact at the time of this update I have sold both my D800 bodies and switched over to two D750 bodies.  I think every era of cameras there's just one amazing camera that's really worth buying - back in the days it was the Canon 5D 5D-mk2 D700.  Those are the bodies that people always go back to compare to because they set the standard in their times.  The Nikon fans have always been asking for a D700 successor.  This even thou isn't a direct descendent it's definitely worthy to be ranked among one of those very few DSLRs that in time you will go back and compare to and years from now you will be asking Nikon to make a D750 successor.Hope this helps you make your camera purchasing process!",0

December 10  2015By Travis Edwards,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Having used the D300 for years in both personal and professional capacities I was always aggravated by the lack of  low light performance.  Being limited to an ISO of 800 without noticeable noise just wasn't cutting it.Upgrading to the D750 not only gave me the benefit of a full frame sensor but an amazing improvement in low light performance image quality and autofocus performance as well.  I have only had the D750 for a month but I am in love with it.  The combination of this body my nifty fifty and my 85 1.8 are inseparable,1
DSLR Cameras,B0060MVLXC,Nikon D750 FX-format Digital SLR Camera…,        18 of 18 people found the following review helpful       Professional camera features at a semi-pro cost  January 15  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Oh my gosh this camera. I'm coming from using a Nikon D700 and I can tell you this is a nice step up all around from that old workhorse. The low light performance is spectacular and the noise is very polite even at ISO 12800. I only needed to take the noise reduction/luminance smoothing up to 50 in Lightroom to clear it up at for the pictures shot at ISO 12800 vs having to take it up to 75 with the D700 after shooting at ISO 3200. I took it out to photograph an accident that happened last night (see pic) and I was using a 70-300mm f4.5/5.6 Nikon lens @ 300mm and I didn't have a tripod handy so I kept the shutter speed above 1/30 sec and set the ISO to 12800 and the pictures came out pretty clear and the noise was very manageable. This thing owns the night (see church pic). I tried to get that shot earlier this year and I could never get the focus right. This camera just nailed it right away and I could leave the middle of the road sooner (always a plus). I'm big into astro-photography and also not having to use flash in indoor social situations and this camera delivers. AWB is pretty spot on as well with astro shots being the only issue. Video quality recording is something the D700 was lacking and I am pleased that I now own a 1080p 60fps camcorder as well. The microphone doesn't like being too close to a baby grand piano but that is to be expected. All other videos have been just fine. All in all I'm very pleased with this camera's performance and I look forward to a long a prosperous relationship with it.,1

Getting ready to sell my Sony A99.  Love that camera (especially the ability to dial in the exact desired exposure before taking a shot thanks to the EVF) but the D750 has much more control to offer.  Auto ISO Exposure Bracketing and Timer controls are among the top features that I now enjoy much more control over.  The instant on and battery life along with the ability to immediately download a jpg directly from the camera and injected into social media is another major benefit.  Live view operation has been a major disappointment with a serious lag time between shots and it often struggles to focus (85 f1.8 lens).  The Wifi app is a disappointment as well essentially only useful for downloading images and very basic live view image capture.  Will be getting the CamRanger and see how that is.So it's like learning to shoot all over again.  Defintely a bit more challenging to get the exposure right since you don't have a preview in the viewfinder as you are shooting but I feel it will just make me a stronger photographer for it.Overall I am thoroughly impressed with this camera.  There are many other things I enjoy but feel they are mainly personal taste such as size and weight.  There was no other Nikon model that interested me enough to make a switch before this one.  It fits me perfectly.  Chose it over the 5DM3 which I was poised to get.  Size weight and feel were a big part in that decision.It can be tough to decide where to put your money.  Best advice is to make sure you know what is most important to you and don't settle on those.  If you are not sure buy a low end camera from the manufacturer that appeals most to you and move up when you have a solid understanding of what you need for daily shooting.,1

Burke,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am officially in love with my new camera. Had a Nikon D300 for years. There is simply no reason to buy up to the D810. The pictures are phenomenal. Higher fps than the 810. And I'm finding the tilt screen VERY useful. Just took photos of puppies. The tilt screen lets me get the camera down to face level. For taking food shots the tilt screen lets me raise the camera up over my head to get top down pictures of food. But what I really love is the increased ISO sensitivity! Light too low? Boost the ISO and you can use faster shutter speeds. The dual card slots let me shoot Raw in slot one and jpg in slot two. Why is this so wonderful? Because I also use my camera for everyday photos. With the Wifi capability I can send some jpg shots to Instagram or to a friend and then I still have my Raw photos for editing if I choose. I use 128Mb cards in each slot. I'm buying new lenses BUT I can still use some of my really good DX lenses with it - it automatically switches to DX mode when I put the older lens on.  As for the difference between 24mp pictures and D810's 36mp photos - 90% of photographers will NEVER need that much resolution. Honestly. Unless you're blowing up pictures to use as wall murals you'll never miss the higher resolution. And the lower fps speed on the 810 is much more of a loss.,0
DSLR Cameras,B0060MVLXC,Nikon D750 FX-format Digital SLR Camera…,        20 of 21 people found the following review helpful       Well worth the investment and the wait!  April 25  2015By BostwickBooks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have owned a number of SLR and D-SLR cameras and have found a perfect match to my needs in the Nikon D750.I won't get into a comparison of brands - each brand has its merits. I chose the Nikon family because many of my original film SLRs were Nikon and I wanted to get even more use out of my lenses. My first Nikon D-SLR was the D90 followed by the D7100.  I loved both the D7100 even more so (which is fair given that it had several upgrades to the D90).The D750 is everything I've been waiting for. For a full-frame camera it is very reasonably-priced. The photo quality is excellent - with good lenses the images are sharp and the colours are beautiful and accurate.  Low-light photography is amazing - I am continually stunned at how sensitive the sensor is and how minimal the noise is at high ISOs.  I've used the camera for everything from fast-moving action shots (sports auto-racing) to meteor showers and everything in between including portraits and nature photography.  Images enlarged to poster size retain their sharpness and detail.I have greatly enjoyed the photo quality of the D7100 - it's a great DX camera that I highly recommend if you're looking for DX. Sorry you can't have mine because I'm keeping it!:)  I was eager to do some side-by-side comparisons with the D750.  Using the same lens I took photos with each camera and while pleased with the results of each the photos from the D750 were exceptional.  Much of the difference is likely due to the full-frame sensor and simply having so much more image to work with but I was also impressed with the outstanding clarity in low-light conditions which is surely a result of the updated CMOS.  I took some ambient outdoor photos during the last full moon using a tripod and was stunned by the detail in the D750 images.  And the photos of the full moon itself were astounding - they were so clear and detailed I wouldn't have been surprised to see an astronaut waving to me. :)The D750 has many features I've been longing for.- the tilt LCD is fantastic. I sometimes shoot using a monopod to get an angle above people's heads and the tilt LCD allows me to see what I'm getting. I recommend a wireless remote (Nikon or the AmazonBasics) or Nikon MC-DC2 remote release cord.- the built-in Wi-Fi has made it infinitely easier to go from camera to smartphone/tablet without needing to pull SD cards out of the camera and use a computer.  With the Nikon WMU app on your smartphone or tablet it takes only seconds to transfer images that you can then further proof email or post to social media.  I've transferred images in 1-2 seconds each.  You can also take photos on the D750 from your smartphone or tablet. (Be sure you have a fully charged battery to get the most out of the experience so you can have Live View appear on your device.)  I recently shot photos for a competitive event and people were amazed at both the quality and the speed of the photos I was posting to Twitter. Within seconds of taking a photo on the D750 I could have the image posted to social media.- Speed! 6.5 fps can capture a lot of action especially combined with the advanced auto focus features. I've been able to capture some amazing moments.- Face recognition- HD video is really fun and the quality is amazing! Even though the camera has reasonably good autofocus for video I do recommend using manual focus if only to avoid the noise form the auto-focus (if you're using an external microphone which I recommend this isn't as much of a consideration).  Most of the video I've taken has been in inherently noisy locations so the autofocus noise is barely discernible and can be easily removed in post-processing if desired.- Dual memory card slots are super convenient! I got spoiled by this feature in the D7100 and love that I can set it up so that raw goes on one card and JPEG on the other or have an automatic backup or even set it up for overflow so I never have to worry about filling up a card right before that vital shot.~ A couple of additional notes ~LENSES: Like many photographers I tend to find that lenses can have a greater impact on the quality of my photographs than the camera itself. It had been my intention to purchase a full-frame camera ultimately so I ensured that my lenses were FX even when I had DX cameras. This made the eventual upgrade to FX a much easier transition because I had lenses to choose from. (The DX lenses will work on the FX cameras but the sensor will only shoot as though it were DX so it's not taking full advantage of the FX sensor. The FX lenses work on the DX cameras so it's a good long-term strategy to invest in FX lenses even if you have DX bodies.) Invest in the best possible lens you can afford even if it may mean waiting to get a better camera body later.RAW/NEF:  the raw (NEF) format has been updated so you'll need to get an update to your image-processing software. (I use Adobe Photoshop CC and the current update is able to correctly process the NEF format.)MEMORY CARDS: Be sure to get high quality memory cards that have a Class 10 rating. This is the write speed. Given how fast you can take photos and video with this camera you'll appreciate having memory card that keep up. My personal favourites are SanDisk Extreme Pro (32GB or 64GB) that have a write speed of 95MB/s. They are also shockproof and waterproof.""FLARE"" - you may have seen reviews where people mention a problem with flare. Although this seems to have affected a very very small percentage of the original D750 and only under very specific conditions Nikon has made a correction so any D750 you buy now will not have an issue. If you happen across an older one Nikon will fix it.",0

I occasionally do professional shoots (i.e. graduation engagement shoots etc.).  I started with D60 and quickly moved to D3100 but was looking to make the leap to FX camera.  Had played with D7000/7100 and decided instead for the D750... and I am glad I did.  To be honest compared to my entry level DSLR (D60) this was a big change but this camera continues to have that Nikon feel.  Straight out of the box you know where the buttons and menus are.  It was easy to pick up.  The images I am producing are fantastic and have been very pleased with the prints.  Overall I would highly recommend this body to anyone looking to make the leap to FX camera or a professional looking for a solid back up.",1

December 21  2015By Greenman NC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A nice step up from my D7000 and before that a D5000.  Great low light performance color rendition hand feel controls a huge boost in MP's...I cant think of one negative thing to say about it.  Well actually I did discover that I need to get Lightroom  Creative Cloud as Photoshop does not support the raw images from the D750.  That was a bummer initially but Lightroom has so much more to offer than Photoshop so that was a good move looking back. I did a lot of homework before I made the jump to a Full Frame.... yes I lost $ on some lenses that would not be compatible but dont regret my decision at all. The photo's that I have taken are far superior to the D7000.  I did also look at the D7200 and D610 but decided that this one is a better choice(although the D7200 was close I had a hankering for a full frame and the D610 was not much less $$ than this one) for what I feel would be the best fit for my photographic needs.  Everyone's needs are different mine were for Landscape photographyLow light photography as well as some macro and a little wildlife photography.  I wanted to take some great photo's but (sometimes) do not feel the need to get all anal about it.  I do occasionally suffer from gear acquisition phobiaMy best source of photography information comes from a web site known as Photography Life.  They have done a wonderful job of not only giving great reviews on this camera and lens they also have great tips on photography as well.  This lens by the way Rocks !  Its replaced my Nikon 18-200 as a walk around (DX does not work well on FX bodies).  I love the extra f stops and by cropping I dont really feel sad about the loss of reach either.,0

November 2  2014By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've been wanting to upgrade to a full-frame from my D7000 for a while now and the D750 hit all the marks.  Light fast fps good size buffer good ISO double SD cards Wi-Fi tilt screen and amazing autofocus.  On the latter I could not believe that it was able to focus on my son Halloween night while he was trick-or-treating.  I could barely see through the viewfinder that night but it was able to focus on him 90% of the time.Now I agree with others that Nikon could have included more pro finishes.  I mean come on who is going to spend over $2000 on a DLSR and use the JPEG “special effects” mode.  People do not buy nice cameras for their post-processing features.  As well the 4000 shutter speed limit was a concern at first but after searching from my Lightroom catalog I could only find 5 shoots in the last two years where I took anything above that speed with my D7000.In any case all-in-all it’s an amazing camera.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01I3LNMAM,Fujifilm X-T2 Mirrorless Digital…,        161 of 162 people found the following review helpful       My absolute favorite camera (sorry  Canon)  October 22  2016By Kevin Kleitches,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"First off this is (according to my failing memory) the only Amazon review I've ever felt compelled to write so that should give you a pretty good idea on just how amazing this camera is.Quick backstory: I've only been shooting for a couple of years. In 2014 I picked up my first DSLR a Canon T3i. Within a few months I graduated to the Canon 6D and a year or so later the 5D Mark III. Canon has served me well over the years and I've been fortunate enough to make a solid side-income from this hobby-turned-profession. I wouldn't be writing this review right now let alone know what a mirrorless camera is if it weren't for my friend Jahns. We made plans to shoot some street photography one day and he showed up with a small little camera that looked more like a point-and-shoot rather than a DSLR. Turns out it was neither. It was the Sony a7 and I quickly became enamored with its convenient portability and nifty features like its electronic viewfinder focus peaking and advanced focus system. Suddenly it became clear: mirrorless was the future. I knew I had some research to do.I had my work cut out for me. There are plenty of mirrorless options on the market so deciding which one I wanted proved to be a difficult task. Initially I thought my choice was clear: The Sony a7rII. It boasted everything I would ever need in a camera. But the price tag ($3198) was hefty and I started to question whether I really needed all those megapixels. Surely there was a more affordable alternative. Enter the Fuji XT-2. I'm actually not sure how I stumbled upon this marvel of a machine but I'm so glad I did. After reading glowing review after glowing review about the X-series it became obvious the XT-2 was for me. So I ordered it.Five Reasons Why I'm in Love with This Camera:1) PortabilityThis camera along with the 35mm f/2 (the only lens I have for it) weighs 1.5 pounds. That's including the battery and lens hood. The Canon 5D Mark III with the 85mm f/1.2 weighs well over three times that much. The difference in weight is not just noticeable it's dramatic. You can wear it around your neck or slung over your shoulder and you'll barely feel it.2) Superior focus system""Superior to what?"" you might be asking. While I don't know if the XT-2's focus system beats out other mirrorless cameras (it might I just haven't done the research) I can say with certainty that it's light years ahead of any DSLR I've shot with. DSLR cameras use what's called phase detection autofocus while mirrorless systems use what's called contrast detection autofocus. What's the difference? Phase detection is generally a little faster but it has one huge drawback: it can be pretty inaccurate. With contrast detection on the other hand the camera looks at the point on the sensor that's supposed to be in focus and adjusts the lens accordingly until everything looks sharp. Since getting the XT-2 my ""throw-away"" rate has been cut down significantly. So many images are in focus and if they aren't it's generally because I'm not shooting at a fast enough shutter speed.3) Articulating ScreenIf you're a street photographer you're going to be in absolute heaven. This camera is already discrete with its small form factor but when you couple that with the ability to pull out the LCD screen you have the superpower of going around virtually unnoticed. Using live view I can look down at my camera's LCD screen that's flipped up and focus more on composing my shot rather than worrying about if people are noticing me. This means capturing more real-life moments and less time planning out *how* you're going to capture those moments.4) Film SimulationThe film simulations are a big part of what swayed me to Fuji instead of Sony. And they definitely do not disappoint. I'm particularly fond of the ""Classic Chrome"" simulation; its soft and muted tones makes images so pleasing to look at. I generally will color correct images on my own but I've been surprised at how many images are shareable right out of the camera. Especially for random outings and trips this is such a welcome feature. No longer do you have to spend hours culling and editing every individual shot.One other thing to note about the film simulations: they can be applied to video too although I haven't thoroughly tested this yet. It's nice to know that you can choose to forgo color grading if you're happy with what the simulation gives you. (Fuji also has a flat video profile called F-log though I think that can only be utilized when using an external 4k recorder.)5) Sex AppealLooks aren't everything but they sure do help and the XT-2 is a damn sexy beast. With its three dials on the top of the body it deceives many into thinking it's a film camera. That is until they see the LCD screen or hear the sound of its delicious (and silent!) mechanical shutter. The XT-2 is the perfect marriage of nostalgia and technology and is sure to be a conversation piece among friends and strangers alike.The Bottom Line: No piece of gear will make you a better photographer on its own but this camera certainly makes shooting hella fun. If you're considering making the leap from a DSLR to mirrorless this is a fine choice. Get it! You won't regret it. :)I hope you all find this review helpful.

October 19  2016By Vancouver Tom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been reading the reviews about some of the mirrorless cameras for quite a while.  I was mildly interested but I had a great Canon 6D that took wonderful photos and video.  Then I photographed my brother in law's wedding a few weeks ago and felt the weight of my Canon 6D and 24-105mm L lens start to bother me.  I had a small kit with me and left my bag and other lenses in the car preferring to work light this time.  So much for that...When I returned home I started looking at smaller DSLRs and read a few reviews on the Fuji X-T2.  The reviews seemed like they were written by the Fujifilm marketing department.  But there were many reviews praising the X-T2 even though it had recently become available.So I took a chance and ordered the X-T2 with XF 18-55mm lens.  It did take a bit of owner's manual study to get used to the menu layout and the different controls.  But when I started taking photos and examined the sharpness and fantastic color I became a believer!  Wow! This was the best camera since my film days when I used to shoot Fujichrome Velvia film.Since this is the initial release of this model there are a few things that I expect to see changed in a firmware release.  But it works as is perfectly for me.  I love shooting it and it doesn't seem to weigh much compared to the old Canon 6D.  To me this makes vacation and street photography fun again.I also have the XF 10-14 f4 XF 35mm f2 WR and the Rokinon 12mm F2 lenses.  They are all exceedingly sharp with excellent color.,1

I'm switching over from a Nikon D7000 which I've got some great shots out of but I'm really liking this camera so far and the auto focus is beating the pants off the D7000.  I'm not necessarily talking about the speed as I haven't shot any sports/fast moving subjects yet but the accuracy.  I would sometimes have to mess with auto focus fine tuning on the Nikon with different lenses but this X-T2 is pinpoint accurate on 98% of the 500 shots or so that I've taken so far.This being my first Fujifilm camera I am greatly appreciating the approach.  They've just set up the buttons and everything really well and intuitively.  You can take 90% of your pictures without reading the manual but I'd still recommend reading it.  They've included sooo much functionality in this camera that you will have to glean the intricacies from the manual to get that last 10%.  For example I really like being able to change focus manually once I've held the shutter button halfway down to autofocus but this option is something you'll have to find in the menu to turn on (at least on the 56mm lens; for push-pull manual focus lenses like the 16mm this wouldn't be necessary).Picture quality is excellent and I'm really digging the jpeg film simulations.  I think I could get away with mostly shooting in jpeg.  However I will most likely be shooting in RAW+JPEG so I can have more control for the really special shots I might end up getting.  That being said I seriously need to upgrade to some higher speed memory cards and I'd recommend you invest in these too especially if you're going to be shooting any video...at all.So far this camera has been a joy to use and I am excited to pick it up.  I've attached some photos taken with 56mm and 16mm lenses.  They are film sims straight out of the camera with some cropping done prior to uploading.,1

November 20  2016By Ataraxia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Just a dream of a camera. Slightly larger than micro four thirds premium bodies of Olympus or Panasonic and slightly smaller than Sony's A7 series of full frame cameras. The camera feels like a tool that you will want to go out and shoot with. Control layout and its ergonomics are superb while the output of the files are astounding. No more worries about the issues with X Series cameras with poor autofocus greatly improved continuous autofocus and the speed has vastly improved. Someone that has shot with mirrorless for years trying micro four thirds in many iterations aps-c mirrorless systems as well as the Sony mirrorless full frames Fuji continues to draw me in. The Fuji X-T2 is a versitile piece of grear that will be your go to all purpose camera. I extensively do street and travel photography where it's just a joy to use. Wifi works well for Instagram though the files do take a bit of time to transfer. Instagram: thedharmalife,0

One thing I wanted to let you all know is that you see any weirdness (for example moving waves in the video) with the 18-55 mm lens or other lenses make sure to UPGRADE the FIRMWARE on the LENS to the latest available at Fuji site. I would upgrade the Firmware on the lens even if you do not see any problems at the moment as your IS may not work optimally. The camera does not have Firmware upgrade as of the writing of this review. Check all of your lenses!The many great qualities of this camera outweigh  the few things that need improvement. Things I would have liked to see for video is the headphone jack to be on the camera and not on the grip. But maybe they did that because the battery  life is very short for video that you pretty much will have to use the grip. But still.  The shooting switch selector (video-BKT-L-H-S...) is hard to use.,0

November 15  2016By RAFAEL POGGI,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am an enthusiast photographer interested in macro and nature photography in general. The first camera I used was a Nikon D300 with the 18-200mm. After some years decided to have a new camera and made a lot of internet research and I mean A LOT. I wanted the best quality images I could get that my wallet could afford. I started to see full frame bodies as an option but price was a restrictive issue considering the whole package including good glass for a macro a wide angle and a telephoto. While “surfing” I started to read about Fujifilm there were interesting opinions about the great image quality and the amazing color rendering they produce but not so many about its autofocus. Besides this everything else was somehow aligned with my requirements. Then the X-T1 was announce and immediately grab my attention for the autofocus speed upgrade they introduced in this model and maybe because of my DSLR background that it is reassembled on this lineup finally I jumped to the Fujifilm with the X-T1. Really a new hole dimension on image quality and color rendering. Loved the camera and after a couple of years later saw myself fully committed to this Fuji ecosystem having great glass for all my interests.Then the X-T2 was announced with a bigger sensor better autofocus better ISO better shutter speed with a very useful focus stick selector double memory card slots grip with 2 additional batteries and more. I immediately sold the X-T1 in order to have cash and order the X-T2 that I have for a couple of months now. The bigger knobs are also a great addition such a pleasure to use the dials and I did not start using film cameras it just make more sense than Aperture and Shutter priority.The Cons still waiting for good lighting system still waiting for a better macro lens (picture of butterfly taken with the Zeiss 50 f/2.8) no touchscreen yet still pricy software support still behind canikon still waiting for tethering support.(Picture of butterfly taken with the Carl Zeiss 50mm f/2.8 the toucan with the XF 100-400).,1

It started with the X100S which I absolutely loved!  I then bought an X-T1 and a bunch of lenses and ditched my Canon gear.  The X100S was replaced with an X100T and two months ago the X-T2 was added to the stable.  I still love the X-T1 but it has now been relegated to backup in case there is an issue with the X-T2 when shooting professionally.The good....BUILD QUALITYThe X-T1 compared to the X-T2 seems like a beta version of the camera at least in terms of build quality.  The build quality on the X-T2 is magnificent.  The dials feel much more solid and the fact that you can lock them down is a big improvement over the dials on the X-T1.  Even the doors on the side for the card reader and the ports are more solid than the X-T1.DUAL CARD SLOTHooray!  Now I can shoot both RAW/JPEG Continuous or backup.  I shoot RAW and JPEG but it is nice to know if I wanted to shoot continuous I can fill one card before the camera starts writing to the other card.  If I was only shooting RAW and needed a backup I am covered!  Never had a card fail on me yet...but it is nice to know I am covered if one does fail.JOYSTICKThe joystick is the single best feature Fuji has introduced.  It took a while to get used to not hitting the directional pad to change the focus point.  Once I got used to the joystick it has become a pleasure to use.  If the X100F gets the joystick I may have to upgrade from the T.AUTOFOCUSThe autofocus runs circles around the X-T1.  The custom settings make shooting action a breeze!  I am still astounded by how well the continuous auto focus performs.5 STOP EXPOSURE COMPENSATIONSet the exposure compensation to ""C"" and you can get two more stops than the X-T1.2 STOP EXPOSURE BRACKETINGPerfect for my needs.  The X-T1 has 1 stop exposure bracketing which was pretty worthless for me when I shoot real estate.  I prefer to shoot interiors with off camera lights.  Expose for the windows and fill the room with artificial light.  Some assignments there are too many reflective surfaces and exposure bracketing comes into play.  In this scenario for my needs 2 stops works fine.MICRO USB CHARGINGLove this feature on the X100T and it is welcome on the X-T2.  When traveling I prefer to charge the battery in camera rather than bringing the charger along.  I usually carry a few extra batteries with me...as long as I can charge one battery in camera at night I am good to go.24MP X-Trans CMOS III sensorThe new sensor is absolutely fantastic!4K videoI never shot video with any of my Fuji cameras.  After testing out the 4K video capabilities that has changed.  The video quality is perfect for my needs...quite stunning!The bad...So far my only complaint is the WIFI has been a bit spotty.  I have had some trouble connecting the camera to my iPhone 6.  I have never had a problem with the X-T1.  I am not sure if this is an app issue or perhaps a firmware fix.  I have managed to connect my camera to phone every time but more often than not is has taken me multiple attempts.That is really about it in terms of bad.  If you are thinking about this camera do not hesitate...buy it...it is FANTASTIC!!!!!",1

I've been following Fujifilm for some time and just knew this was the time to make the move (out of respect for the camera systems I've used before I won't mention them and they served me well in the past). Between the reasonably priced lenses the great picture/image quality and finally the ease of use of this camera is just outstanding. The fact that I've been following photographers on instagram that are fujifilm users just solidified the X-T2 was the one to jump in with. And shooting both RAW and jpeg at the same time on two separate cards gives me some peace of mind that card failure won't lose all my photos (happened to me once and lost some great photos).I did not get the kit lens. I'm either wide angle landscape street or close up action photography from a distance (think safari in Africa here where I can be easily a kilometer away from the animals I'm photographing).A couple of my notes. I need geo tagging of photographs so got the Fujifilm Camera Remote app for my Android and that seems to be working (update: nope it only records initial position. Had to get another android app that records GPS and then integrate that into photos in LR. And even that is not accurate sigh). The camera even flashes a red icon (had to look it up) that told me the geotagging data was stale (this was after getting home and downloading some photos). I also transferred a few photos to my Android for my wife (she needed some photos for a meeting) which was a total breeze. [edit Oct 18 2016] I've since converted to using a gps logger app on my Android and marrying the track data to the photos in Lightroom.One annoyance was constantly hunting for the ""wireless communications"" setting (in order to use the Android app for geotagging) which was X-T2 menu button then left down down down then right down down down down down... you get the picture. I replaced the white balance function button to be wireless communication as my kind of photography doesn't mess with the white balance as much as I need geotagging. I put the phone into geotagging mode and I'm set. What I'm still not clear on is if I need to leave the app running on the phone. I do and I put the phone screen to sleep.Speaking of function buttons I love how these interact with the camera and can even override the manual dials (for like the AF setting). The various film modes is also nice and since I also do a lot of B&W the Archos setting is going to be a frequent switch for me. And it is fairly easy to switch button functions so I suspect I may be customizing the buttons as I gain more experience with the X-T2.I started with the 18-135mm lens. I'll probably get a couple of primes for street photography and landscapes then find something for truly long distance photography (definitely before my next safari trip).I'm also going to get the grip. When it comes to action/sports I can see having the extra boost in shots being a potential winner for me getting that one shot I need. And when I'm on an all day shoot it will certainly not hurt having the extra battery power in the grip. [Edit Oct 18 2016 Got the grip and loving it. It does not come with batteries so order those too. But the grip makes this camera last longer too. I was surprised how quickly the camera ran out of battery juice just in a few hours of shooting].The fact that AF can be locked and override autofocus was also a draw for me. [edit Oct 18 2016 in AF+MF you can use the manual focus ring to adjust focus which is useful in macro mode if the camera is focusing on the wrong part of the frame. ]Operation wise this camera rocks. I have not noticed any lag in any operation I've played with (wireless seems a little slower than it should be but I don't know if that is the Android app or the X-T2 or the combination of the two). Auto focus is not only fast but the shutter button to photo is near instantaneous. And I love the electronic viewfinder. LCD panels on the back are all nice and fine up until I can't see diddly because the sun is in the wrong spot and no manner of mucking with the screen position helps me see what is in the viewfinder. Being able to put my eye (wearing my glasses) right up there and compose and shoot is priceless.The manual dial locks are great as I am the kind of photographer than spins dials unintentionally because I am clumsy. The one dial that doesn't lock I've already managed to turn from zero.The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the camera neck strap. I may reuse an older longer strap as I like my camera to hang further down than my midsection. [edit ended up with BlackRapid R-sport strap]",0

Hansen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I’ve been waiting awhile to post a review of the Fuji XT2. I received it from Amazon mid Sept. and have been using it since. I do mostly flowers and travel photo/video and make BluRay videos of them using Apples Final Cut Pro. In Hawaii I did photo comparisons of my Canon 5DIII with all L lenses and the Fuji. The Fuji with its stock 18-55 lens beat the Canon hands down. The images were sharper with better colors (standard setting). In the Vivid mode the colors were remarkable. I think the difference in sharpness is due to the lack of an Optical Low Pass Filter. Traveling with the Fuji system vs. the Canon is so much easier due to size and weight.For the video side of things I have been using a Canon HF G30 camcorder shooting 1080 59.9P. I just did a comparison of the cam and the Fuji at 1080P. I shot extremely low light to check the noise level and daylight for color saturation and clarity of image. Again the Fuji shined much less noise in low light and sharper images with better colors in daylight. I haven’t tried 4K since all my videos are 1080P BluRay. One drawback to the Fuji is that shooting 1080P you’re limited to 15 minutes per clip unless you attach the battery grip with extra batteries. I never used the 5DIII for Video since it won’t auto focus as you are shooting. Speaking of auto focusing the Canon HF G30 does a little better job of staying on focus as the subject moves around. Also the built in mic is really good on the G30 whereas the built in on the Fuji is “muddy”. You really need a good external mic with the Fuji.All things considered the Fuji XT2 is a remarkable achievement at a bargain price. I have since purchased the 55-200 and the 10-24. They are also great!Henrik Hansen DDS,0
DSLR Cameras,B0040JHVCC,Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        18 of 18 people found the following review helpful       A wonderful camera for graduates of the Rebel line  July 15  2013By etcwhatever,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm an experienced amateur photographer who does professional video work.  Last year I purchased a Rebel T3i to use for both photography and video.  After doing some research I decided that the T3i was probably the best value in DSLR video and I was (and still am) very happy with that camera.  However the recent price drops on the 60D (due to the announcement of the 70D) inspired me to trade in my T3i and upgrade from the ""Rebel"" line of DSLRs.  I'm incredibly happy I did so and would whole-heartedly recommend the 60D to anyone serious about photography or DSLR video.It's important to remember that the 60D has the exact same cropped sensor as the T2i T3i T4i and T5i Rebel cameras.  That means that the quality of photos and videos produced by the cameras will be virtually identical – and very good.  In the right hands any one of those cameras can capture stunning photos and HD video.  The difference is largely in the quality and layout of the body as well as the smarter faster focusing system in the 60D.  The 60D feels great in the hands and – although it isn't advertised – there is apparently much better weather-sealing in the 60D than there is in the Rebels.  It has an articulating LCD screen like the T3i (a real plus for video work) but it lacks the touch functionality of the T4i and T5i.Where the 60D really shines is in its manual controls.  Instead of having to hunt through menus or use combo-button presses the 60D puts a ton of controls right at your fingertips.  The buttons are laid out in a fairly logical way and I became familiar with the workings of the camera pretty quickly.  The 60D is a camera that really wants to be used in ""manual"" mode.  If you're the kind of photographer that sticks mostly to automatic settings – which is fine! – this might not be the camera for you.I actually love having the digital readout on the top of the camera which displays the aperture shutter speed ISO and more.  Having that info on the top of the camera means that the rear LCD screen can remain off until you want to use the menus check the electronic level (which is kind of rad) or review your pics.  This saves battery life (at least in photo mode) and is great for sunny conditions that make LCD screens tough to see.  Speaking of battery life the 60D uses higher capacity batteries than the Rebel line.  They're a little heavier and a little pricier but at nearly double the battery life this is well worth it.I have a few nitpicks with the camera although nothing very substantial.  It lacks some of the features particularly for video introduced into some of the more recent Rebels.  It doesn't have electronic video zoom (introduced in the T3i) and it can't autofocus during video recording (introduced in the T4i).  As I mentioned earlier the LCD screen is touch-free.  Probably my biggest gripe is that it is weirdly inconvenient to switch the camera from photo-mode to video-mode.  Video mode is down at the very bottom of the mode dial below all the ""creative"" modes (Sports!  Face!  Flower!) that I frankly wish weren't even there.  Going from ""M"" manual photo mode to video mode requires you to depress the dial lock and turn the thing almost completely around.  The T4i switches into video mode from the power switch instead of the mode dial which just makes so much more sense.  It's a tiny gripe but a persistent one.  I also desperately wish that Canon would make a headphone jack standard issue on their video-equipped DSLRs for audio monitoring but this is apparently wishful thinking.  There's one on the 5D Mark III but right now that's five times the price of the 60D.Going from the T3i to the 60D has felt like switching from a consumer-grade camera to a professional one.  While I don't expect it to capture drastically better images it has absolutely encouraged me to take ownership of the camera's manual controls and become a better more knowledgeable photographer.  Now that the 60D's successor the 70D has been announced I'm sure that many people are wondering if the 60D is still worth it.  The 70D will have an improved sensor (the first new Canon ASP-C sensor in years) and more video features such as autofocus and digital zoom (still no headphone jack though).  However the 70D will also sell for around double what the 60D is currently selling for.  As far as I'm concerned as a photographer and video user on a budget that means that there has never been a better time to pick up a 60D.",0

I say that because if it is your first you will not be comparing the control layout with your old XXD or XXXD and that seems to be an issue with some.Most of my shooting is in M or Av mode. I find the controls easy to work with and use the top LED and control buttons almost exclusively but now and then I'll use the q-menu. Over all I find the controls easy to use.The 18-200 kit lens is useful for outdoor shooting but for indoor stuff you will want a better prime. I went with an older version of the ""nifty fifty"" with the metal mount and range meter. Since this is a crop sensor camera a 50mm lens behaves like an 80mm so I find myself needing to back away from my subject often. I think a prime in the 20-30mm range and f/1.4 would be useful in a lot of situations. In general you should determine why you are buying the camera. If you want to take lots of outdoor shots (birds wildlife etc) get the body only and buy a nice 300M zoom. If you are going to take lots of indoor shots (family gatherings baby etc) get the body only and a wide aperture prime in the 20-50MM range (a wide aperture lets more light in so you don't need a flash as often and yields that nice soft focus ""bokeh"" effect). If you want to be ready to shoot a variety of situations right out of the box and don't mind using the flash indoors then pick a kit lens and go with it. I would not recommend the 18-55 kit lens though...you will bump against its limitations very quickly even if you are a beginner like me.Video on this thing is amazing and I didn't even consider that when I bought the camera! Beware file size though. 2 minutes of 1080 @ 30FPS left me with an 800+meg .mov file. I think there is a 4 GB limit on video file size so figure you will get 5 minutes of continuous shooting at that definition and frame rate. That will be enough for most applications unless you are filming a wedding or childbirth and don't want to stop shooting in which case you could film at 720p or standard definition.Playback through the included cable is so so so get yourself a mini HDMI to HDMI cable on Amazon or Monoprice (should cost $5-$10) and prepare yourself to be amazed by the resolution and image quality. I would also recommend a program called Any Video Converter which enables you to change the resolution and format of your video to suit different hardware (iphones droids youtube etc). Imagine uploading a 4GB file to YouTube for example. You can download the program for free and then pay $40 bucks to be able to use the full menu set.The only negative about this camera is that the auto focus in video mode and live view mode is borderline useless. In live view mode it is so slow that everyone else would have got the shot with their point and shoot cameras before the 60D settles down and takes the picture. As for Video I don't think AF works once you start shooting so if you zoom or your subject moves you have to stay on top of it. I don't shoot in live view mode and I am getting the hang of manual focus during Video (it is actually a creative outlet) so I'm fine with these shortcomings. From what I can tell they are software based and related to the video codec...so it is possible that a firmware upgrade will address these issues.",0

It may not be the Canon 6d or 5Dm2 I would have preferred but overall it worked very well. Since it's purchase this camera became my primary camera which I have used for everything from weddings  portraits concerts (mostly concerts) and the occasional autocross events.A quick disclaimer I do not shot the autofocus very often as many of my favorite lenses are all manual but on the lenses I do use it with (55 - 250 / 50 1.8 ) it does the job just fine. It is not incredibly quick by todays standards but there is no reason someone couldn't get great images with this camera at just about any type of event. I would describe the iso performance the same way. It is good I have no problems pushing upwards of 4000iso. It will produce a good amount of grain but is still useable in my opinion. That being said it seems most cameras can give similar results if not better nowadays.The lens selection for this camera as with any canon is amazing and is one of the main reasons people buy into the system. It handles great and the lcd and such work as one would expect. In the end this camera still a good option for someone that doesn't have the money to go for one of canons full frame bodies. This camera does have competition even in canons line up though. If seriously considering this camera I would suggest looking into a canon 70d. It may be a bit more expensive but will be quick to autofocus and have newer features. But if you find a 60d for a good price I would say go for it as it is a good camera.,0
DSLR Cameras,B0040JHVCC,Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Canon 60D   a truly Magnificent Camera  a True Super Rebel  April 4  2013By Roger James Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I think the Canon 60d is a magnificent camera. It takes great images in even the most difficult settings. It has a wonderful grip which makes it very comfortable and secure to hold.  It does not weigh too much with the basic 18-55 kit lens but with longer zooms it is a handful.  It focuses very quickly stores the image quickly on a high speed SD card (you buy) The high speed capture allows 5 shots per second.  The many options available make even the most difficult to take images possible.  I rated this camera 5 stars because it is a true 5 star super Rebel camera that has everything any non pro could ever want. It is missing some of the great new features that have been added to the Canon T4i and newer Canon T5i like the fabulous touch screen LCD.You do get a full user manual unlike the standard rebels. This is very helpful and it is small enough to carry in a dSLR bag.  Right now Amazon is selling the body for almost half the price I paid for my original Rebel and it is an good bargain. Many will be tempted to buy the newer T4i model which now is about the same price. The t4i may have some newer features and better video performance so it may be a very difficult decision for some to choose which way to go.  If you are a beginner looking at this camera for your first purchase of a dSLR may not a good choice.  I would stick with an entry level Canon or Nikon dSLR camera because it will take just as good images and be much easier to learn the basics. I think you can learn faster with a more simplified interface and lighter camera. If you find you really love photography it will be much easier the second time around to choose a more competent camera which will have more features and will probably cost less to buy in the future.The Canon 60d matched with a nice lens is possible to get superior images of macro objects very low light scenes with image quality not possible with the smaller sensor cameras.  However I must admit now I will not take this camera on a trip because of total weight with lenses and body.  This is always a personal decision everyone has to make when packing for a trip. I find a super zoom (bridge camera) like the Canon SX50 or the Panasonic FZ200 and subcompacts such as Canon S95 or S110 are easier to take anywhere and allow more candid photos.Things I like about the Canon 60D which are not available with the entry level Ti series.1. Extra info LCD display on top which gives extra helpful info but not easy to see in dark settingit has weak light which helps a little2. Great button placement and many individual controls for ISO Drive exposure etc3. Better and brighter viewfinder with pentaprism.4. Wireless flash control  more flash options5. Q menu allow quick change of functions... T4i has this with touch screen6. Longer battery life. Can take a huge number of images 500 plus before needing to recharge battery7. Many more custom settings allowed. They can easily be reset8. Electronic level helps keep horizon level helpful especially when on tripod.9. Many extra features and options in the menu system.10. Better grip camera is larger and easier to handle especially with a larger lens.11.  Better build quality than entry level or ti series.12.  Some weather sealing but not pro level. More robust than ti series but less than pro models which have magnesium frames. This doesn't have it.13.  Very fast focusing and display14.  Many more options than available to entry level models.Things not so great. I am struggling to find complaints so here are a few weak arguments.1.  60D has not been updated for almost 2 years. a new model will be out soon.2.  Camera is larger and heavier than ti series.3.  The LCD display is difficult to view in some lighting situations could be larger4.  No touch screen gps or other newer features found on newer cameras which might be on upgraded model at a higher price.Canon wisely steered this model to the Amateur who wants a little more Camera but does not need a professional model with Magnesium frame and fully weatherproofed with a giant sensor extra processors and a camera that can be used and abused. The 60D uses a poly-carbonate frame like the other rebels. It's strong enough and tough enough for 97% of us taking pictures. It probably has enough to satisfy anyone maybe even the pros who may chose to buy it as a second or third body.If you are trying to decide whether to buy this camera over the T4i the T4i has the edge because it has been upgraded to have many newer capabilities beyond the Canon 60D. The advanced amateur semipro and pro would probably be better off with the 60D primarily because of better ergonomics build quality weather sealing better viewfinder and more customization. The novice photographer to advanced photographer might be better of with the T41 with its many great new features. Both take great images with  a good lens (glass).What lenses to buy?The kit lens is OK starter lens and has the advantage of cost and lightness. Choosing a good lens is probably the most difficult decision in photography. The kit lenses offered by Canon for their cameras are a good start. Buying the Canon F1.8 is a no brainer because it's the best buy in lenses today.This review is about the Canon 60D but I mentioned the T4i which I also bought. You may wonder which I like better. I haven't decided yet because they are both great cameras and you can't go wrong with either. I hope this review has helped in your decision making.,0
DSLR Cameras,B0040JHVCC,Canon EOS 60D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       great all-around camera  September 22  2012By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I ordered the Canon 60D from Celltime (through amazon) as a factory refurbished unit.  I prefer to buy refurbished when possible.  I like that the product has been completely tested rather than hoping that it came off the assembly line in perfect condition.  It arrived as described and works flawlessly.  I had no trouble at all with the purchase and the delivery was on schedule.  I did a lot of research prior to my purchase as I wanted a full-frame dslr.  Since photography is a part time job for me I wanted a good quality camera that wouldn't break the bank.  Unfortunately a 5D MkII was just out of my budget and a 5D Classic is a still a great camera but is getting long in the tooth and has known mirror issues.  Coupled with the fact that I would have to replace all my lenses I decided to stay with a crop body.  For the type of shooting I do I saw no real benefit to going with the 7D.  I don't need the extra fps and the ""build quality"" argument a joke in my opinion.  When I think about all the ""plastic"" power tools that I own it really becomes clear.I have been using the 60D for a while now and am pleased with it's operation.  I was upgrading from a 1000D (Rebel XS)and find the auto-focus to be considerably better and the low-light performance to be very good too.  I really like the auto ISO with limit function.  I also like the 1/3 stop ISO intervals. The rotating LCD is nice but I rarely use it. I would not pick this camera just for that feature.  I always shoot raw so the scene modes and other fluff are unimportant to me.  The size and button layout work well for me.  I use back-button focus and had to spend a bit of time retraining my thumb to account for the extra buttons the 60D has that the XS didn't.For me it is all about function.  This camera does what I need and does it quite well.  It has a ton of stuff that I don't need but that is easy enough to work around.  I find the IQ to be very good especially coupled with my Sigma 17-50 f2.8.  A fantastic combo. Bottom line: a great camera at a good price.",0

It had been many years since I had a really nice camera - actually my last one was a film camera. I was looking for a solid and somewhat budget-friendly DSLR that would handle photos and video. Heard so many good things about this I took a chance and must say it has really paid off. It's really a fairly easy camera to learn. If you're a total photog novice it might take some playing with but there are tons of YouTube and other videos out there that help. Not too heavy. Comes with a great lens. Feels good and works great.What I like:PriceEasy of use.Easy to learnLots of extrasVideo quality is excellent.Feels goodRecommend!,0

Hopefully this will help someone who is undecided between the Canon T3i and the 60D.  I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago.  I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture iso and shutter speed.  Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots.  When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days but was sorely disappointed.  To make changes with the T3i you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display.  With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu.  The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings.  Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i:  Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings also shorter battery life,0

December 19  2014By ChrisDub,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Best camera I've owned! I have a D7 as well and I like this EOS 60D better. I bought it used and it's still held up 3.5 years later! Many many hours of video footage and thousands of pictures have been shot with this and I imagine many more in future. Don't spend 2 - 5 thousand on newer models... this is awesome! ...remember though you have to get the right lens. The lens that this comes with is standard - basic.. nothing special but even that lens has produced great photos for me and video. Oh btw I'm a professional photographer - I know what I'm talking about. ( here's a quick update: it's been about 6.5 years and the camera is still treating me very well. I had it professionally cleaned last week and it's functioning like new),0

What I like most is the articulating LCD screen which I use frequently when shooting in Live View mode. When shooting a fast prime lens wide open the depth of field is tight and focus is critical - I use the LCD in Live View zoom in on the target make a final focusing adjustment and the result is perfect every time.The Canon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens is my everyday lens on this camera and although I like the range from 18 to 200mm it's a pretty slow piece of glass. Two things help compensate: 1) The lens' image stabilization and 2) The camera's high ISO & long exposure noise reduction technology.Dislikes? The only one is a delay in writing data to the memory card when shooting RAW + large JPG mode with noise reduction turned on. It essentially doubles the image write time regardless of the speed of your card. So a 10-second fireworks shot will take 20 seconds to be captured & written to media.I'd buy the body all over again but I'd save for faster glass.,0

I have added a 50 mm prime lens a 17 -55 zoom for using indoors like museums and i just added a vivitar 500 mm f 6.3 mirror lens so i am pretty set now for a while.I do not shot movies much but the few that i have are very clear.

December 18  2016By Manhattan Dweller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Very nice.  The kit lens is as good as a kit lens gets. Got the Canon pancake 22mm 2F STM fixed lens and results are much better than the kit zoom lens.  The combination with the 22mm fixed lens is a very small pacakge with very fast and accurate AF and fair bokeh (see the attached picture.)  This is my go to lens for now.  Just got the Sigma Art 18mm-35mm 1.8F lens with 9 blade aperture and much improved bokeh and will try it out.  Be aware that 3rd party EOS M adapters have circular instead of oval opening found on Canon adapters.  So you will get a light haze when used on an APS-C sensor if you do not use a hood with 3rd party adapters...  Google it and you will see what I mean...For the size I really like this camera.  I wish there is micro AF adjustment but frankly I would not know where Canon can put it as it is already so compact.,1

The camera feels great in my hands and I'm really enjoying having a touch screen for the first time on a camera. The build quality of the camera is fine and the back screen and viewfinder are super sharp and bright.The kit lens seems fine but I need to really do more testing. It's very small but feels good in the hand and fits the body nicely. I picked up the Fotodiox Pro Lens Adapter with Auto-Exposure/Auto-Focus & Auto-Aperture (EF to EOSm - Auto) so I will be using this with some L glass. (Had a weird experience with that adapter. At first it would not autofocus. After a minute it kicked in I'm not sure if this delay is normal or not. If this continues I might need to return it for the more expensive Canon Version - Canon EOS M Mount Adapter )Since it showed up after dark I've only done a few test shots. Did a few with available light and was amazed at how good the image stabilization worked at super slow shutter speeds. Decided to see how the menus worked with 600EX-RT Speedlite controlled by the ST-E3-RT. Menus where just like what I have on my 5D MIII only of course with the touch screen.Very happy but honestly I haven't done very much with the camera yet. As I use and test it I'll update this review.,1

On first impression the camera performs well. I like the snappy auto focus this camera has but do find the shortcoming of it when zoomed to the larger focal lengths like 100 to 150mm. The auto focus seems to hunt a lot at those ranges especially in low light. Image quality is nice. Wouldn't recommend cropping the images because I notice some digital noise when zoomed in. I don't know if that is the camera or user error for being a beginner as well. WiFi capability is soooo useful and works great with the app. Size is small but nice for travel. EVF is great with little to no lag at all. The only disappointing this is that Canon doesn't have fast lenses for this M mount. My next purchase will be the adaptor and a fast EF lens. Overall good camera,0

DSLR Cameras,B01LXTX4HC,Canon EOS M5 Mirrorless Camera Kit…,        8 of 10 people found the following review helpful       An EVF camera I can live with for a few years without much compromise!  January 10  2017By Anant Dabholkar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have a lot of DSLR Gear mostly Canon with a lot of lenses. I had two issues with these one they were getting too heavy to haul around all day and 2 setting the focus point even with the toggles wasn't quick enough at times.This camera solves both those issues for me. Whether you use the Electronic Viewfinder (which is very good but I still prefer the optical ones in the DSLR's) or the back screen focus quick and very accurate on the MF. The Dual Pixel technology that Canon has is really a game changer. All lenses focus accurately where you want them to which is I think is critical (and difficult to nail quickly) as the exposure is a lot easier to handle using the P-A-S-M modes in creating a keeper.You can move the focus point in two ways:1. If looking thru the eye-finder by moving your thumb across the back screen and then pressing the shutter.2. Like a phone camera using the back-screen alone where you can touch the screen (and have it optionally click the shutter also)  which I find very convenient for snapshots.Its features and sensor are mostly based on the Canon 80D DSLR that was praised for its much improved dynamic range and customizability. The Auto ISO and AF parameter customising is a little less than the 80D but is livable and could be incorporated in a later firmware upgrade though unlikely based on Canon's past history of firmware upgrades.I noticed that the EF-M lenses especially the 22mm 28mm macro and 11-22 zoom are really good in all respects and the other zooms 15-45 18-150 (both kit zooms) and the 55-200 are also pretty sharp and contrasty. The combination of size weight 24MP and these lenses with dual pixel focus is unbeatable today.Being able to use all your other EF and EF-S lenses with a canon branded adapter without losing any functionality picture quality focusing speed is just icing on the cake.Would I replace a DSLR (especially with long lens) with this combo NO. Its not an action camera per se (ergonomically) but does quite well for casual action.Would I use this for movies  (I don't shoot/need 4K video) with all the features of silent focus in-lens stabilization combined with in-camera digital stabilization): YESI could stuff the camera kit zoom low light 22mm f/2.0 (35 mm Full Frame equivalent) prime the 11-22 wide angle zoom and 55-200 telephoto zoom with spare batteries polarizers etc and be ready for any airline based vacation with about 1/3rd the weight of my DSLR equivalent being able to cover 18 mm ultrawide to 320 mm telephoto full frame equivalent coverage.I wouldn't be giving up much with the quality of pictures although I would take the DSLR's if I were driving my car.This camera fills a unique niche (more so as a system) than other competitors camera systems. The EF-M lenses cost less than $500 for the most expensive 18-150 zoom and others are $250 to 400 currently. The competitions lenses are more expensive when you match picture quality. The latest Digic 7 processor in this camera improves speed and in-camera processing significantly over its predecessors such as the M3 and it beats using a phone for taking pictures hands down.And then there is Canons reliability and service which are second to none.,0

Shepard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"NIKON D7200 REVIEWI have always appreciated it when others especially early adopters/buyers take the time to write a thoughtful review of their own experiences with cameras and other equipment that I am interested in here on Amazon.Thus my motivation for this review is to- pay it back.My photo interests are photographing wildlife birds (especially hummingbirds) people & groups- pretty general stuff. While I do not make my living at photography I have been studying and working at improving my photography for many years.Presently I have and use the Nikon D300 & D600. Generally I keep a long lens on the D300 (a DX-crop-sensor body) for immediate use if/when wildlife wanders by as we live in a rural setting. The D600 (a FX or full-frame body) is my workhorse camera that I carry with me just about all the time.  I had a D7000 (DX body) but gave it as a gift to my wife when upgrading to the D600. I really enjoyed using the D7000 but  no getting a gift back once given!(If interested you can view examples of my photography at:  www dot flickr dot com/photos/pms_swim/  --  You will need to replace dot with a period (.)  Amazon still strips out web addresses in reviews I think). Anyway I decided to get a newer DX body as I have been using the D600 (FX) exclusively & would like to experience just a tad more reach a DX body provides with birds in flight with the lenses I use.Initially I purchased a refurbished D7100 (DX) -it seems like a nice camera but the copy I got had a very dirty sensor & I returned it. Thus I decided to buy a new body but could not find a great deal to warrant the expenditure at that point. This was before I heard about the D7200.Sothat is  how I came to pre-order a D7200 after reading about features and so forth. I was attracted to the fast shutter speeds up to 1/8000 sec (my D600 only goes to 1/4000 sec) the faster frame rate & relatively larger buffer the upgrade with auto-focus (AF). I am not into video yet but note that the D7200 seems capable.Likewise I am not sure I will use the wireless feature but hope to explore it soon.One obstacle I had to accept when ordering the D7200 is the lack of software support.In preparation for arrival of new camera I updated my Nikon software on one computer:switching from View NX to the just released  View NX-I and from Capture NX2 to the new Capture NX-Dso I would have software on hand to read the D7200  NEF (RAW) photo files.You probably have noticed that there always seems to be lag time in getting upgrades to photo software (e.g. Adobe) that accommodates the photo files produced by new cameras. I also purchased an inexpensive OP/TECH USA SUPER CLASSIC uni-loop camera strap  (here on Amazon) to replace the gaudy  NIKON camera straps. In addition to appearing more low-key when out & about with the camera it allows for easy switching to / from a wrist strap and for the temporary removal of the neck strap when placing camera on a tripod if desired.Another plus/factor in buying this camera is that it uses the same Nikon battery as the D600 so I have spares already on hand.Likewise the SD/SDHC memory card slot(s) use the same memory cards I have a supply of.AND THE CAMERA ARRIVED TODAY! I was a tad concerned to see that Amazon only packed the camera box inside another box without any additional packaging (air space) materials otherwise the out of the box experience was pretty great.  I slipped a charged battery in place & 2 SDHC cards & formatted them placed the 24-120mm F/4 Nikon AF-S lens on.Then I walked around the pond on a rare (of late) sunny day here in southwest Arkansas. (see photos). I was adjusting menus as I went. The AUTO  setting produced nice photos in the shade but was trying to POP UP  the flash with bright backgrounds so I switched to aperture priority & set the ISO about 500.Also I am used to setting the AE-L/AF-L button on back as my AF on button and use the shutter only for metering & shutter release. I had some initial confusion in doing this as the AUTOFOCUS menu scrolls up into MOVIE settings & I kept missing that detail. I eventually remembered how to set the AE-L/AF-L button & shutter release button correctly. Fortunately one of the cats accompanied me on the stroll around the pond & proved to be a great model for trying AF with & without 3d tracking AF on. Using 3d tracking AF II was able to fire away & capture most of the shots in sharp focus as the cat rushed toward me. Without 3d tracing AF II would only get the initial photo in focus. The autofocus is very quick. I also took photos of bees in front of their hive birds in flight  fish on the surface of the pond and several flowers. The exposure and colors on the back of the camera (saving both NEF to card 1 JPG to card 2) look great. Now over exposed  several photos on this very bright day but that was more camera operator error.  I will want to try the AF later near dusk to see how camera operates in lowlight.I will try to post these examples (cat fish on pond daffodils birds in flight  honey bees peach blossoms) for your viewing. NoteI still need to open & review the camera manual.  Nor have I loaded the photos into the computer to see what ViewNX-I or Capture NX-D do with the NEF (RAW) files.I will try to update if there is any interest. I will also try to answer any questions.UPDATE: for past couple of days  I have tried to strip the non-characters"" from this review but they keep showing back up so i nuked review & tried to redo. We will see. sorry. best intentions gone astray.Using the 300mm f/4 AF-S Nikor prime lens gives me hope that the autofocus will perform admirably. I took some photos of birds about bird feeder & will try to post them here also. (NOTE: photos that I am attaching are from NEF files converted via VIEW NX-I at about 60% balance quality/compression to jpgs. trade off size of file vs. helping you view details. I will also post to my FLICKR site at 100% (see address above in review). Also I am having to learn how to use new Nikon Capture NX-D & View NX-I.",1
DSLR Cameras,B01DKY3F4U,Nikon D7200 24.2 MP DX-format Digital…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       I LOVE this camera!  June 5  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After a lot of research I decided to buy this camera and I couldn't be happier with my purchase - I love it! Previously I was using the Nikon D5300 a fantastic camera in its own right. When it became damaged I had to decide whether to replace the same model or upgrade to a new camera. Other reviewers have given great reviews on the technical aspects already but since some of you may be wondering whether to jump from the 5000 series to the 7000 series like I did I thought I'd offer my humble comparison.The two camera models are similar but different enough that it will take some time to get used to the change. I am still trying to learn the ins and outs of the D7200 because it offers so many more options; if you want bells and whistles the D7200 has them: an in-camera level more buttons to make quick changes or assign them to new uses and quicker access to settings are a few that come to mind. Back button focus (if you use it as I do) takes a few extra steps to set up than I remember it on the D5300 but this camera offers it and it works perfectly. Performance-wise it is not so very different from the D5300 but the D7200 seems to lock focus just a tiny bit faster and more accurately especially in low light and I'm able to bump my ISO a bit higher without as much noise as before. One other reason I chose this camera is that it has the auto fine-tuning feature which allows you to fine tune your lenses to the camera which the D5300 did not have. I have had lens focus issues in the past and this camera has helped me to make sure my lenses are ready to go.As to the camera body it is water resistant and pretty rugged which gives me greater peace of mind when I'm out shooting in a light sprinkling of rain or at the beach. I haven't done any accidental drop tests yet (knock on wood) but it certainly feels heavy and sturdy. One thing the D7200 does not have which I had on the D5300 and do miss having is an adjustable angle viewing screen on the back. On the D7200 it is attached to the back of the camera which helps with the weatherproofing aspect but makes it difficult for me to see the screen when I'm lying on the ground shooting and impossible while taking a self-portrait. The top-mounted LCD is fantastic for quickly changing my settings. I also love that it has a light I can turn on and off when needed. The weight difference between the D5300 and the D7200 is noticeable (the D7200 is heavier) but it's not uncomfortable to hold. The battery life is also noticeably longer on the D7200 (previously I kept three batteries in my camera bag; now I carry just two).In all I have been so happy with the performance I have gotten out of this camera. I doubt I will be upgrading anytime in the next decade because it does such an amazing job for me that I have no need of anything else.,0

Low light and high ISO settings performance are much better and the focusing system is extremely good (more accurate focusing over the D7100). I take this camera everywhere I go and just love the photos coming out of this camera. This camera has the performance of Nikon's full frame cameras but at the price of a cropped sensor camera. All the controls and dials are very well thought out and it won't be a stranger if you're used to Nikon D610 and D750. Unless you need the ultimate low light performance of a full frame camera (which is marginally better than this camera) then the D7200 is the right camera for a semi-pro shooter. I ended up leaving my Nikon D810 at home most of the time and this little guy gets to travel with me 90% of the time. Just get some good lenses for it and you will be amazed by the quality of this camera.,1

July 15  2015By Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,We bought this camera primarily for my wife and our photography business. We have both been using the Nikon D7000 but didn't upgrade when the D7100 came out because it seemed to be an incremental upgrade and not worth the cost at least at that time. The D7200 on the other hand was quite a jump from our D7000 and we decided to pull the trigger and get one after hearing of the product release.The D7200 has performed perfectly and the jump in low light capabilities helps tremendously. We may not upgrade our second D7000 this year but will definitely be getting another D7200 when we do.,0

Lavaroni,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It had been a long time since I had time for photography and I was not sure I really needed a DSLR when there are so many decent point and shoot systems out there.  But I am really glad I took the chance on this camera.  I had forgotten how much I loved photography and how good I actually was.  This camera challenges me to make critical decisions about my photography and gives me the tools to execute on the decisions I make.  I jumped right back in and am shooting almost entirely on manual mode and the quality of my shots is outstanding (most of the time ;-).  I am trying to give the Program modes a shot at making some of the decisions for me - especially when I am not in a thinking mood and just want to shoot like a P&S and they do a great job. I'll never make money off my photography but I have quickly become the defacto photographer for every family event and it is always with me on my hikes and travels and has all the settings I need to switch from street to landscape to portraiture depending on where I am at any given moment.  I have a long way to go before I master all the intricacies but this system has reawakened a passion in me and makes me feel like a kid again exploring a talent that I had let go completely dormant.  If you can commit some time to practice and want the flexibility and power that a DSLR can give you the D7200 is a great camera for prosumers and has a decent selection of DX lenses.  It would be nice if Nikon would invest in super wide DX lenses the way they do for FX but off brand manufacturers are filling the space nicely.  Unless you need massive enlargements I doubt you will ever miss the full format system.,1

There was nothing wrong with my old camera but I wanted to upgrade anyway.  The kit lens does a great job of being a nice walk around lens.  I don't find myself swapping lenses nearly as much.  I also really like the built in wifi feature.  I took some photos at a nephews graduation and afterwards I was able to drop them into the family's phones so they could do the usual uploads to social media and email them to other family.  Have 2 SD slots is a nice touch as you can set one to store images in JPEG and the other in RAW.  While I did like the flip out screen on my D5100 I didn't use it all that often so I don't think I will miss it much.  I think this camera is a great stepping stone before going to full frame.,0

October 23  2016By Tony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,WowBought this camera as a replacement for a D90 mainly for astrophotography work.No low pass filter allows the sensor to gather more of the spectrum. The ring nebula showed it's multi-colored hues in a 30 second exposure on the D90 it was monochromatic. Still has good electronics to allow use in the brightest of conditions.The image detail is fantastic. The only problem is going to be storage space as the files are double the size of the D90.Controls are familiar to anyone using a Nikon built in the last couple of decades being pretty much the same except for the Selection Dials (PSAM) on the left there are two of them and they are stacked both requiring a release to be actuated before thaey can be turned. A little tricky for arthritic fingers.Able to use all my D90 lenses so I didn't have to reinvest in another infrastructure to remain flexible in my shooting choices.The retailer was fantastic as always don't get caught up in the super discount .sites that are trying to sell Grey Market as American Market (Warrantable) cameras.,0
DSLR Cameras,B007FGZ1V0,Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame…,        20 of 20 people found the following review helpful       I had been shooting with the Canon 7D which is a great camera. I will still shoot with the 7D ...  January 20  2016By L Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this camera 5 months ago to use in my Fashion business and also for my Photography business. I had been shooting with the Canon 7D which is a great camera. I will still shoot with the 7D for my Photography business but for my Fashion business this camera has resolved all of the lighting problems we had with interior shooting.  I needed the speed of the AF and all those cross type AF points and the high fps for action shots occasionally and couldn't find anything that came close to the 7D in terms of performance before now.The Body is well built and handles well in every situation I have used this in.The Low Light capability is over the top.  I have not noticed the weight at all on this camera being a problem even with longer heavier lenses it handles well. 61-POINT AUTO FOCUS:The AF system here is identical to that in the 1Dx and is THE most sophisticated AF system EVER put in any Canon body. It is superior to that in the 1DV and all bodies before it.While most of us wanted only a 7D equivalent AF system Canon delivered the flagship system found in the 1Dx. The AF has not missed focus for me yet.The AF accuracy metering and noise is over the top in comparison to other cameras I have shot with and handled over the years. This camera is super fast and super sharp.I have tested the AF point in servo and one shot mode with my fastest lenses. Speed accuracy and consistency have been exceptional and better than anything I have used before. AF gets the job done. enter AF point and all peripheral AF points are all usable with fast primes.I am amazed with the results at 1600 after minor RAW adjustments to the noise there is virtually no grain and the image is perfectly useable. I did test the 25600 and while I would never use this ISO in a shoot situation I was impressed with the quality. Yes there was noise but you're at an ISO of 25600ISO Range. This is one of the main reasons why I bought this camera. Whereas the the 5D3 is usable up to ISO 12800. (In comparison the 7D is usable up to ISO 1600Every feature on  5D3 is an upgrade over the 5D2.BUILD QUALITY:It's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed but the 5DIII just feels more substantial. It feels like a chopped down 1-series instead of a buffed up 10 series. The contour of the body has changed to fit your hand better. The rubber is also a new compound which is much grippier than before. The 5DIII feels much better to hold and use than the previous 5D bodies.JPEG:Out of the camera the Canon JPEGs are phenomenal. With processing if needed they are quite remarkable.Exposure Bracketing / HDR / Stacking*  The Mark III now supports 7 exposures -- A huge improvement in the software for anyone doing HDR.* The Mark III has in-camera HDR processing which is nice (perhaps to get an idea how something looks on the spot)* The Mark III supports in-camera image stacking which can be used for a variety of creative and scientific effectsSD Card* Having a second slot with the second one being SD is a very nice addition however slows down your shooting tremendously and this is a feature I will not be using.Silent mode* It is perhaps quiet enough for you to even take a few shots in places where photography is generally frowned upon.Burst mode* 6FPS is a major improvement over the previous version. ISO:The high ISO performance of this camera is simply incredible. With the 7D I tried to limit my high ISO shooting to about 6400...  I am extremely comfortable shooing up to ISO 25600 with the 5D3. Images are still very detailed with very nice looking fine grain. Images don't become flat looking and still have a really nice look to them. I will even shoot 51200 without a problem although there is a big increase of noise beyond the native ISO values.  It really is impressive.he JPEG engine in this camera is staggeringly good and a solid 2 stops better at controlling noise at high ISO than the previous version.METERING: I find myself correcting with exposure compensation MUCH less now  Shooting with the two side the newfound metering accuracy of the mark III is very obvious.The new 5DIII is much improved here.WHITE BALANCE:I've noticed that while post processing I'm having to correct color less with the 5DIII files. This is very exciting as it will save me a fair amount of time in post processing. Per usual all of the cameras struggle under tungsten lighting. However AWB is able to get color surprisingly close with anything that contains natural lighting.MENUS:I would strongly advise reading the manual because there are a lot of new settings and options which won't be familar to 5DII users. There are also a LOT of different ways to set up your AF system so a little experimentation is needed. In general the menu system is more complicated that before but this also allows a much greater degree of customization of the camera. In that regard the 5DIII is much closer to a 1-series than before. Take the time to learn it and set it up correctly.My next camera will definitely be the Canon EOS-1D X but for now this camera meets all of my needs and then some for my Fashion Business and my Photography business.LENS: EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USMI purchased the  Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame CMOS with the included EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM. I was familiar with this lens already having purchased two of them prior for two family members and using it for from time to time.  I had wanted a walk around lens with IS so getting this included lens was going to be my answer for that.So far as an owner of this lens I really do not like it on my 5D camera. (personal choice)  I will use it more on my 7D camera in my photography business.I am used to shooting with the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM and this will be my lens that I will use the most on this camera body.,1

March 19  2016By MrFixIt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I was waiting for the 5d mark III successor to come out but so far nothing but rumors of what it will be and when it will come out so I took the plunge and bought this.  This is an upgrade from a canon 70D that I used for shooting indoor high school fast action sports.  Stepping up to this full frame made a huge difference in photo quality.  I was expecting ""much better""  and found what I got was beyond that and my expectations.  I usually used fixed 2.8 (70-200) lenses and shoot wide open aperatures.  Everything about this is better than the 70D except I saccrificed 1 FPS in burst mode.  I am just an amateur with barely 2 years experience but find my photos now easily rival those taken by and sold at the venues by the pros.  My local newspapers are giving me media credentials to go and shoot for them as I gain experience.  Bottom line this camera does not disappoint in meeting my goal of shooting great action photos in poorly lit venues.  I am shooting in manual with 1/500 shutter speeds f/2.8 and my iso (camera set to auto iso) is rarely above 3000 in worst cases and usually 1500 or less.  Beads of sweat on athletes faces clearly visible (70-200 lens zoomed in) on subjects 40+ feet away.  I do realize Nikon has more cameras that outperform this is ISO tests/ratings and for somewhat less money but after buying the 70D first I committed a lot of money to good canon lenses and just didn't want to sell everything canon I have and start over with Nikon.",0

May 29  2015By Stuart H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,IT IS BRILLIANT!  After three years with a 5D Mark II I finally see the light!  The auto focus in the 5D Mark III is spot-on first time every time.  I have been living with Canon L-Series lenses and what I thought was state of the art body in the Mark II.  NOW . . . I see that the Mark III is a totally different camera with a tack-sharp auto focus.  I didn't realize that the Mark II could be better until I got the Mark III.  But let me put my money where my mouth is . . . the Magnolia below was photographed with a 100-400mm lens from about 30 feet away.  I thought it was a throw away shot when I took it and when I got it home I was amazed.  In fact they got the auto focus from the 1 series cameras and it really shows.  Again the Mark III is WORTH the money and is what a high-end camera should do.,1

Even though it is expensive - since I don't make any money from this hobby - it is the best investment I made!Things I liked in this camera compared to my T2i -  picture quality shutter sound double card slots with simultaneous raw and jpg capture advanced view finder in-camera hdr micro focus adjustment for lenses etc. There are many reviews on internet for other technical details and features.I found the AF system of this camera takes some time to master and it got many more options and features to learn for a T2i user.Now if you are a user like me don't hesitate to buy this camera as you will like the features and image quality.I am still learning to use this camera and think it will keep me entertained for a while :-)Please note that this camera is heavier and little bigger than Rebel models.I used this camera with my Canon 24-70 2.8 L lens and it can get heavy after 4-5 hours of use :-)Please check and rate my images and reviews.Thanks,1

November 24  2014By Steve B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Ok...so I'm totally THAT dad.  First I opted for the Canon 60D...and although it was good...I felt it wasn't the best.  I also didn't care for the whole crop sensor issue as I felt that I had to leave the room just to take a picture of a group of people!  I was shooting with a 50 mm f/1.4 lens at the time.  Forget about taking pictures if there was any sort of space constraint.  So after a couple of months playing around with the 60D I upgraded to the 5D Mark III.All I can say is AWESOME!The quality of images shot through the roof.  I have several lenses that I use but the 50mm 1.4 and a 40 mm 2.8 are my favorites.  It's like the camera can take just the right picture in any sort of light!  Also added in the Speedline 430EX flash and now everything looks even better.If you can afford the higher priced Mark III and a decent lens...go for it.  It's worth it.  The other cameras are good too...but you may beg tired of the crop sensor issue.  I've uploaded some of my pictures if you are curious.  And like I said...yes I'm totally 'that dad.'OK...I lied.  I can't figure out how to add images.  It isn't exactly clear here on Amazon.  Perhaps I can write a review on that?  If there is a kind amazon helper that can assist me with this I'd really like to add some images. :),0
DSLR Cameras,B007FGZ1V0,Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame…,        28 of 30 people found the following review helpful       Absolutely great  January 14  2014By MT1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The switch from Nikon:After being with nikon for 16+ years I recently threw in the towel. As a wedding shooter I count on my equipment and need things to work correctly.I had purchased two nikon d600's 1 year apart and both had the horrible dust/debris issue. After repeat cleanings and 20000+ shots both cameras still had the issue. I got tired of wet cleaning the sensors and got tired of nikons poor customer service. Nikon decided that the D600 owners just had to either deal with repeat sensor cleanings or send in the camera to ""possibly"" have the issue resolved. Nikon had no proven fix besides switching out the shutter and praying that the issue went away. Nikon released the d610 and left the rest of the people hanging.Leaving nikon was extremely difficult for me because I had a big investment in the bodies accessories and glass. I made the move at a huge loss but am extremely happy that I did.The differences:I purchased both a 6D and the 5D mark III from amazon. The immediate thing that I have noticed is that all my canon glass has been good with focus right out of the box. With almost every nikon lens/camera combo I had to pull out a focus chart and focus tune software and apply fine tuning. I also noticed that the focus system on my canons do not have the tendency to act up under tungsten lighting like my nikons did. My d600's and d7000 had a tendency to back-focus under heavy tungsten lighting.The canon DPP software is a pleasure to use. I hated Nikon capture NX2. It was slow and the user interface was horrible. Canon DPP loads quickly and applying batch changes is amazing. I do miss the Nik software selection point feature of CNX2.The one thing I don't like is the fact that canon makes you purchase your lens hoods separately and at a premium.I do like the fact that the canon equipment is made in japan and has a quality feel to it compared to cameras like the d600 that are made in Thailand.The 5D mark iii vs D800:Prior to leaving nikon I also spent a week with the nikon D800. I found that the d800 produced a lot of noise in the raw files when pushed to higher iso's. This alone was enough to turn me off. I did test my sample of the d800 for left focus issues. I did not have the left AF issue of older d800's but the camera I got had some focus issues that required fine tuning all my glass to the body. In some cases the fine tune was at +20.The D800 files did have a lot of detail and dynamic range but the file size was huge. If you shoot a lot of landscape and want lots of dynamic range the d800 is a good option. But the dynamic range comes at the cost of nikons lack of quality control.If dynamic range is not your main goal but want a great reliable camera with a killer AF system (better in my testing) and smaller files the canon 5D mark III is amazing. I suggest not to get caught up in the megapixel game unless you do some very heavy cropping like birds in flight for which the d800 may be a better choice. The 5D mark III files are great and have plenty of latitude for most users.5D mark III:Focus:Focus Focus Focus. The 5D mark III has a killer focus system. The best that I have used. The focus system is lighting fast accurate and very very customizable. It is a pleasure to be able to customize my focus system like this. I recently shot an event and out of 700+ images I scrapped maybe 10 shots because of focus. The ones I did delete because of focus was do to me not placing the focus point on the right area of the image. No back/front focus like my nikons had. No focus shift under tungsten lighting like some nikons.The hit rate on focus is amazing. You want to know why canon can charge a premium for this camera? Because of its pure amazing focus system! If you absolutely need the best focus system on any camera this is it.Customization:You can assign buttons to do certain functions and to your own shooting style. This is a god send compared to nikons lack of customization.Body:The camera is solid with a good feel in the hand. The buttons are easy to operate and cleverly located. Coming from nikon is an adjustment because the camera buttons are in a different layout. It will become easy to use after some time and practice.I did not like the fact that canon has no built in removable screen protector like the nikon. This is a minor gripe but one that I resolved by buying the vello stick on glass protectors. I know the nikon plastic screen protectors are not fancy but they did a good job of protecting the screen from bumps.Images:The 5D makr III images are fantastic. The auto white balance works much better compared to my nikons I had owned. The 5D mark III is not able to pull details from the shadows like the D800 or D600 so it is a sacrifice in dynamic range if that is the most important thing to you. Nikon still has canon beat in dynamic range.I will personally will take a in focus sharp good out of camera white balance and dust free image out of a canon any day vs a hit and miss focus and dusty d600 image with dynamic range. An out of focus image with dirt is useless to me.Conclusion:If you shoot anything that requires this focus system this reliability and this customization BUY THIS CAMERA. I found the 5d and 6d is a perfect combo. I use the 6D with the wifi feature when working in a studio paired to an ipad and use the 5D when shooting a wedding or anything that moves at a fast pace.The 5d mark III continues to sell even at the higher price because it is a proven camera and you cant go wrong with it. I love it and will update this review as I use it more. I am glad I left nikon and I hope they learn one day that customer loyalty is earned.",0

August 14  2014By HJM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera is amazing.The price is nuts but if you are looking at this camera then you already know what it's all about and are ready to shell out the big bucks.I jumped from my nearly decade-old 20D to this and obviously it's a whole new level.  If you have any investment at all in L series glass and/or fast primes you really need this camera body.  My photos were nice before but the full frame sensor working in concert with fast lenses (especially the fast primes) is simply awesome.The only and I mean the ONLY negative is lack of autofocus during movie recording.  Even that isn't all that bad if you prepare for it properly.I guess another negative is that this body is so amazing I want to spend even MORE money on glass.,0
DSLR Cameras,B007FGZ1V0,Canon EOS 5D Mark III 22.3 MP Full Frame…,        8 of 8 people found the following review helpful       5D3  worth it!!  January 3  2014By C. luong,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm a photo enthusiast not a pro. Like others have said this camera is truly the Jack of all Trades. It does everything well. This is the first time that I upgraded to Full Frame. Coming from the 7d I liked its performance and image quality at low ISO. But as the 7d gets above 3200 or 6400 I would have to do more post processing images were too grainy and lost a lot of details. In certain cases images were unusable. But with this 5D3 not afraid to use High ISO. I was at a wedding shot around 500 photos and they came out great. Some photos I didn't have too much post processing at all.1. Image Quality - excellent sharp more natural colors2. AutoFocus - lots of points fast Spot-On focus3. High ISO performance - excellent less noise I was able to use photos shot 6400 and above. Less post processing time4. Performance - 6 fps5. Brings out the best in my cheap lens!6. Dual Card slots7. Price - @$2700...Yes worth it!For those considering 5D3 or debating between 6d and 5D3 I would say get this camera. The 6d just doesn't have some of the important features that 5D3 have which could come in handy in the future and I think it's worth the extra $$. Hopes this helps out others who are deciding.,0

The Mark II had really served me well but I didn't have rain protection on one of my photo tours this year and during the week of intense rains here in Colorado the Mark II gave out after being in the rain for 2 days. I needed a camera right away while my Mark II went in for repairs.I decided to go with the Mark III since it used compact flash and also I wanted the upgraded 61-point focusing system and the faster frame rate.  Both the Mark III and the 6D have the new Digic 5+ processor which is amazing but the Mark III can shoot at a full 6fps allowing me to use the camera in more action related situations and so I didn't need to purchase a 2nd camera for the occasional sporting events I was shooting.On my last photo tour we did some astro photography just outside of Crested Butte Colorado on Ohio Pass and the result was some amazing images at ISO 5000 with little to no noise! I literally was able to use image right out of the camera with no post noise reduction.I also shoot portraits and occasionally I get requests to shoot the kids in action. I went to one of the high school football games to capture of few of my students in action on the football field and I was able to shoot at ISO 12800 so I could capture the players in action with a fast enough shutter speed. This in combination with 6fps gave me clean crisp images. Post noise reduction was minimal.  The 5D Mark II would never have been able to match this camera's performance.  Iso 6400 on the Mark II is loaded with noise so 12800.I am disappointed in the fact that the SD card slot is not UDMA-7 compatible and will only support write speeds of 133X.  If you want to shoot fast with no buffering then don't use the SD card slot.  Stick to the compact flash. When you pair this camera with the Lexar 1000X  or San Disk Extreme Pro CF cards it can shoot all day long at 6fps and you never notice any buffering.I love the new beefier body and grip.  It feels really good in the hands and ever better than the Mark II.  Though it is heavier I love the magnesium body. This camera is much more solid and tight sealing than my Mark II though during my trip to Telluride I made sure I had rain and snow protection for the camera.The price is high for this camera but I'm totally happy with my purchase. I'm glad I didn't settle for the 6D. The new 61-point focusing system and the 6fps frame rate made this the right purchase for me plus the fact that I could take advantage of my already huge investment in compact flash cards I already owned and didn't have to move to new SD cards.Love this investment in my business!  Totally worth it!,0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        68 of 69 people found the following review helpful       The 7D / 18-135 package is worth considering  August 21  2010By nate42nd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I thought I would write this so people can make up their minds about the lens choice. The 28-135 USM lens which comes with the other kit is probably a better lens BUT the EF-S 18-135 is more versatile. The 18-135 is WAY wider and just as long. The lens makes a little more noise and the manual focus ring does rotate while auto-focusing. That said the image quality is far better than I thought it would be. I wasn't planning to use the kit lens much. I have other lenses to use with my 7D I have found myself using the 18-135 more than I thought. The image quality is surprisingly great! The focusing ring rotating while auto-focusing has been a non-issue. It has not even been a concern. The 18-135 has better image quality than the 18-200. I think it's one of Canon's best all=around lenses now that I have used it for a few weeks. I am glad I chose this kit over the 28-135 because of the ability to go wide if you need it.Enough about the great lens. The 7D has been great! Read the reviews on DP Review or TheDigitalPicture for the specifics. I cannot say enough good about the 7D. I came from a T1i and there is NO COMPARISON between the Rebel series and the 7D. It's not even close. The T2i (at the time of this review) is a good alternative to the 7D if you don't have the extra $$ but the 7D is FAR better in so many ways. The feel in your hand the focusing system high speed continuous shooting the ability to customize the buttons on the body to do whatever you want the electronic level (use it all the time in VF AND LCD) all of the custom functions wireless flash control built in metering system transmissive LCD viewfinder that looks amazing!..you cannot really compare the 7D to anything except the 5D MkII. The 7D is a better camera than the 5D. The ONLY thing the 5D has is full-frame and I LIKE the crop factor of the 7D. All lenses get in closer and if you want a wider angle get a wide angle lens like the EF-S 10-22. The APS-C format is here to stay. I got the best EF-S lens (17-55 IS USM) and it's the best lens I can imagine. Canon is showing us the APS-C is going to be around for a long time.The owner's manual is great (like all Canon DSLRs) and the battery life has been spectacular! There is a built in gauge that tells you how many shots you have on the current battery and the quality of the battery. I got an Opteka battery as a spare for less than half the price of the Canon and it has worked fine and charges fine with the included charger.The built in wireless speedlite controller in the 7D is a big plus also. There is no need to get one accessory. It will control off camera flashes.The Canon 7D is a better camera than the T5i (Rebel series)or the 5D IMO. The price is reasonable for what you are getting....A camera you could keep for a long time.One thing to note: when you first get the camera...put the lens on and before you put a battery in....look through the viewfinder. You will be shocked it needs power from the battery to work. Without power the VF looks dark and cloudy. It has an LCD so you can overlay grid lines focusing aids and the electronic level inside. I didn't know this when I looked at the 7D at my local camera shop. I almost didn't buy one because I thought the VF was terrible. It turns out it's because there was no battery installed at the time!This ""review"" is not very well done and a little random but I really wanted to let everybody know that this kit with the 18-135 is nothing short of great! I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you are a pro this lens is not good enough for you but it's good enough for most and WELL worth having around even if you are a pro or aspiring pro. It's SO versatile. LOVE IT.The 7D is one of the best cameras in the world for any price at the time of this review. It's a little expensive for some but worth it. Get one and find out.Update: 11/17/10 - I ended up getting the EF-S 17-55 F/2.8 IS USM lens and it's the best thing since sliced bread. It stays on the 7D almost all the time. I also got an EF 24-104 F/4L and it's amazing. I sold the 18-135 that came with th e camera. I would have sold the 28-135 as well. I would still recommend the 18-135 that comes with this kit....but I would recommend MORE that you simply buy the body only and get a 17-55 F/2.8 IS USM with it. You might as well start off with the best lens ever made for this camera.The 7D: I cannot imagine a better camera for any price. It does everything SO well. landscapes kids pets sports action still life low light any thing you want to photograph the 7D will let you do WELL. The ISO range and performance has been more than satisfactory. The 7D has not disappointed in any way. It has exceeded my expectations. I am about to do another video on YT under the same user name. I have some videos up there already on the 7D. I will be doing a 90 day review on what I think of the camera. I would highly recommend it still.....even with the upcoming release of the 5DmkIII in a few months. Get a 7D and get this lens or the body and the 17-55 2.8 and you will be very happy.Update: 2/11/11 - I continue to use this 7D. I use the 24-105 F/4L 17-55 F/2.8 and 100mm macro mostly. The camera is good for any type of shooting. It has great image quality. I have now used it in snow storms rain wind dust etc. I have had no problems with it. I still plan to use this camera for quite some time. I see no reason to move to anything else. The 7D continues to be one of the best out there. The built in flash control has come in handy but I got a $40 Cactus trigger (no you cannot buy them here) They work great. I can use the 430EXii anywhere and off camera. The built in flash has limitations. It does not work outside sometimes if it's too bright or there is too much distance. As I said before buy body only and get a really good lens. This camera is equipped with a very nice sensor. You need a good lens to take advantage of the resolution. Get a good ""L"" lens or the 17-55 Canon F/2.8 IS. You will not be disappointed. I am curious to see what they do to replace this camera. It will be quite a day when they top the 7D.Update 4-17-11 - I am coming up on a year since I got this combo. Now since the terrible earthquake in Japan the prices are up. I have not seen any issues with the 7D yet. I am still impressed with it. I use it almost every day. I carry it with me in an ""Ape Case"" bag along with my 17-55 F/2.8 24-105 F/4L 50mm and 100mm lenses. I love this thing and would still recommend buying it. The replacement will not be out for over a year if even then. Get the 7D. It's still a good buy. The Nikon D7000 is a good alternative now however. Not as good as the 7D in my opinion but newer sensor tech. I would get the 7D body only and use the lenses you already have. If you are getting a 7D as your 1st DSLR it's too much camera for you. Learn on a T1i T2i T3i then move up in a few months if you are still learning. Get a 50mm if you don't have any lenses. If you have the money get a 17-55 24-70 or 24-105L lens. The lens this combo comes with does not match the 7D quality. It will do but the 7D deserves a better lens.Update 9-17-11  - For those of you still reading I am still using the 7D hard. It has about 15000-20000 clicks on the shutter. It still looks and feels new! Every time I use the 7D is like the first time. Nothing is loose broken or even worn. The 7D is the type of camera I wish would last the rest of my life. The number of options you have with this camera in the menus with it's dual processors speed ease of use etc...still make me happy. As you may know already I sold the kit lens (18-135) I use a 100mm 2.8 macro 50mm 1.8 17-55 24-105 mostly. I have others as well. The 7D is STILL one of the best cameras money can buy for stills AND video. I am very pleased with the image quality build quality look feel and ease of use. I expect to get 50000 to 100.000 shots with it. Maybe more. I will use the 7D until I can get better results with something else.Update 6-12-12  - I continue to use and enjoy the 7D. I have gone through many lenses. The 24-105 and 17-55 and 100mm macro are my favorites. For the first time since film cameras I don't even feel the need to upgrade. The 7D continues to do a great job with any situation. Portraits still life action sports family events anything I care to shoot.....the 7D does a great job. I have found that anything under 1600 ISO needs no noise reduction. 3200 and 6400 needs some NR. A new or used 7D would be a good choice. It's a very capable camera here in 2012. Just an update for those interested. I have had a great experience with the 7D.Update 4-15-13 - I am still using the 7D body and plan to keep using it for another year or two. I just can't find any other reason to upgrade. The overall image quality and my ability to capture shots with the 7D to be very good. There are many options in 2013. With the price of the 7D body down a bit.....I would still buy one today. I would get the body only then find a good lens to fit your style of photography. Pick up a 50mm F/1.8 or 1.4 with the body while deciding what lens (or lenses) you want. The 17-55 is great. The 24-105 is great also. If you want a cheaper option then you might consider the 18-135 with the body. I just wanted to do one last update with a camera now about 4 years old......it's still great. Most cameras would be obsolete now but the 7D is an exception. It was so good when it first came out.....it's still worth buying today. I am still loving it. The 7D has never let me down. Now with firmware version 2.0.3 it has even more features. Amazing camera. I am very happy.Update 8-19-13  - The 2.0.3 Firmware really improves the performance of this camera. You can re-size JPGs edit RAW images and convert to JPG in camera. Those are just some of the new features. The buffer now holds many more files both JPG and RAW while shooting at 8FPS. GPS capability has been added. The sensor has been surpassed by new cameras BUT the 7D still has excellent image quality for anything from action sports portraits macro. With this new update I feel like I got a new camera. If you have a 7D update it. If you are thinking of buying one.....it's still a great camera body. A bit over priced now.....but worth it. Canon might be able to do even more with firmware updates in the future with the 7Ds dual processors and excellent quality.Update 1-14-15  -  I still have and use the Canon 7D. Now that the newer 7D MKII is out it is hard to NOT upgrade however the original 7D is still worth owning and using. The newer sensor and focus on the 7D MKII is better. I have given this a lot of thought.....whether to upgrade or not. I have decided to stick with the original 7D for another year. Unless you make large prints you will never notice the difference between the two cameras. (or any other crop sensor camera) The original 7D is still a formidable camera. With the 2.0.3 (now 2.0.5) firmware update it is more than most amateurs need or will use. The 7Ds sensor and focus ability is VERY good still. The images are still worth printing and viewing on screen. Use the RAW mode and use software to enhance your images. Nobody will be able to tell the difference. I love the 7D and have no plans to go full frame yet. Next upgrade I will consider going full frame and get rid of my 17-55 and 55-250. EF-S lenses will not work with full frame bodies. If you are buying new right now.....I would go with the 7D MKII just because the price difference is not worth buying the original now. If you are looking at used cameras the original 7D is a steal at used prices. I would do that. I all come down to your price range as usual. 7D is still kicking and worth using even at weddings and other events. The RAW images processed are great. As I said in earlier posts I sold the 18-135 long ago and now use a 17-55 24-105 and 100mm Macro 50mm F1.8. I am very satisfied. Whoever gets my camera when I finally sell it will be getting a very good deal. It looks new to this day. Get a used 7D. If you can afford more get a new 7D MKII.",0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       APS-C Wonder Child  December 5  2013By P.K. Frary,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"UPS delivered a new 7D on October 8 2009 five weeks after I placed an Amazon pre-order. During the last 4.5 years I've gotten to know this groundbreaking DSLR well. With weather seals at the level of the legendary EOS 1N high performance appointments and contoured magnesium body shell the 7D is like a mini 1D. It's solid yet comfy in hand: deep finger grooves in the grip and thick textured rubber make for a secure handhold. The large thumb rest anchors the thumb and increases grip security.The shutter is softer than a 50D but louder than my 60D and 6D. If you're a SLR shooter you'll consider the 7D pianissimo. At 8FPS I call it fast. To maintain high FPS you need a good battery and the 7D is good for 1000 images per charge. Obviously video and live view reduce battery time. The LP-E3 batteries are dependable and have a useable life of about 3 years.CONTROL INTERFACE: Controls revolve around 3 wheels 19 buttons 1 joystick and 11 tabbed menus. Major features rely on physical controls can be set by feel while looking through the viewfinder. Menus ares used for options. Wheels have stiff resistance making accidental turning unlikely. EOS veterans whould feel at home and will barely need to crack the manual. Most controls can be reprogrammed. I configured the joystick for direct selection of AF points and assigned center AF point to the DOF button. Menus can be configured too e.g. group favorite settings under a single tab. The menus are well organized with options on a single page.VIEWFINDER: The viewfinder shows 100% of the image at 1.0X magnification and is the best APS-C viewfinder I've used. The focusing screen is not user replaceable but the transmissive LCD display--transparent LCD over the focusing screen--can simulate five AF patterns grid and plain matte screens. The red AF display flashes may be changed to dark gray or disabled. The viewfinder data display is bright and easy to read.AUTOFOCUS: The 19-point cross-type AF array is the most significant 7D innovation. The center point is a double cross. Imagine two superimposed crosses: rotate one cross so the arms fall in between the axis of the other. A F2.8 or faster lens is needed to enable high precision double cross sensitivity. With slower optics it reverts to normal precision and single cross.  Off-center points are cross point and can snag almost anything. Although the 7D has double the AF points of the 50D the AF area is the same size. AF selection via joystick is precise and quick.My disappointment with 19-point auto select is active points can't be directly overridden with the joystick. Instead press the AF selection button use the M-Fn button to cycle through modes until single point AF appears and finally select the AF point with the joystick! Oddly individual AF points may be chosen in 19-point AI servo. However the selected point is a starting point for AI servo tracking: focus is handed off to each of the 19 points as the subject is tracked across the frame.My compromise for the problem above is to use Zone AF with center point assigned to the DOF button. Zone AF behaves like 19-point AF but limited to one of 5 user selected zones. Zones may be chosen directly via joystick and if pin point accuracy is needed or it misses press the DOF button to narrow AF to a single point within the active zone. Essentially it becomes 5-point AF with the DOF button. Release DOF button to return to normal operation.Spot AF reduces AF point size for precise control of the focal point ideal for macro and portraits. Why not use normal Single point AF? Normal AF points are large and may cover both the eye and eyebrow in a tight portrait locking on the more contrasty eyebrow. Reducing AF point size insures an eyeball lock. Spot AF is the most significant focusing breakthrough of the past 5 or 6 years. It's not for everyone but makes macro and portrait shooters happy.METERING: Sixty-three zone metering debuted in the EOS 1D Mark III and filtered down to the 7D. Evaluative metering integrates color data into the algorithm and is better at avoiding overexposure of reds. It's a minor improvement over 35-zone metering of XXD cameras but better in tricky lighting. Exposure compensation (EC) is adjustable to +/- 3 stops. Metering is more biased to the active AF point than earlier EOS DSLRs i.e. the object you focus on has more weight in exposure calculations. In Zone AF where a group of AF points lock the exposure is more averaged.FLASH: The retractable E-TTL flash is great for fill flash and snapshots. AF assist is the main gotcha--pulses like a disco strobe--but can be disabled. The popup also functions as a wireless E-TTL flash master using light pulses to trigger compatible Speedlites. If you use auto-ISO with flash it defaults to ISO 400. Often that is not high enough for balanced fill in low light and too high for fill in bright light so you'll need to dial in ISO settings manually.Flash exposure compensation (FEC) in -3 to + 3 in 1/2 or 1/3 stop increments FE Lock (M-Fn button) and second curtain sync are available in the flash menu. Flash exposure is normally accurate and I rarely need FEC save for very dark or light subjects. FEC has a dedicated button and can be set without taking your eye from the viewfinder.IMAGE QUALITY: At low ISO there isn't much improvement over 50D RAW files. That's not a bad thing as the 50D is excellent at ISO 100-400. However 7D high ISO shows significant improvement over its predecessor with reduced noise especially banding. The 7D pulls off a great ISO 800 and a good 1600. With default DPP noise reduction files are fine for nice 11 x 17 or 13 x 19 inch prints. In a pinch I wouldn't hesitate to use ISO 3200 with noise reduction.APS-C cameras are less tolerant of underexposure than full frame models. I shoot RAW ""expose to the right"" and pull back exposure 1/2 stop or so prior to converting to TIFF. The resulting image is cleaner than normally exposed ones. Avoid AutoISO and select settings with less noise: ISO 160 320 640 and 1250 rather than 200 400 800 and 1600.FINAL BURB: The 7D is a nimble precise and capable instrument and a significant upgrade over the 50D. Durable construction and top AF performance make it great for outdoor action. However the 7D is not for everybody: heavy and the plexus of features insure a long learning curve. I've owned it over four years and it still delivers in spades.",0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Canon Review  January 31  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have purchased this camera a few years ago and fell in love with it. I have worked my way up from a Nikon Coolpix to the Canon 60D to the last-step before upgrading to a full sensor camera. Although this camera's replacement Came out just last summer I'd still prefer this over its replacement due to several reasons:The CMOS sensor it employs are great as is and have been in use for many years since their inception. In comparison to the never Mark 2 modelI couldn't see many differences in quality of the images. especially at night. Also due to the fact that both have dual sensors the speed at which they shoot is very minute only 2 frames more in the Mark 2 model.The second feature I enjoyed using with this model was the ease of accessing the menu using both the center console and the joystick. The buttons felt a little stiffer but also spongy when pressing themThe third feature is the structural integrity you feel when holding it. It is made a metal alloy so it is stronger dust resistant and water resistant.Even though it has all these great features it does have its short-falls for example:No tilting swivel screen like many Sony Nikon or lower Canon cameras. If you want to have full on of the HD film capability a screen that can be manipulated should be a top priority.Another shortfall is the nine point autofocus points. Even though you won't usually need more such as the sixty-three on most full frame cameras it's good.But more would be better.And finally the plastic LCD screen reflects to much light. On the Mark3 it uses glass rather than a soft plastic that can scratch easily. I'd rather spend more on a few more luxury features.frankly the replacement model doesn't have many features either such as a manipulative screen glass screen or even touch screen or Wi~fi.If you are someone looking to upgrade from a simple dslr camera like the Canon 70D or Nikon D 300 this is the right machine to take you to the next level in photography. It is more important to invest in better glass than camera bodies. Since the Mark 2 came out I'd stick to its predecessor.,0

Cart,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am not going to talk your ear off. If you are looking at this camera then you probably have a good idea about it. At the moment it is the flagship camera of Canon's small sensor cameras. It is built like a tank weighs about the same but that heft gives you confidence in its build and function. I love it. I have done family portraits to Quinceañeras and it always performs. Remember that lenses that are not specifically made for the crop sensor are going to have a telephoto effect not a huge issue but something to keep in mind. All of Canons ef lenses will work of course on this camera.The lens that comes with it is a good lens a great starter lens in fact. But you will want to upgrade. Quality glass is everything.The onboard flash works well but dont expect professional results and not beyond 15 feet. Invest in a good flash as well.I have no regrets in buying this camera and it really is a joy to use. This can be used as a basic point and shoot but why would you? It can do so much more. Learn the camera read the manual watch online tutorials then you will start shooting it like it was meant to.,1
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       7D to shoot RAW video with Magiclantern firmware hack  November 30  2016By R. Mena,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought my Canon 7D in “Just Like New Condition” for the sole purpose of installing the free Magic Lantern firmware hack to be able to shoot RAW and MLV (RAW 2.0) video and to take advantage of most of the features it offers like the ETTR tool (Exposing To The Right) sound meters etc… in other words converting my DSLR into a baby digital cinema camera that comes close to competing with a Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera that also shoots RAW video but is usually double the cost.The main difference between the BMPCC and the 7D (shooting RAW) is 13 stops of dynamic range versus the 7D’s 11.8 stops. 13 stops for the BMPCC is very impressive for a camera this price but if you learn to light correctly (especially using the ETTR tool) 11.8 stops is nothing to sneeze at either… again about half the cost.Out of all the Canon DSLR models only three cameras can really take almost full advantage of Magic Lantern’s firmware hack features (which is free) the 5DIII 5DII and 7D specifically the ability to shoot RAW & MLV video until the CF card is full. The other Canon models like the T5i/700D can only shoot RAW/MLV video for about 10-15 seconds and not come close to max resolution because of the limits on the memory buffer. The 5DIII costs about four times the price of a 7D and about 2-3 times a 5dII. As far as I can tell the 7D is essentially the 5D version but with a smaller APS-C sensor and the 5D series is highly respected among professionals.As mentioned the 7D does not have a full-frame sensor but it’s APS-C sensor is about the size of cinematic Super-35 sensor! Also the smaller the sensor your camera has the harder it is to find lenses made specifically for it especially prime wide-angle lenses. But Canon just came out with the Canon EF-S 24mm f2.8 wide-angle prime lens that you can find in ‘Just Like New’ condition for $120 here on Amazon! On average you’d be lucky to find one wide-angle prime lens that costs less than $300 with decent f-stop of at least 2.8 (decent boke i.e. blurry background) for even smaller sensor cameras like micro 4:3’s it becomes even harder to find at a decent price.You can still use full-frame lenses on the 7D like the very awesome ef-50mm f1.8 prime lens that costs like $115 “Just Like New” and gives you good boke! But the EF 50mm is made for the full-frame sensor and because of the 7D’s smaller sensor it crops the image and so it makes it behaves more like a 80mm lens… which basically means your going to have to back away farther from your subject matter to fit them in your frame. The EF-S 24mm and EF-50mm (80mm on APS-C) prime lenses are great basic prime lenses to start off with and will probably use 90% of the time and you can purchase both for less than $240! Good luck finding anything that resembles this lens combo for this price. Heck good luck finding one prime lens for another camera model for the same price of two lenses!The biggest concern I had with using Magic Lantern to shoot MLV (RAW 2.0) video was that my 7D would over heat because I was shooting RAW video. Not to worry I shot a short film for a week straight during one of the hottest parts of the summer in San Jose CA with an average temperature of 85 degrees with the windows and doors closed inside a house (sound recording purposes) and even though my actors and I where sweating buckets my camera never had any heating issues and I might have had to re-started it a couple of times but it always bounced back. The only issue I did encounter is that about every 20th shot came out with a green tint but it was so rare when it happened that it almost not worth mentioning but I like to be honest. And that issue has not come back since writing this review and I have shot more since then.I won’t kid you the learning curve for Magic Lantern is steep but not impossible and their website is chockfull of forum help.Cons:It only has 11.8 stops of dynamic range in era where Nikon and Sony DSLR’s are producing about 14 stops.No flip screen.,0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Great for the Professional Ameteur or Hobbyist.  April 2  2014By amazonman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I originally purchased this camera for photos of my family.  This camera has excelled at that.  The pictures are very sharp - you'll have no problem having large portraits printed.  In fact the largest print I've had made is 24"" x 36"" and it's crystal clear.  So far I've only used EF lenses but I'm seriously considering the EF-S 10-22 for wide angle group shots.The build quality is fantastic.  This camera has a magnesium body and can really take a beating.  Check out the Chinese guy on  youtube to see what I'm talking about.  I'm continuously pushing buttons and using the dials and have never had a problem.  I can see where the screen can get scratched if you aren't careful but to date my screen still looks like new.I've now had this camera for about 18 months and I've learned the controls and can take beautiful pictures but I have to admit that I wasn't impressed with this camera at first.  I couldn't seem to get a sharp image and had considered sending it back to Amazon.  I'm glad I didn't because with some practice I've gotten very good with this camera and am now getting requests to take pictures for friends and neighbors.  I've never charged anyone for this so I call myself a professional amateur.To sum it up this is a really nice camera and I feel that you can't go wrong.  Sure it may not be a 5d MKIII but it doesn't cost as much as one either and to be honest I can't really tell a big difference in image quality between the 7D and 5D anyway.  Maybe it's just me.",0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        16 of 16 people found the following review helpful       An excellent choice for serious amateurs and semi-pros  November 6  2011By TC Shooter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought my Canon EOS 7D with the 28-135 mm lens from Amazon just over a year ago. Since then I've taken about 20000 photos and had to work with Canon's service department along the way. So now's a good time for a review. I've been a serious amateur photographer for more than 50 years. I don't take snapshots; 99% of my photos are taken with the camera on a tripod. I take a lot of pride in my photos and hundreds of them are published on several websites I own or manage. I wanted a camera that was so good I couldn't blame it for a bad photo but not so expensive I'd be limited in what other photo-related items I could buy.My intention when buying the camera was mostly bird photography so I also bought the 100-400 mm L zoom lens. My interests also extend to close ups and the 60-mm macro lens got added to the package. Since then I've added only two more lenses to my kit: the 10-22 mm EF-S wide angle and a used Sigma 600-mm mirror lens. Accessories? Oh yes we have accessories!One problem with APS-C sensors is greater image noise especially at higher ISOs. The EOS 7D produces very low-noise images at ISO 800 though I rarely go there. While photographing a night-time prescribed fire in Jonathan Dickinson State Park I kicked the ISO up to 6400 and shot with the 10-22 mm EF-S lens wide open (f/3.5 to f/4.5). Those shots were for the web and even at 1200-px width the noise is bearable. In fact for something as dramatic as a night-time forest fire the noise seems to add veracity. Most of the time I shoot at ISO 100 or 200 and large prints look wonderful. (Don't handicap yourself with cheap filters or a flimsy tripod. Accessories can add significantly to the start-up costs of a system like this so figure them into your budget from the beginning. If you're just getting into DSLR photography stick with the camera and 'kit' lens and get a high-quality clear or UV filter. I always recomend a tripod but good ones are pretty expensive. Autofocus and image stabilization may make tripods seem irrelevant but tripods make you slow down and pay attention to the shot. That would be a good next purchase.)The sensor and in-camera processing are important but so is the lens. The supplied 28-135 is acceptable though not on par with better fixed-focal-length lenses. Its greatest fault is the 6-blade iris which causes sub-par background blur but I've been able to fix that up pretty well using Photoshop's ""Lens Blur."" If your program has Gaussian blur and you know how to work with layers you can fix the problem so most people won't notice and the lens does have its benefits.For one it focuses down to about 20 inches (0.5 m) which is very useful if you're a nature photographer. Schneider makes a +2 diopter achromatic (dual-element) close-up lens with the right thread and that lets me focus down to about 10 inches even at 135-mm (more than 200-mm equivalent on a full-frame 35-mm camera). (Canon makes an equivalent achromatic +2 diopter lens but at this writing you can't get a new one in the U.S. and used ones are commanding high prices.) I've gotten some astounding photos of dragonflies and other insects with this combination. The depth of field is limited so you need a tripod and it doesn't hurt to manually focus.Ah here's the thing: If you're an automatic-camera type the 7D probably isn't for you. Yes it has built-in options that will think for you but you can get them for less on say a 60D or a point-and-shoot. The 7D is a photographer's camera like a Porsche is a driver's car. I've never used the full-automatic features and don't miss them. I tend to use Aperture Priority and set Exposure Compensation to underexpose by one-half f/stop. I also use the Histogram to look for potential problems (you can see the Histogram before shooting by switching to Live View mode which you can do by pushing one button on the back of the camera).One feature I especially like is the ability to shoot at 8 frames per second. Great for birds in flight and butterflies. If you shoot only JPEG-format an 8-GB CF card holds more than 1000 images. If you shoot RAW+JPEG you can store about 250 images on an 8-GB card. As I don't do sports photography occasionally changing memory cards in the field is not a big problem and if a card goes bad I'll lose fewer images. I have two SanDisk cards and alternate them and so far no problems. I download images to my PC via the USB connection.I did have a problem with the camera though it was my fault. The body is claimed to be water resistant but that's not exactly right. I shot outside all summer here in South Florida and a couple of times I dripped perspiration on the flash hot shoe. I _thought_ I wiped it off but some must have gotten inside and corroded the hot-shoe terminals. The camera thought there was always an 'unidentified' external flash on board so the internal flash wouldn't come on. And it wouldn't recognize my Canon 580EX II flash when I slid it into the hot shoe though I still could use the flash. This problem cost me $450 to fix but Canon had the camera back to me in less than two weeks and their website kept me informed of its progress through the repair facility.Since I got the camera I launched a website devoted to the natural history of the county I live in which means taking lots of photos of flowers plants trees and insects as well as my favorites birds. It's the nature of APS-C sensors to produce greater depth of field which is overall a benefit when shooting close ups. Getting wide with an APS-C sensor means using an extreme lens but the 10-22 mm EF-S (usable only on APS-C cameras) does the job. Never have I wished for a full-frame DSLR (only the $$$ to afford one!). If the market recovers I will probably buy a second 7D so I don't have to change lenses when that neat bird flies over while I'm hunched down shooting a flower with the macro lens. I would definitely recommend the EOS 7D to any photographer with interests similar to mine. I studied the manual and purchased a copy of David Busch's book which travels with me in the car. Take the time to learn the camera and don't be afraid to try different settings (keep notes so you know what you were doing when you review the photos). Most of all get out and shoot shoot shoot!",0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        16 of 16 people found the following review helpful       Excellent Balance of Price vs. Features  August 22  2011By B. Coots,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,On it's merits it's a fantastic camera that is well covered in other reviews here. If you're trying to decide between this and the 5D Mark II here's some thoughts to consider.The 7D is nearly identical to the 5D in terms of specs in fact beats it in a few areas:- dual DIGIC processors on the 7D means 2X faster continuous shooting of 18MP RAW stills (the 7D shoots 8fps just slightly behind the 10fps of their $5k cameras!)- the 7D has a much better much improved auto-focus system vs. the 5D- when shooting video and monitoring on an HD monitor the 7D works as expected whereas the 5D drops the signal to standard definition when you hit record so you're seeing the wrong size and aspect ratio while you film.In the end the 5D's only real advantage is its full frame sensor which will deliver slightly reduced noise more narrow depth of field and since there is no cropping a 50mm lens is 50mm. Those are pretty much the three benefits of the 5D over the 7D. The depth of field issue is the one most often mentioned by those of us who use these cameras for shooting video but consider this - a crop sensor is roughly 25x17mm and motion picture film is 22x19mm. In essence this means you're getting depth of field very similar to what audiences are used to seeing in feature films with the 7D.The 5D Mark II is almost $1000 more so you really have to ask yourself if that extra sensor size is worth it to you. To me the 7D represents the absolute best balance of cost and performance on the market.,0
DSLR Cameras,B002NEGTTW,Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        8 of 8 people found the following review helpful       Very capable APS-C camera  February 13  2013By Edward V. Hawk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I ordered mine a little late to the game; my Canon 40D had the shutter fail and I debated long and hard on what would be a true upgrade to that camera without breaking the bank.I wasn't in the market for a full frame camera so that narrowed it down to a used 50D (a new one cost more on Amazon at least than the 7D) the new 60D or a new 7D.60D missed a few key points on my check-list - auto-focus is key in motorsports photography which while not my primary focus is something I do frequently. Build quality was another concern and it seemed as though Canon really dumbed the 60D down deliberately from the 50D (or 40D for that matter) to save a bit of manufacturing costs. Less dedicated buttons no joystick worse auto-focus and while yes it is cheaper by a few hundred dollars my feeling of value for $ just wasn't met.The 50D I actually really liked; not a super upgrade from the 40D and if I could have found a new one for $800 I probably would have gone with it. The fact that it cost the same or more than the 7D on every site I could find it on put it right off my list.Onto the 7D - first the autofocus. Head and shoulders above the 40D 50D and 60D. It's sick. You have to use it to see what I'm talking about but selectable area from the joystick or 19 point selection or autoselect; usable and fast. I will say that the liveview has more issues with focus than without; this isn't something I use very often but when I do its noticeably slower. However manual focus from liveview is great; a click of the + button and you can go from 5x to 10x magnification on the screen to get that perfect focus - the display is high quality and really helps lock in focus when you use it in this manner. Good for tripod/portrait shots (not something you'd use in situations requiring fast focus anyway)The menu system and features are very well laid out; if you've used a Canon camera this should all be familiar anyway and there are a few extra bells and whistles coming from the 40D that I noticed; primarily autofocus but being able to limit autoISO is a nice feature as well (if you own this camera and don't have that update your firmware). Ridiculously fast burst speed - I mean 8fps is getting close to full motion; if you need speed and don't have $8000 to spend on a camera the argument is over get the 7D.Image quality - better than the 40D which is to be expected but not lightyears ahead. I'd expect images between the 50D and 7D to be fairly similar. Having the extra pixels to play with is always nice; 18MP for me is fairly future proof. I think excellent results can be had to ISO 1600 - very usable at 3200 for web based images; 6400 ISO is pushing it a bit but still usable for web and black and white.View finder is excellent. The autofocus and grid display are both unobtrusive and usable. Battery life is great. Camera is actually pretty lightweight weather sealed as well.Is it with the $1200 Amazon charges? Yes. Is this a futureproof camera? For a mirrored full sized SLR I'd say yes. I would never need a FASTER camera than this. I'd be hard pressed to justify more MP than this even more so on an APS-C sensor. Digital cameras have just come so far from where they were a few years ago and this being an older camera I think like film cameras of old will end up becoming a classic. I thought about buying this used but I didn't want to have to worry about the shutter being replaced in a year so I just bought it new.Video - no idea. Haven't shot any. Reviews show its fairly awesome so thats as far as I can go with that.Honestly I don't think there is a better Canon APS-C on the market at the moment and the next version of this will likely cost $600 to $800 more. Hence I just bought it new and hope to enjoy it for years. Bottom line if you need the speed and the best auto focus system on the market (right up there with the 5D Mark II Mark III or 1D Mark II) I think you'd be happy with this purchase.If you don't and just want a decent APS-C camera? Save a few bucks and get the 60D.,0

It drove me crazy and I returned it. I got my replacement and it's silent.DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! -If something feels off about your camera when you get it look it up! It could be normal and it could be a major flaw. Know before it's too late so you can get a ""good"" copy.Pros:  BEST BODY CONSTRUCTION ON THE MARKET!!!!  8FPS!!!! (Great for wildlife/Action)  AMAZING Servo AF.  GREAT video.  AMAZING outdoor performance.  Feels great in my hands very sturdy.  Weather sealing  In camera RAW (can save time when prepping a shoot with white balance etc.)  3 custom user image profiles  Great layout very intuitive for canon users.Cons:  Not the sharpest camera. After many side by sides with my Rebel Xti the IQ is pretty much the same unfortunately. I am keeping my old 5D for portraits and landscape/lowlight.  Not so hot in Low light. Try not to push too much above 1000. Decent noise control but it shouldn't need to control it in the first place (Ideally)  Battery grip doesn't match camera grip ergonomics at all.  Battery life could be a touch better.  It suffers from being too awesome sometimes.Bottom line:I am NOT sending it back. I am excited to use it for what it was designed for.If you are strictly a landscape/portrait photographer get a different camera.If you are a wildlife photographer you will LOVE this.If you are thinking that a better camera will make you a better photographer save your money and try cooking.If you have the money and want a great all around camera go for it!",0
DSLR Cameras,B005MTMFHU,Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with…,        31 of 31 people found the following review helpful       The Camera I've Been Waiting For....  November 17  2011By Elisa 20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've held off buying a digital camera getting by with a simple point and shoot and a cell phone. The last time I took a serious look at digital cameras there were two main kinds--point and shoots and DSLR. The point and shoot was ""okay"" for snapshots. The DSLR was the one you'd get for image quality and control over all the elements of photography (thinking back to film camera days.../old).The point and shoots were functional pocketable and simple. The DSLRs were sophisticated complicated and heavy (lenses...you would want to have lenses....)  Oh and DSLRs were really pricey especially getting the lenses (the kits? Not such a good idea). I bought a point and shoot and always felt ...""eh..."" about it. Not very exciting if you want to pursue photography as a hobby (as I used to do with my old 35mm Canon A-1 which I loved).So imagine my surprise looking around here a month ago and finding there has been a sea change in the digital camera world. Not only have the prices gone down for everything--what an array of choices there are now in all categories!--but the technology the capabilities of even so-called point and shoot cameras is now pretty amazing. And you get so much ""still camera"" PLUS video too.So...I narrowed down my choices and tried to decide: ""Canon T3i...or Canon s100?"" Two different concepts both very versatile but one easy to slip in a pocket or purse the other...feeling more like what I still think of as a ""real"" camera--interchangeable lenses hot shoe for the flash RAW and...with video..a nice capability to have an external mike.While I was thinking I went over to [...] (Canon Talk) forum where they were discussing the same thing: What to get?And I saw images from the SX40 (which I'd never heard of --and just came out 2 months ago so no reviews yet). Fantastic! And the zoom! 24mm so nice and wide. 840mm at the telephoto...amazing!  All compact and lightweight for what you got. A new genre called a ""superzoom"" or ""bridge"" camera coming between the point and shoot and the DSLRs. And actually costing LESS than the s100!!!After deliberating for a month between the s100 (which I'd ordered but wasn't in yet) and the T3i I had found ""my"" camera. In less than 24 hours of finding it I ordered.  And really it was love at first sight.There is so much that's great about this camera and Canon lays it all out well on this page. You get the idea--as much (or as little) creative control as you want. If you don't like to fiddle with controls just put it on ""P"" and you'll get great pix without doing anything except ""point and shoot"" (well and focus and stay still). But if you like to ""grow"" with a camera it has a menu button that is easy to scroll through settings that are easy to use a mode dial right on the back that makes everything easy to find a ""record"" button for video that is colored red so you can't miss it...couldn't be easier...or more fun!The only other things you might want to know are: it has a hot shoe but doesn't shoot RAW (which I don't care about but people who are heavily into post-processing are). There's no way to attach an external mike of your own but the internal mike has two different settings and a wind filter--so better that most sound-wise. I put a 67mm lens adapter on to prevent vignetting and added a clear filter to protect the lens that and a good memory card and a case and....good to go! I can't recommend this enough--it is a really fun camera (oh and has macro as well) and using a long zoom like that is just really exciting if you like photography at all. (Check out the pics of the moon at dpreview. Amazing).  Highly recommended.",0

October 13  2011By Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,First off let me state that I never write reviews but I'm so happy my doorman had this waiting for me yesterday evening. After getting acquainted with my new camera a bit I have to say it's truly a big step up from the sx30 (which I also own). The camera seems more responsive overall. The auto definitely works better. Pictures are crystal clear. And low light pictures are simply amazing. I even tested ISO 3200 with a nightlight and it produced a usable image with very little noise. Also since the camera is more responsive to low light the zoom seems to work much better because low light zoom pics are very clear and have negligible noise.. This camera is simply a wonderful value for the money. Buy it.,1
DSLR Cameras,B005MTMFHU,Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with…,        38 of 39 people found the following review helpful       Excellent camera--Canon finally got it right!  October 26  2011By caaron,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had both of the predecessors to this camera--the SX20 IS and the SX 30IS.  The new processor in this camera really works where those were 'iffy'.  Stabilization is excellent even at 840mm (equivalent) and the pictures are crystal clear with minimal chromatic aberration and fringing (means they are sharp and relatively undistorted).  The burst mode is fantastic--you can shoot up to 8 frames at 10 frames per second with this camera and it really works the way it is supposed to.  It even uses the programmed settings and will do exposure bracketing in burst mode.  My only complaint is that the zoom framing assist button (which is the same as the one on the SX30 IS) is placed where your thumb would normally be so it is difficult to shoot without inadvertently pressing it which is why I didn't give it a 5 star rating.  The zoom framing assist button itself is very helpful because it is difficult at full zoom to find a fast moving bird in the frame so it allows  you to back the zoom off temporarily until you can re-acquire the image and then zoom in to shoot it.  Picture quality is excellent with the new Digic 5 image processor often rivaling the quality of pictures I've taken with my DSLR.  This is a great all-around camera that although it is not pocketable is small enough and light enough to take anywhere.,0

Rose,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this camera a month ago and I've passed the 2000 picture mark so I guess I'll jump in and provide a review. I upgraded from the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS to this one and I've been thrilled with some of the new features and less than thrilled with others.The quick verdict:This is a great camera for anyone who wants lots of features and versatility but doesn't want to use manual settings and doesn't travel a lot.Pros: great zoom range nice picture and video quality improved low light performanceCons: ISO locked to 100 with >1 second exposures proprietary Li-ion batteryHandling:The camera is a bit bulky as you would expect from a camera with a 35x zoom lens but I quickly got the hang of handling it. I tend to accidentally hit the zoom framing assist button when shooting. It seems to be right where my thumb wants to be when holding the camera especially when switching between landscape and portrait orientation. I had similar issues with the SX10. I'm not sure I like the memory card being slotted in with the battery on the bottom of the camera. Access to the battery/card slot is blocked when attaching the camera to a tripod quick release plate.Zoom capabilities:The zoom range is a nice feature. The size of the full moon is about 1/5th along the long side of the image at full optical zoom and close to 850 pixels across. On a clear night you can get some nice detail. Clipping the Raynox DCR-250 macro conversion lens on at full zoom and using a light box for trans-illumination I was also able to take pictures of microscope slides at 125x total magnification on a 150 dpi test print. They look better than the images I took with a scope and CCD camera at the lab. Very nice!Image quality and low light performance:The image quality under low light and high ISO conditions has improved compared to the SX10. I took some images of kittens at the shelter in rooms that were poorly lit. With the SX10 I would end up with a lot of motion blur and noise on high ISO (800) images. Comparable images look better with the SX40 but some processing artifacts are visible when looking at the full size of the high ISO (1600) images. The camera ultimately was not able to stop the motion of kittens at play without the use of flash though but I was expecting that under the poor light conditions.External flash:Speaking of flash the camera works well with the SpeedLite 270EX flash. The hot shoe can be covered with a plastic cap for protection when not in use. It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to take the cap off but with a closer look at the design once you get it off it becomes obvious. Having long enough fingernails to get under and lift the front of the cap makes it easier.Filters and lens accessories:The lens can be fitted with the same 58 mm Lensmate filter adapter as the SX10. Thin filters will work fine at all zoom settings but thicker filters like a circular polarizer or stacking several filters will cause vignetting at wide angle. A little bit of zoom or a 67 mm filter adapter may help avoid the vignetting issue. The lens cap that comes with the camera will no longer fit once you put the filter adapter on. And speaking of the lens cap - Canon put a tether on it so it can be attached to the camera thus reducing the risk of losing it compared to the non-tethered cap of the SX10. While that is a plus the SX40 does not come with a lens hood like the SX10 did. That would need to be purchased separately.Settings:One thing I miss on the SX40 is the ""sunset"" preset under the SCN options that the SX10 offered. Out of all the SCN options on the SX10 that one probably saw the most use when I wasn't in M or Av mode so I'll have to figure out an equivalent setting on the SX40. The snow beach and foliage settings are all still there so why did the sunset disappear? The new settings such as miniature seem intriguing but I haven't really gotten into exploring that yet.Overall the camera has a lot of good features. So why would I give it only three stars? There are at least two things that I would consider design flaws.Battery:Let's start with the battery. This is a so-so issue some good news and some bad news. The good news is the battery weighs less than the SX10's AA batteries lasts longer (for about 1000 pictures) and fully recharges in under 2 hours while I often have to let the AAs recharge over night. The bad news is it is much more expensive to get a spare and inconvenient for travel. With the SX10 I could fly overseas and use my mom's batteries and charger in Germany in case I forgot to bring mine. If needed I could rely on AA batteries being available at a souvenir shop or gas station. With the proprietary battery pack if I forget to take the charger and 220V adapter with me or don't have anywhere to plug it in the camera is dead once its battery pack runs out of power. You can't just buy a spare one at a gas station. If you have a spare battery pack in your possession you have to package it according to TSA safety restrictions on Lithium batteries if you take it on an airplane. So there's a lot more to consider when traveling with this camera. If Canon offered the same camera with the option of using AA batteries I would probably opt for that instead of the battery pack just for the sake of convenience when traveling.""Manual"" mode limitations:The bigger issue though is that the camera does not have a fully manual mode. Sure there is the M mode setting but it has limitations. I noticed it when I took some night shots and the camera changed my ISO setting from 400 to 100 as I increased exposure time in M mode. When I tried to reset the ISO it told me ""ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed."" The camera manual explains under Tv mode that when shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or slower are used the ISO speed is fixed to ISO 100. However there is no warning about it on the page detailing M mode and I did not expect to find any limits in manual setting as it wouldn't really be manual then.I emailed Canon support about it and they clearly did not get what I was asking about so I called phone support. The guy I talked to was clearly not expecting this limitation either and at first told me I probably had a faulty camera and should send it in. However he was then able to reproduce the effect on his camera much to his own surprise. He had to check with someone and finally came back with the information that the limitation is built into the firmware by design to ""prevent overexposure and hot pixels on the sensor."" No plans to upgrade the firmware to change that. He recommended cranking up the ISO to 3200 at 1 second exposure. That's not really what I wanted to do though. It's a bit of a joke really or even insulting to any photographer who knows what they're doing in M mode.It is possible to get around this limitation using a CHDK hack. However at this time there is only a buggy alpha version of CHDK available for the SX40. I gave it a try and while the ISO override worked it wasn't the ISO I had set it for. E.g. setting the override at ISO 400 gave me pictures with ISO 640 and setting it for ISO 800 gave me ISO 1250. Regardless of the option of using CHDK this limitation is like putting a child lock on M mode and it's a farce to call the resulting feature ""manual mode."" So that is my main disappointment with this camera so far.Instructions:Last but not least I was also disappointed that Canon does not provide a printed manual with the camera. All you get is a PDF on the accompanying CD. It is set to print in postcard size which results in a lot of white space and waste of paper when printing it. The resulting binder weighs more than a pound in paper weight. Neither the PDF nor the print out are useful as a reference in the field at least not for me. The tech support person I talked to quickly promised to get a printed manual sent to me at no charge when I mentioned it though so a phone call might be all it takes to get one. I haven't received it yet but when I do I shall report what it looks like.The verdict:Overall the SX40 is a nice camera with some great features but unfortunately it is prevented from performing to its full potential by restrictions that Canon designed into the firmware. Canon's ""design"" of locking ISO settings in manual mode is almost an insult to more advanced hobby photographers and it is clearly misleading to still call it ""manual"" if the camera is allowed to override the photographer's choices in settings. I don't think any other camera model in this quality and price class does that. However those who do not use M mode routinely will probably hardly notice this limitation.",1

November 8  2011By Camera girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Although I've just gotten this camera I can tell you that it is the best point and shoot I have owned. I have two dSLRs a Canon rebel and a 5D. The SX40HS's image quality surpasses the Rebel (DIGC 2) and is just under the quality of my 5D. I previously used a Canon S2is and a Lumic DMC-LX3 and this camera beats the S2 tremendously in all aspects of photography while just beating out the LX3 in short range zoomed photos. I only have two minor problem so far; one that is that sometimes at full zoom the photos can look out of focus if you're not careful. Two when shooting at high ISOs as most point and shoots the photos can get a little noisy and are useable up to ISO 1600. Other than that there really is nothing wrong with the camera it's a great voice for any serious amateur or pro looking for a point and shoot for daily use.,0

March 24  2013By Kevin Irwin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I originally bought this camera five months ago to replace a stolen Canon PowerShot SX230 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Blue). In those five months this camera has not let me down at all.First of all it takes very high quality images for a non-SLR which you should be able to see from all the sample images laying around this site and elsewhere. It's also very ergonomic and feels very comfortable to hold. My two favorite things about the physical design are the zoom lever and the flip-out rotating LCD screen. The control dial is very nice too and operates smoothly. Also the mode dial can rotate infinitely meaning you can continue to turn it after reaching the last notch instead of having to turn it in reverse to get back to the first selection. There is also a fully customizable self-timer option on the dial which can really come in handy.The in-camera controls are very intuitive. For most users the Auto and Scene modes will speak for themselves and get the job done very well with minimal controls for the user to deal with. Those who prefer to shoot in Manual mode and/or dive deep into the main menu will be delighted at the many options and customizations available. There are so many options to choose from and the menu is easy to navigate.Lastly the zoom is excellent. 35x may be a bit excessive for most occasions but the option is there and the results it produces are great. All in all this camera doesn't really have any flaws I can think of that would warrant anything less than a full five-star rating.,0

For pocket cameras I've had several Canons over the last 8 years. My S95 goes along with me almost always. Now the SX40HS blows me away! The zoom range while retaining image quality and camera user friendliness is unbelievable. The lens alone is worth the price. The surprise that got me (and I thought I knew everything!) was the value of the electronic viewfinder (EVF). While not the highest resolution and a bit tricky to center your eye on the EVF allows easy shot confirmation without taking your eye away from it zooming in to check sharpness and exposure even in full sunlight where evaluating a washed out LCD image while composing or in playback would be difficult.  Of course there's always a trade-off - it's hardly a pocket camera. But carried in a light jacket pocket or a medium sized purse you can still have near DSLR versatility with less weight and a smaller size. The 12Mp resolution (vs. 16Mp) keeps the image from falling apart at high ISO's as well as Canon's ability to retain detail with noise reduction using Digic 5 processing.,0

Barr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've been using the Cannon SX40 HS now for over six months and I am rather pleased with the product. My primary objectives for it has been to obtain quality digital photos of birds and close-ups of wildflowers. The SX40 has excelled with both objectives. The features have allowed me to photo distant birds at maximum zoom and I obtain a clear focus image that can be editcropped and enlarged. The stabilizing features of the SX40 are outstanding. At maximum zoom I give the auto focus features a few seconds to find the target and bingo a great shot. I can take over twenty shots of the subject in less than five seconds. With quick selection of macro zoom for close-ups I can capture a close image of the smallest flowers with the lens nearly touching the petals. This is an easy to use high quality camera packed with features designed for digital photography. My only complaint involves the position of a display image button which I often accidently engage and this results in shut-down of the lens. I'm getting over 300 photos on the battery before it needs to be recharged. I wish it had a setting for manual open of the lens for night lightning shots. The SX40 and the software is superior to the Olympus Zoom cameras which I previously used before upgrading to the SX40. I give this product a five star rating and I would buy it again.,0

June 28  2012By Wayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,We took the new camera on a recent Caribbean cruise.  The photos are sharp and the color excellent.  Even photos taken in low light conditions are superb.  Photos taken in sports mode are blur free; as good as our Canon EOS Rebel.  Image stabilization is better than any camera we own.  The 35X optical zoom works flawlessly even when shooting video.  Videos are clear.The use of flash deserves special mention.  The camera will flash only when the flash is manually raised. This is a great feature because it allows low light shots without going to the menus.The controls and menus are straight forward and easy to use.Battery life is incredible:  300+ shots with a mixture of flash and non-flash.The only negative is that the Canon SX40 HS is that it is a bit bulky.  But when you consider that photos are equal to our Canon EOS Rebel which is far bulkier and requires multiple lenses to get the same zoom range the slight bulkiness is okay.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01N7OJNAI,D5600 DX-format Digital SLR w/ AF-S…,        52 of 55 people found the following review helpful       Nikon's Best Budget DSLR. Highly recommended!  January 12  2017By Chris Winter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Hey whats up everyone my names Chris Winter and today I’ve going to do an indepth Review of the brand new Nikon D5600 to see if it’s a good camera for you. Let’s review the brand new Nikon D5600.Build QualityLet’s first get started by taking a look at the build quality and features of the new Nikon D5600. When you first pick up the Nikon D5600 I’ve got to say that it really does feel nice. The Nikon D5600 is targeted towards either beginners or photographers who want to step up from a begginer camera and I think it fits the purpose. It’s not a huge camera but compared to something like this camera here the new Nikon D3400 there is a noticable step up in size. Button placement is good too. Nothing too different from other Nikon bodies so if you’re used to the Nikon system you’ll feel right at home. So overall the Nikon D5600 feels great it’s not too heavy and its not too light its right in that sweet spot for a DSLR.LCD ScreenLet’s now turn the Nikon D5600 around and take a look at the LCD. And this is where things get exciting. The Nikon D5600 is one of a small number of DSLR’s from Nikon to have an articulating screen. And it’s a good one at that. Compared to some cameras from some other brands the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is the real deal and can even be flipped to face you in the front. Now that might seem like an insignificant feature but for people who film themselves like I do that’s a huge deal and will mean this will be a great camera for youtubers. Not only that it really does allow to get shots from up high or down low which is normally a dificult thign to do if youre just relying on the viewfinder. The screen itself is also really quite good. I was very impressed with the screen from teh baby brother the Nikon D3400 and the Nikon D5600 is equally as good. One thing that I really loved about the Nikon D5600 is it’s touch screen. I really don’t know why more DSLR’s don’t include these as they make it them much easier to use. So overall the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is definitely impressive and one of the highlights of the camera.MenusSo I quickly wanted to touch on the menus on the Nikon D5600. Overall they were quite good with a lot of information and settings at your finger tips. Now if you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR you’ll feel right at home in the menus on the Nikon D5600 but if you’re coming from a Canon background it might take a while to get used to. So again the menus are pretty good. They’re fast to get around and if you’re used to Nikon you’ll feel right at home here.CompetitorsNow if you’re thinking about purchasing the Nikon D5600 theres a good chance you’ll have looked at some of it’s competitors. Firstly on the cheaper end the recently released Nikon D3400 is another option to look at. It’s cheaper than the Nikon D5600 but importnatly is missing the articulating screen and the touch screen. The Nikon D5500 is the Nikon D5600’s predecesccor and is actually pretty similar. One thing it is missing htough is snapbridge which could be something you’re interested in. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse feature which is missing on the Nikon D5500 which is somehting we’ll talk about later. On the higher end we’ve got the Nikon D7200. It’s a little bigger and has great autofocus but doesn’t have an articulating screen and is also more expensive. On the Canon side the Nikon D5600’s big competitiors are the Canon T6i and Canon T6s and also perhaps the Canon 70d and Canon 80d. The Nikon D5600 does have continuous auotofocus in video mode but if compared to cameras like the Canon 70d or Canon 80d it’s still not at that level. It works but I wouldn’t bet my life on it. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse mode as well which is a really nice inclusion. This was included on the Canon 80d and i actually found mysefl using it quite a lot so having it on the Nikon D5600 is nice. And if you do like to shoot in slow motion the Nikon D5600 can shoot at 60frames per second so you can slow it down it post nice. So overall if you’re looking for a great DSLR for video the Nikon D5600 might not be the best but it’s good.So overall I’ve been very pleased with the Nikon D5600. Is it a huge upgrade from the Nikon D5500? Well not really but this is a great camera not only for photographers but also for those interested in vdieo as well. Good job with this one NIkon.,0
DSLR Cameras,B01N7OJNAI,D5600 DX-format Digital SLR w/ AF-S…,        35 of 38 people found the following review helpful       Consider buying a D5500 instead  January 17  2017By Bryan Pfaffenberger,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this camera (with the 18-55mm VR II kit lens) from Amazon in order to replace a much-loved D5100 that was stolen. The camera has all the plusses I loved in the D5100 especially its light weight and reticulating LCD. In addition the basic D5600 kit now includes the much-improved 18-55mm VR II lens which is incredibly sharp and useful. Focus is now adjustable by touching the focus ring on the lens rather than flipping a switch. And the LCD like the competing Canons has touch-screen capabilities making use of the menus far easier (and faster).  I compared the D5600 to a D7200 the flagship of Nikon's DX offerings and found quite simply that I took much better photographs with the D5600.  The size and weight of the D7200 militated against spontaneity in my shooting. Admittedly I would have gotten used to this in time but even so the D5600 to me offered all the crucial flexibilities of the D7200 in a far more user-friendly approachable context.  I found it far easier to shoot the D5600 in aperture-priority (A) shutter-priority (S) and manual mode (M). To be sure you don't have two dials but the single D5600 dial can control both shutter and aperture simply by holding down a button. The bottom line was the D5600's featherweight construction. I'm a huge believer in the adage ""the camera you have with you is the one you will use.""  Let's face it:  the competition is the iPhone's camera and I've taken a hell of a lot of great photographs with it. The D5600 is light enough to make you stop and consider lugging it with you iPhone and all.I'm less than enthusiastic about the single major improvement over the D5600's predecessor the D5500:  Snapbridge. The low-power Bluetooth connection is capable as I ascertained at transferring large format images to my iPhone 6S but the transfer is inordinately slow and consumes battery power voraciously.  Although the camera still has wi-fi like its predecessor wi-fi is now wholly subordinated within Snapbridge such that the user cannot choose between Bluetooth and wi-fi. There is one positive:  So long as you have your smartphone with you the Bluetooth transfers can be configured to encode your pictures' GPS coordinates but there's a major downside to this:  If the pairing doesn't happen for some reason and the transfer happens elsewhere the coordinates will be wrong.I regret to say that I pulled out my D5100's EyeFi card and plan to use it instead of Snapbridge to transfer full-size images to my smartphone; in my experience at least it's 10x faster. Or better I'll simply pull the SD card out of the camera and stick into the slot on my MacBook Air.  The unfortunate truth is that the D5600 offers very little in comparison with its predecessor the D5500 and buyers might well consider saving $100 by foregoing the most recent version of this camera.This year marks Nikon's 100th anniversary and for me personally the 40th year I've owned and photographed with Nikon products. It is with sadness that I note signs of Nikon's desperation in the face of smartphone competition. In order to cut costs evidently this camera kit does not include the camera's reference manual an indispensable item for serious photographers and it isn't available on Nikon USA's site at this writing. Personally I'd prefer to have a printed manual rather than a 300-page PDF.In spite of my criticisms I must say that I absolutely love this camera. Its light weight reticulating touch-screen LCD crystal-sharp optics from the 18-55mm VR II kit lens and beautifully thought-out controls have enabled me to take dozens of memorable perfectly-exposed photographs.  The built-in flash is surprisingly useful producing shots free from red eye and obviating the need for an expensive add-on flash unit in many situations. Aside from time-lapse movies a feature I haven't evaluated I see little in the 5600 that isn't already available in the D5500 at a reduced price.",0
DSLR Cameras,B01N7OJNAI,D5600 DX-format Digital SLR w/ AF-S…, The camera is all I wanted it to be and ...  February 21  2017By Eastern Shore GuyVerified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The camera is all I wanted it to be and even more....however having said that due to problems with SnapBridge I have knocked the whole package back to 3 stars. Nikon needs to refine how SnapBridge is paired with the camera or iPhone or iPad. On several occasions the same photograph was transmitted from the D5600 over 300 times to my 7 Plus iPhone. What a hassle having to delete over 300 of the same photograph. Thinking the my iPhone 7 Plus was the problem I then paired the D5600 with my iPad and got the same results with another photograph...over 300 times. I will say 99 % of the photographs I took paired perfectly but it's that one percent that created major problems for me. This is obviously some sort of software glitch. Has anyone else experienced this same problem....it is absolutely driving me nuts.  Help!!!!,0
DSLR Cameras,B01N7OJNAI,D5600 DX-format Digital SLR w/ AF-S…, Terrific upgrade!  And GPS link to phone works great!  February 12  2017By Mark StieglitzVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Awesome after week two seems much much better than my D5100 in low light and the touch screen is nice.  Picture quality is awesome.  Snapbridge works for me but seems to take a lot of power so I disabled downloading of photos to my phone.  I upgraded mostly to get GPS tagging from my phone which works great.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        660 of 691 people found the following review helpful       Stunningly Good! An Insane Value!  November 25  2013By 7 Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I got this camera as an upgrade to my beloved D5100 so the bar was pretty high and so this review is often D5100 vs. D5300. I'll be frank. The D5300 outclasses the D5100 so substantially that it has utterly obsoleted the D5100. Ignore those who say that the D5300 merely provides an opportunity to pick up a D5200 or D5100 for a bargain price. No. The D5300 is now the ONLY camera in the Nikon D5xxx line. It has changed the game. Don't bother counting pennies this camera is underpriced at full price. The fact that I am sincerely comparing images from this $800 camera body to my D800E's images truly says it all.Please allow me to just get into the Pros and Cons:PROS:1) PHENOMENAL IMAGE QUALITY! AT LOW ISO THE D5300'S IMAGES ARE ON PAR WITH THE BEST CAMERAS IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS NO EXAGGERATION WHATSOEVER. I can't believe there is still a debate going on about the efficacy of Anti-Aliasing filter removal. I'm sorry but the difference is so noticeable there is no debate. And moire was a myth even on the D800E which I do also own. I guarantee you that you will find more moire in a D5100's or D7000's images than you will on the D5300. Color and saturation from the D5300 are exceptionally good versus ANY camera at any price point. Now I will still take the D800E's images over the D5300's but it is not at all night & day. They are actually surprisingly close at low ISO.EDIT 2013-12-09: Photographing cats a lot I am catching a little false color on shiny fur. Nothing of concern to me though.2) Focus point spread (area of image with AF sensor coverage) is MUCH greater than in FX (""full-frame"" sensor size) cameras. The D5300's AF point coverage extends left-right top-bottom much farther than FX cameras. I would estimate the D5300 covers probably double the area that FX cameras do and this is an ENORMOUS advantage. I always leave my D800E's focus point glued to Center because the AF coverage is only in the center area anyway so why bother with the other 50 AF points when they just don't cover anything? I actually do use my focus points on my D5300 because they cover the frame pretty well. I'd still like to see even more coverage but vs. the FX bodies APS-C cameras have a tremendous advantage.3) Minimum shutter speed in Auto ISO now has AUTO setting that adjusts based on focal length! This is SO much better than a fixed shutter speed regardless of lens length.4) Hard to quantify but the HDR images look much nicer than the D5100's and the Extra High setting is intense and beyond the D5100's abilities. I have not been able to verify this but it *appears* as though there is now image alignment for the 2 photos used for the HDR image as my handheld HDR shots nearly never look like 2 images whereas they often did on my D5100 at full or nearly full magnification. HUGE improvement!5) Great-for-DX and pretty-good-versus-FX ISO performance. I'll put this to bed right now; the D800E smokes the D5300 for high ISO performance. Sorry this is a different league. However the D5300 substantially outperforms the D5100 at ISO 1600+. The improvement in the D5300 over the D5100 is readily noticeable.6) Much more intuitive i Menu. The D5100's i Menu being J-shaped was ridiculous and totally awkward. I never got used to it after thousands of photos. The D5300's standardized 2-lines-across-the-bottom Nikon style is a drastic improvement.7) GPS! I don't know what Nikon was thinking with that clunky expensive GP-1A. Did anyone ever buy one? The D5300's internal GPS works great and hooks up quickly and I'm big on geotagging so I am super stoked to have this on a REAL camera!EDIT 2013-12-09: I spent a day in the country (wide open clear sky) with this camera outside of my normal metro town area and despite using A-GPS data it took somewhere between 30-60 minutes to get GPS lock. Surprised disappointed. But that was the only time I have had trouble with hookup.8) Nikon's had truly exceptional built-in flash performance since at least the D90. The D5300 does not disappoint and bests or matches its predecessors at any price point. This could be a result of image processing more than flash performance but whatever it is using flash is a joy not something to dread.9) The red body paint color is super-gorgeous! It's like a candy apple red Corvette color and it is way sexy.10) The new bigger higher-pixel screen is REALLY nice. It is not insignificant like many reviewers dismiss it as. I like it a LOT. :)11) EN-EL14a battery with 19.4% more capacity is a nice treat and helpful when running GPS and/or the silly WiFi. I have not spent a full day shooting hundreds of photos with the D5300 yet but I have shot perhaps 100 shots in a day with GPS on and flash here and there and a lot of reviewing and in-camera editing and not gotten below 2/3 battery level in a day.EDIT 2013-12-09: GPS was on from about 8:45am to 5:30pm WiFi was off all day I shot 362 photos (almost all were 14-bit RAW+Large Basic JPEG so roughly only about 170-190 shutter clicks) and probably 15 of those photos had flash 2 minutes of video edited 6 photos and had a couple of review sessions during the day. Battery level fell to 1/3 remaining. Not bad but could be better. If you're a heavy shooter and will use GPS and/or pop-up flash carry a spare battery.12) Here's a gem for the old-school film guys like me. ;) Or a little ""secret treat"" for digital-era photographers with a true creative streak. In Manual exposure mode the ""T"" or ""Time"" setting has returned! Want to take a 5-minute or 5-hour exposure but you left your plug-in intervalometer/timer at home? Lol as if you even have one... No problem. Turn your shutter speed dial all the way past 30-seconds past Bulb and click on into good ol' Time at the end of the dial. Press the shutter button to open shutter let your wristwatch or phone tell you when exposure time is up and then press shutter button again to close the shutter. Seriously?! Yes seriously. How cool is that?! I miss this so much and guess what? Even my D800E does not have T and the D5100 does not either. According to the Nikon info page for the D5200 (Yes D5200. Not a typo) T is there but you need the ML-L3 remote to use it.CONS:1) EDIT 2013-12-09: I have found that focus points other than THE Center focus point are somewhat frequently inaccurate. Focus points at or near the left and right edges are rarely accurate and almost never dead-on. If you use ONLY the Center focus point focus accuracy is quite good and consistent. As Center AF point AF-S is almost always how I shoot this is not a deal-breaker for me but it is certainly a handicap. If you use multi-point AF tracking or regularly venture away from Center AF point you had better experiment with different AF points at a local camera store before buying one from any store Amazon included. I am beginning to think my camera may be defective and will likely send it to Nikon for repair or exchange it with Amazon for a new one. Honestly I expect this to be a performance trade-off that Nikon will not remedy. Though $800 is not cheap this caliber of image quality for $800 is going to come with trade-offs and I bet being forced to use Center AF point is one of those trade-offs.2) EDIT 2013-12-09: I had a chance this past weekend to use Live View in some beautifully sunlit countryside. Sorry even with truly ideal lighting Live View is horribly slow and constantly hunting. Don't use it for anything other than manual focus confirmation with screen zoomed for precise focusing. And focus VERY slowly as screen update time has substantial lag. I'm not really concerned about video but this camera cannot focus worth a darn for video. It really is that bad sorry.3) When reviewing a photo on my D5100 and even the D5200 I could just press the OK button to get into Retouch Menu and then get into RAW processing of that image in another click of OK. Boom 2 presses of OK and I am RAW processing the image I'm looking at. Well not anymore. Now I have to press the ""i"" button to get into Rating/Retouch/Send Menu and then click OK to get to Retouch Menu and then another click of OK to get to RAW processing. Hardly a nightmare but takes an extra button press and more importantly is ergonomically awkward and more prone to mistakes.4) Noisy Multi-Controller. I like having solid clicks but man clicking Up Down Left or Right on this Multi-Controller is literally enough to wake someone up. My gf grumbles at me for reviewing/RAW processing in bed because of that. It's also not so great in public areas as it intrudes on the conversations of neighboring tables etc. It's really an irritating higher pitch that grabs attention. I know this complaint sounds whiny but it truly is an intrusive noise problem.5) WiFi is rubbish. You can't upload full-resolution images to your smart device via WiFi. And I don't believe (but I could be wrong about this) that you can WiFi upload at all to a PC. I wanted to have instant constant file backup via WiFi. Nope.6) Slow RAW process Menu navigation. Perhaps it's the sheer file size but things like scrolling Picture Control modes in RAW processing is very slow relative to the D5100.7) Slow photo review after taking a picture(s). Takes too long for the D5300 to gulp down one or a few RAW+Large Basic JPEG shots (my standard resolution).8) After assigning HDR function to the BKT button (D5100)/Fn button (D5300) activating HDR now requires holding the Fn button and turning the dial until you get the setting you want before letting the Fn button go. On the D5100 you set your HDR preference one time in the Menu and then activation via BKT button only took a single press. Now it's a process. And my favorite setting (High) takes the most clicks (3 to the left or 3 to the right) to get to. The Auto HDR mode should simply be removed so we just scroll Low Normal High Extra High and should be permanently Menu-set to facilitate 1-press activation a la D5100.9) To get autofocusing you MUST use an AF-S or AF-I lens. D5300 body has no focus motor for AF or AF-D lenses. Metering requires a CPU lens.CONCLUSION:The D5300 is not a camera for sports when rushed or in demanding conditions and you are gambling when you change away from Center AF point. Many consumer cameras like to claim performance in this fast-action realm but no. If it's not pro gear it will suck at sports and tracking a subject. Always has been and likely always will be the case. However for general photography landscape portraiture/still life macro time-lapse etc. the D5300 creates stunningly sharp and colorful images able to be painlessly enlarged to enormous proportions. I wouldn't hesitate to print 3-foot x 2-foot (that is 36x the size of a 4-inch x 6-inch) prints. And that would be essentially pixelation-free. 6-foot x 4-foot would still look fantastic.",1
DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        26 of 26 people found the following review helpful       The D5300 for YouTube work and D3100 comparison  July 10  2015By Eshcole,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"For those who like video go here for a quick look - https://youtu.be/AsyukB3j4zkFor more details keep reading!Now I'm coming from the Nikon D3100 which I used for all my YouTube videos up until now so I'll be comparing to that. I'll also be coming from a YouTuber point of view. If you need a professional review for your pro film or photography work please find a better review. It's amazing how much more you get with this camera considering it feels just as light as the D3100.Some of the extra features you get from this upgrade:Higher ISO RangeBetter ISO scaling (instead of jumping up 100 to 400+ ISO with every knob turn. You can go from 100 to 125 for example)24MP sensor over 14MP (if you want to take pics that big)MIC portBetter built-in mic(if you use that)WifiMore auto focus points(39 from 11)Movie Live View ModeFlip-out Viewfinder (and that viewfinder is slightly bigger as well)Cleaner Software Interface1080p @ 30fps or 60fps..too name a fewAlright so how have these upgrades helped my YouTube videos?The Flip-Out viewfinder not only helps me to find focus easier but it also helps me see when I'm properly in the frame or not (like when I'm telling people to check the description or cards above) without having to stop the video and play it back on the camera or check on my PC. With my D3100 I needed to use PC monitor as a viewfinder to make sure everything was in focus and center frame while showing a product or speaking. However please note that the viewfinder on any DSLR camera will always be too small to guarantee focus in many situations. Focus on the viewfinder then shoot a few seconds of video then check on your PC to make sure you're actually in focus if you find yourself constantly slightly out of focus. Of course you can always just buy a separate monitor that's made specifically to replace the DSLR viewfinder and show you the colors and focus properly which usually cost a couple hundred dollars or more but if you're happy with your current DSLR and just want a better viewfinder I recommend going that route.The MIC port now gives me the option to record audio straight to the camcorder if I wanted to with quality mics. I do have other people in my home that shoot videos as well on other channels and they stay very close to the camcorder as they record cause they don't like using external mics. Now they can get better audio on their videos by plugging in a shotgun mic. I'm personally a fan of the external audio I capture with my Zoom H1 and Giant Squid Lab lavaliere.Better ISO scaling and higher ISO range helps me get the lighting for my videos just right without creating noise in my shot. Lighting doesn't only depend on the actual physical lights but also on the DSLR capabilities. The D5300 allows for more minute changes to the ISO so I can go up by 25 ISO for a subtle bump in brightness to get my picture just right without having to jump up over 100 ISO than go fiddling with my F-stop exposure etc. like you have to with the D3100. This combined with the better sensor also helps when taking product shots outside in low light or anytime I don't feel like setting up the studio lights just for a few good pics.1080p @ 30fps or 60fps is awesome. On my D3100 I was limited to 23fps which is not a bad thing considering most movies you see nowadays are shot in 24fps but I kinda like how motion looks on my videos in 30fps compared to 23fps. Combined that with the previous points on ISO and my videos are looking loads better. On another YouTube channel with my bro where we talk about local and world news I shoot in 60fps cause there's a ton of motion from laughing to hand and head movements as we're talking about each story so I shoot in 60fps. The user will actually see a bump in overall video quality from it as opposed to when its just me talking on my personal channel and 60fps doesn't matter as much.Movie Live View Mode is a god send for many but for me it's just another nice option and I don't use it often. You're limited to F1/30 or higher in this mode but you can now see immediate changes to your shot as you make them like when you change you ISO or change your F-Stop without having to come out of Live View and go back in. It can save me a little to a lot of time in some situations like when shooting outside and the lighting suddenly changes.The 39 auto focus points ensures that the camera focuses fast and the D5300 is noticeably quieter when taking a picture which improves the photography experience a lot.Alright so no problems at all?Oh there are a few problems.The MIC Port placement could've been a little better. Due to the big flap over the port if you plug-in anything to them you're going to be blocking the viewfinder partially when it's flipped out.There's something strange going with one of the lighting settings (exposure f-stop iso) but I don't know which one cause as I'm filming video the lighting suddenly changes very subtly every now and again and this is while I'm on Manual mode indoors with studio lighting so I'm not sure how that's possible.The button placement is quite different on the D5300 than the D3100 as well. The Function (Fn) button (which is set to be your ISO button by default) the ""i"" button and every button that was on the side of the viewfinder on the D3100 has a new placement obviously due to the viewfinder flipping out and I'm not exactly a fan of the new placement.The ISO button is slightly higher and closer to the flash button so I accidentally pop up the flash when trying to change ISO on the fly. I kinda did that already with the D3100 but it was not a big problem cause the button wasn't that close but it's actually closer on the D5300 which is quite frustrating.The different shooting modes used to have a lever you slide back and forwards to switch between them (continues single timed quiet shutter). Now you have an awkwardly placed button way down between the Lens release button that's difficult to reach without looking. At least you have a remote mode now which I don't think the D3100 had at all.Alright that's it. Thank you reading this and I hope it helped you a little in your buying decision.",1

DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        15 of 16 people found the following review helpful       Loving This Camera!!  January 4  2016By Karengail,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I love this camera! I am just a beginner who finally decided to take the plunge and get a DSLR. I went back and forth between this and a Canon T4i and finally chose this after a lot of research and reading tons of reviews. I mostly liked how small and comfortable it is and the reviews seem to point to better image quality over the Canon with no anti-aliasing filter and better low-light performance. I liked that it had built-in WiFi and GPS. I did struggle mostly with not wanting to give up the touch screen on the Canon and that is something I really wish this camera had. Overall I have been very pleased with my decision and have been taking tons of pictures. I find the battery life to be quite decent- I have gotten a couple of spares and always keep one handy. I did get the 18-140 kit lens based on the reviews. I was fairly satisfied with it for a while but did find I wanted more reach and ended up buying the 50-300 telephoto which I really do love and find I can get much better close-ups and detail than with the kit lens. I mostly like to take pictures outdoors of ducks squirrels birds and nature in general. The picture quality is outstanding.  Colors are gorgeous and the pictures are sharp and beautiful.  The auto-focusing is quick and precise and even when zoomed in or heavily cropped I am still thrilled with the results.I do have arthritis and ergonomics is important to me.  I love how this camera feels-  It feels solid and well-built but it is also lighter in weight than a lot of comparable models.  The grip is perfect for my hand and I can swing this camera by my side just holding it by the grip and it feels perfectly secure.  I take it pretty much with me everywhere because it fits easily inside my purse as well.I did have an issue with something smelling like burning rubber and the unit was quickly and easily replaced by Amazon so that was no problem really. I have owned this camera for over a year and have been quite happy with it.I am not thrilled with the video but can't say I've really given it much of a chance. The internal focusing noise drives me crazy but I am told an external mic would alleviate that. The flash works OK but I rarely use it because I just prefer natural light. I will hopefully be getting a speed-light but just not in the budget yet. I have found that if I go into the menu and change the flash compensation to  -2 or -3 that the pictures come out a lot better.  without looking so washed out.I have come across a few issues but there are a lot of things I need to learn so don't know how much is the camera's fault and how much is user error but sometimes I press the shutter and nothing happens!  This drives me crazy because I feel like there is plenty of light and why won't it take the picture?!! I also have found that it is sometimes because I am too close and it is not able to lock focus which again means nothing happens when you push the shutter button. I think as I said most of that is because of user error or improper settings so I just have to keep learning. I often will just throw it in to auto mode and then I am able to get the shot.  I guess this camera refuses to take a bad picture!  I will say that auto mode does work quite well and I have taken some beautiful pictures in auto.  This camera is way beyond point and shoot but if someone wants to use it that way I think they will be thrilled with the results they get.I do want to address the problem of WiFi connectivity that most reviews say is fairly dismal. It will pair load a few pictures then disconnect. It is quite maddening because you have done everything the manual says to do and it just doesn't work. l am happy to say however there is a simple solution which I came across randomly while searching the web and it works like a charm. You must first set your phone with airplane mode ON and then turn WiFi ON. This is not covered in the instructions given by Nikon but it totally works and WiFi connects perfectly and stays connected as long as you need it. I have not tried to use the GPS because of the negative reviews. They all seem to point to it being mostly useless and a huge battery hog. I haven't tried it and probably won't so you are on your own with that one.I think overall this camera is fairly user-friendly.  One thing I really like is that Nikon has this handy dandy little ? button that is extremely helpful. Pressing it brings up a mini-tutorial on whatever function you happen to be messing with at the time. I have found this to very useful indeed and for a newbie it is fabulous to just be able to get an instant explanation without having to go searching through the menus or look something up in the manual.  The rest of the buttons seem well-placed and easy to learn for the most part.  The only problem I have with button location is that I often hold the camera in a way that my right thumb hits the right arrow of the ""trackball"" and causes my focus point to move to the right. I do this ALL the time and it is quite annoying. It is a simple matter to hit the middle of the trackball and bring the focus point back to the middle but it is frustrating how often this happens. The auto-timer/burst/remote shutter button is kind of hard to locate as it is in an obscure spot hidden down on the left hand side of the front but I am getting faster at finding it when I need it.I can say I am quite happy with the image quality and color rendering as well as ease of use and handling. I do not have enough experience to do any kind of meaningful comparisons but for me it is the best camera I have ever owned and the more I learn the more I enjoy it. I think it makes a great beginner camera although it might be overkill for a beginner.  Possibly the d3300 would be a smarter choice due to being much cheaper and a little lighter. They both have the same 24.2MP 23.5x15.6 mm APS-C sensor and expeed 4 processor. I do like the articulating screen on this camera which the d3300 doesn't have. The D3300 does have in-camera panorama stitching which I think would be cool to have but Nikon has omitted it on this camera. It can of course be done in post but I still would like to have it in camera. There are a number of creative modes available which might be fun but I've not played around with them so can't really comment on them. I did see a video made in the ""toy"" mode which was kinda cute so I might try that.I do have to say that I am quite pleased with the beautiful pictures I have taken with this amazing camera even with my limited expertise. The quality blows away any camera I have used in the past and being able to capture something beautiful to enjoy and share is after all the whole reason for all of it. I am now and intend to always remain an amateur who just wants to capture the best images of life as I see it and this camera has shown itself to be a good partner in that endeavor. I am extremely pleased with my decision to buy this camera and very happy with Amazon's customer service and promotional financing. I expect to enjoy this camera for many years to come and would recommend it to anyone trying to learn digital photography. I only wish it had a touchscreen!",1

August 6  2014By Herb Lippe Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this as a package with the Nikkor 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6 DX VR G lens from Beach Camera via Amazon. What an EXCELLENT combination. I chose the D5300 over the D7100 simply because of the articulated rear screen.I upgraded to the D5300 from my D5100 which I now use as a back up camera.  I was convinced that the 24.2 megapixels from the D5300 would produce sharper images than my D5100 with only 16.1 megapixels...and I was right.I love the sharper images I'm getting from the camera. The larger LCD articulated rear screen is a great help for my older eyes.  It has essentially the same features as my D5100 so the transition is really easy.The only thing I would have to say that might be negative are the focus points.  The D5300 has a choice between 11 or 39 focus points.  I like the fact that the focus focus points show more in focus points on the subject but I miss the red LED single point focus on the D5100. I just like the red LED's better. The 5300 has grey squares instead. I was trying to shoot the inside of a flower the other day and I kept getting 3-5 points on the petals instead of inside.  Just something I will get used to.The packaged 18-140mm lens that came with it which I wouldn't label as a ""kit lens"" makes this an excellent combination and good for all-around photography. I think that this lens by itself retails for approximately $500 but the package brings it down to a savings of about $150 to $200.I'd definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone.",0

I bought this camera because it was at a lower price point for an entry level amateur photographer and I've been having a great time with it.I've used this camera mainly for photographing friends and family nature/scenery my dogs and random still-life scenes that captured my attention. I haven't really captured action except with the video.Pros:1. Light weight (for a DSLR)2. Good beginners camera. Controls not too difficult to learn (the user interface helped me get used to different ISO aperture and shutter speed settings)3. Swivel screen is very useful especially when taking videos low to the ground or photos above a crowd.4. Great battery life (new to me compared to point-and-shoots)5. WiFi useful for quickly transferring photos to a tablet and emailing to friends and family.  I haven't used the GPS function though.Cons:1. DX format (starting to learn about the limitations versus a full frame (i.e. more expensive) camera2. Video focus tough to use (I guess I still have a lot to learn :P)3. Lenses are expensive and there are soooooooo many accessories out there (my wallet is much lighter than I anticipated)4. Settings can be a bit cumbersome and overwhelming for a beginner but I'm getting the hang of it.I definitely recommend this camera but I would recommend getting the only the body if you plan on picking up additional lenses (starting with the $200 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor). I bought this camera with the 18-55mm VRII lens which is a good beginners lens. I've stopped using that lens since I got the 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor and haven't used the kit lens ever since.Overall this is a great camera and I've been having a great time with photography. At the end of the day the camera is only a tool but I'm glad I got this one and have no regrets about it.,0
DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Better than I expected!!!  February 27  2016By .,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Just received this yesterday and started shooting today. My first Camera other than an iPhone so I am a 100% novice but wanted something I could grow with. Amazing photo quality! I will post the first day photos I captured today all on automatic setting. I did not change any settings and I must say I am amazed at how well this camera adjusts for shutter speeds and aperture size. The auto focus on both works amazingly well and I don't see the need for any other lens JUST yet. This bundle came with a software CD called viewNX2 and I'm not sure what it does other than shading and cropping...haven't really spent time on it yet but I do like the fact that it shows every spec/dynamic of each photo that you take...ie...shutter speed / aperture / focus setting / ISO / where the focus points were!  The Bag is well made with a handful of different size Velcro pieces to allow the user to compartmentalize the space how they see fit. The bird photo was at 300mm. And the picture of my girls was about 230 mm. The holly tree branch was at 55mm on the 18-55. Again I don't know enough about photography yet to go manual so these were all point and shoot.,1

DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Perfect for the evolving enthusiast...it is ok to leave your D3200 behind and upgrade!  January 17  2016By T. Haight,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this a few days ago here on Amazon. I brought a slightly used one with just over 3000 shutter actuation's. Saved a LOT of money. I came from the delightful rank-beginner D3200 camera to this upgrade. Here are my thoughts after 2 years of shooting with a D3200 and upgrading to the D5300:1. Stellar upgrade in sharpness! Without a doubt the most noticeable thing. 39 autofocus points over the 11 on D3200 really helps! That irritating OLPF is gone! I use a 37"" monitor to develop in Lightroom and pixel peeping on the D5300 is a delightful experience. My friend who owns a D7200 thinks the image quality is identical. It is close my friends. Too close to call.2. Smaller and lighter than D3200 but still substantial enough in the hand. Anyone with slightly smaller hands will really enjoy this camera. Me? I am 6 4"" with big hands and it still felt just great. No issues there as far as I can see.3. Your EN-EL-14 batteries will work in it. The D5300 is recommended and comes with EN-EL-14a. Battery life is just fine. To make a guestimate from the 150+ images shot and no budge on the battery meter...500-600 may just be possible without heavy flash use. I should not admit this but even an aftermarket battery I used in my D3200 for 2 years works perfect in my D5300. No issues at all.4. A surprising find: This much better body has really helped me get a LOT more from my lenses. I kid you not friends. The 35mm f/1.8 from Nikkor remains sort of a disappointment but still shows improved image quality on the end of the D5300. The ""Fantastic Plastic"" Nikkor 50mm f/1.8 really shines though on this camera! sharp sharp sharp!!! Lots of light through that big 58mm thread size. It was a performer with the D3200 and really pairs well with the D5300. My old 55-200 VR likes my D5300 as well and has also shown a sharpness bump. If you can believe it even the kit lens 18-55 from the D3200 takes better pics on the end of the D5300. We all know good glass is important but often times it seems that good quality bodies get down played even though they are also a very important part of the overall photographic equation.5. You are going to have to make some out of the box adjustments. The irritating focus lock chirp for one. I had to shut that off. The AF illuminator is irritating as well and also had to be manually turned off.6. Control lay-out: For God's sake take the time to learn the differences if coming up from from D3100/3200 series cameras. It takes a while to learn the new placements and new hand motions to adjust on the fly. David Busch's guide to the D3200 was great for me and I have purchased his D5300 guide and expect similar excellent tutoring as well. I highly recommend and you can buy here on Amazon and read on Kindle.7. ISO is a LOT less noisy on this body. Seriously. 1600 ISO looks great compared to many D3200 shots at that sensitivity. Even the one 3200 ISO shot I took for giggles was way quieter than I expected it to be.Overall my fellow Nikon geeks this is a great upgrade still within most of our financial means. Next gen performance free of the OLPF and just a real joy to work with. Some people complain about slow Live View but I could care less. The good friend who got me into photography suggested I learn to get it as right as I could in the camera first and to stop using anything but the view finder. 3 years later I am glad for the wisdom he shared. Live View needed maybe for video or some other sorts of shots...but for us View Finder clickers who peep it later this camera is going to be a happy surprise for you.Bottom Line: If you can afford it (new or used from a reputable seller here on Amazon)...do it! You won't be disappointed in your next step up the DX ladder. The D3200 got you hooked and now the D5300 is going to take you to even better places and greater enjoyment and satisfaction from our chosen hobby.",0
DSLR Cameras,B00IDUNW72,Nikon D5300 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        19 of 20 people found the following review helpful       Great Choice  April 24  2014By Katie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Really impressed so far. I had an SLR years ago in film days and very much enjoyed using it. It was broken and for years I simply used point & shoots eventually moving into digital with an HP 1.5 mp. I moved up through point & shoots and started getting back to the context of framing a picture and the art of photography--especially once I started hiking in our beautiful area mountains a few years ago.I had a 4 mp Kodak at the time great little camera by the way that taught me the value of good glass-I still have it but found I wanted to move up to newer and better technology. So after considerable research  I purchased my Nikon L120. Very satisified and great pictures but I found in the last several months I wanted the versatility options and creativity a dSLR would offer. Yeah Now there's an expense right? And here was someone who knew not much about them having forgotten what she knew in the manual film days. I have friends who will lay their lives on their Canon's and not as many who would for their Nikons (and possibly might offer their Canon friends as sacrifices too) )-not that they aren't loyal to and love their Nikon there's just fewer of them. From earlier research I liked the image quality of Nikons just a bit better but still when you're spending a chunk of cash and if you're like me and are far far from the top 3% you want to make sure you're getting a good product and a reasonably user friendly one for your money.So after considerable research comparisons (to Canon) scrutinizing images for Canon & Nikons D3200 D5100 D5200 D5300 albeit not many with the 5300 since it was relatively new and reading reviews here on Amazon (one of the best resources in my opinion and '7's is a wonderful string with loads of interaction and advice) I started leaning towards the D5300 opposed to the other models and finally due the reviews and 7's advice I plunged and bought the D5300 with the 18-55 mm lens--the red one of course.I love it! I was a little frustrated at first with all the menus's and options. It seemed overwhelming but refer to the manual buy a book to supplement ( I ended up buying 2) come here and read and just play with it. As you start experimenting with it and changing settings and modes it gets less confusing and not as complicated as it felt at first. And it has auto modes so it's not like you can't get great shots from the start while you learn.One of the things I found is change your picture quality to fine it will bring an incredible realistic feel to your photo's. Images of my cat a tortoise shell are fantastic capturing the depth clarity and colors in her eyes and the contrasts in her fur giving a very living feel to the picture--not to mention the disdainful look she's giving the dog is very clear. Photo's I took of my neighbor picked up the green flecks in his blue eyes the lines whiskers and age spots in his skin making them look very lifelike. Captured him exactly and with a sharper depth than normally in a photo.Some have noted difficulty with action shots. I haven't done much but shots of my granddaughters jumping & goofing around captured them in mid air and did a nice job freezing the action. I also snapped some shots of my dog and his fur friends running outside and captured hair and ears flying as they ran in different modes--Sport and pet and I'm pretty sure some were in auto. I'm excited to take it out this summer to sporting and action events and see what I can get. I'm optimistic--if it can capture a flying shaggy Shih-tzu it's looking positive.I've noticed the single focus setting on auto doesn't stay put if you change modes and back but as far as skewing the image I'm not really seeing anything discernible or problematic. If you're taking a picture of a moving object you won't want it fixed anyway. To me the wandering (and by that I mean it isn't fixed to a central single spot not that it's randomly floating around) focus point is a little distracting when not fixed to a single point but that's just me being over aware of it at the moment I'm focusing on not focusing on it. Not a dealbreaker.I'm picky about image quality and I'm very satisfied with what I've gotten As I become more familiar with various settings I'm very much enjoying playing with it and look forward to learning more about a DSLR and what you can do with it.  This is a perfect camera for it and I absolutely recommend it to anyone stepping up to the dSLR universe.,1

What I like best about the camera are the options. You can leave it on auto in order for it to pick the best settings for you or you can play around with the settings yourself. The instruction manual is pretty easy to follow along with and I have read it twice at this point but keep it handy for questions as I become more familiar with the options and buttons that I'm currently using. There are a lot of buttons though so it might not be the right camera for someone who could be overwhelmed with that.Another great part about the camera is the resolution of the pictures - they are not grainy like you can sometimes get with the smartphone cameras. These pictures are going to come out clear.The basic package for the Nikon D3300 comes with a lens of 18-55mm. This is a good lens for landscape and portraits and general taking pictures for memories but if you want something very closeup or are taking pictures of something far away you will want to also look into another lens.,1

June 7  2016By Leo R Graywacz,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great camera for the price I got it at (Black Friday sale).  I have a D70s that it is replacing because I wanted the CMOS sensor for the much less grainy pics.  I do miss the extra dial on front.  The screen is close to 3x as large as the D70s.  24 MPs is nice when you need to crop compared to 6 MO of the D70s.The camera feels like a toy when you lift them side by side.  The D70s has a metal frame while I think the D3300 has a carbon fiber frame.  I've since gotten use to the lightweight feel of the camera and enjoy it.  When you put a long lens on it it feels very front heavy though.  Even though this is a consumer camera compared to a nearly pro of my recent camera the pictures it takes are quite a bit better.  The metering is far nicer then the D70sI'd recommend this to anyone.,0

My old Nikon Coolpix finally drove me insane enough that I needed to get a new camera. I was sick and tired of all my pictures being blurred our messes that had to be deleted later. I lost so many great photo moments due to blurred faces or disappearing limbs I wanted to chuck the camera across the room (I didn't of course then I would be down a camera and have to clean up one more mess). I wanted to try stepping into DSLR cameras without killing myself with an impossible price tag. I did a lot of research. I read side by side comparisons  read over 20 reviews per camera I was considering compared all the numbers and looked at pictures taken with the different cameras. I even went into Best Buy for an opinion and to see how the cameras felt in my hand. In the end I went with this one (the snazzy color was a bonus but not why I chose the camera). Let me tell you how excited I was taking pictures with this the first week. I would grin from ear to ear and pester my family telling them how clear the pictures were. To dispel any illusions here I will inform you that my kids are hardly ever still but I have pictures of my kids mid jump on the trampoline and throwing leaves in the air (you can actually see the shape of the individual leaves). The moment when my son grins while his GG hugs him was not lost because they were moving or the lighting was bad. I have used this camera inside and out in good lighting and poor and I have not been dissapointed. The in camera edit features are fun too. To sum up this camera is fabulous if you're not looking for the most impressive camera on the market but for a great camera to capture life's special little moments.",0

I hadn't flown in 12 years and I was glad to have the smaller camera along. The camera performed extremely well all week - impromptu family shots tourist and nature shots and 170 un-posed wedding shots. All on one battery charge with plenty to spare. The pictures are very sharp and close cropping is not a problem. And I like the red color.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00QW235AM,Nikon D3300 24.2MP CMOS DSLR w/…, Unbiased review.  February 23  2017By Ryan BellVerified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"To begin with I found this camera to be not very user friendly. Many times when I click down the shutter it refuses to take the picture and also very frequently it refuses to start live view which is required to take video and displays ""unable to start live view"" error message without giving me any reason why which doesn't help me fix the problem. Understandably this got me very frustrated. When I googled this ""unable to start live view"" message it basically gave me the options of resetting everything to factory default or it was because it was overheating. If it is overheating in only 57 degrees F after 2 minutes of use then that is a pathetic battery.  I went whale watching yesterday in Newport beach on a nice mostly sunny day and the pictures of it were appalling horrible. Out of the hundreds of photos I took there were only about 6 that were somewhat clear and there was about 7 that were very over exposed and the rest were somewhat blurry (of the whales when I zoomed in to them). All were taken in auto mode. To cut nikon some slack I (the photographer) and the whale (the subject) were both moving so it was in difficult conditions. To contrast my mom (standing right next to me in the exact same conditions) took pictures with my 2010 (much older) Canon SX20IS and got the same quality of shots with only half the megapixels (12MP). That is a huge red flag for me. Photos in shade in a canyon another time also turned out over exposed in auto mode.The reason why I don't give this a 1 star is because when I took indoor shots and outdoor shots of canyons (where the subject and I both weren't moving at all) it took impressive photos. It behaves pretty well in low light. To be fair the 60 fps video is also pretty good. In other words I've found this camera to be good for things that are not wildlife. Another contributing factor was my whale photos were on a 200 mm lens instead of a 500mm so I think they would have turned out better with a 500mm. I might update and change this review in the future especially if I am at fault and doing something wrong.",1

February 21  2015By Crystal Ingram,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was a bit worried about ordering this camera given that it's about $200 less than Amazon is selling the same camera for.

Hansen,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I just returned from a Rhine River Cruise and am ready to comment on the 70D. I've been a dedicated amateur for over 40 years and have been shooting with a 5DIII for the past two. I was intrigued with the real time auto focus and thought the 70D could replace my camcorder while traveling and maybe even the 5DIII. However I took both bodies and three lenses the 16-35 L IS 24-105 L IS and the 70-300 L IS. If you want a very technical review I would suggest; http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/. This is a great site for honest reviews.So here goes. Before leaving for Europe we took the grandkids to a fair with lots of rides. It was a sunny day with tons of light. The realtime auto focus worked perfectly. The video blew away my Canon XA10 but since the cam isn 't shooting through ""L"" glass that makes sense. I used the 24-105 L IS which became a 38-168 on the 70D. That's a great range for video. The lens focused quickly but quietly. The 16-35 L IS focuses faster but is very noisy making it a not great choice for video. The 70-300L IS is OK slightly noisy. In Europe I started out carrying both bodies the 5DIII with the 16-35 and the 70D with the 24-105. Great for quick shots without having to change lenses. The 16-35 was especially useful in those narrow streets with great architecture. On the 5DIII it's truly 16mm. On the 70D you would need a 10mm lens and they get very pricey. Comparing image quality isn't very fair since there's a big difference between the camera's in size and cost. The 70D's image is very good and if you weren't doing a direct comparison is more than acceptable. However the images on the 5DIII just ""pop"" even in Raw without tweaking. The color saturation especially the sky looks like there's a polarizer on. The 70D's are almost as good after some computer processing. All in all very impressive for that level of camera. Video was a mixed bag. In bright sunlight; awesome. In a ""lounge"" setting with low light some focus hunting and lots of grain. The superior ISO of the 5DIII really shows up here; but then it doesn't real time focus. A 5D with realtime auto focus would be the ticket!Bottom line: This is an incredible value. Unless you're a camera geek like me it will do just about everything you could want in a relatively compact inexpensive package. Stick on some ""L"" glass and you've got a winner.",0

I started using DSLR's mainly for videos on YouTube and dabbling in photography. Although I would say my Nikon was more user friendly for beginners- settings wise this was definitely the step up I needed. The main reason for making the switch was to find a camera that worked best for a one man show. The Canon 70D does everything for me and makes it that much easier. It's fast auto focus makes it easy to just hit record and start my video. I never have to ask myself ""am I in focus?"" or find myself surprised when I upload the footage into Sony Vegas. The flip out screen also helps in framing the shot by myself. Overall I upgraded to make my life easier when it came to filming and it did just that. If you are purchasing this camera for beginner photography I always recommend the T6i's to get to know the basics. But if you're willing to splurge a little I say hey why not. I love how quick the camera is in shooting photos and I never have to feel like i'm missing a shot. The LCD screen is also seamless and is very true to color.",1

Fleet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The bottom line is this is a fantastic vlogging camera which is the specific reason I bought it. If you're not interested in 4k if you're a 1 man band or just someone that wants to shoot a lot of great material and get it out to the world fast this might be the camera for you.Already being the owner of a Canon 5D mark iii and mark iv I am very familiar with the Canon brand. I do both still photography and videography equally.I endeavored to help my wife start up a lifestyle vlog and did a lot of research on cameras before picking this one. It made a lot of sense to me because I already own a lot of high-end Canon glass.  However owning full frame cameras I don't have too many super wide angle lenses that are better for this APC-S sized sensor. Please see below for a detailed analysis.VIDEOGRAPHY:Pros:-I love the articulating touch screen. To me this is the main reason this camera beats the pants off of my 5D's for shooting video. You can place this camera high or low left or right face it at you or behind you and turn the screen to see it. You can tap on the screen to focus or adjust properties easily.-Facial auto focus works really great! I know there is an upgraded camera (80D) that makes this better. But honestly if you are looking to save some money just get this camera. You're gonna be happy with the autofocus. It's fine.-Compared to my bigger cameras this guy is really light weight-The menus are easy to navigate-the footage looks amazing-Shoots 24p-Sound is straightforward. You need an off camera mic and you preferably want a powered mic so you can use the mic gain and not the camera's gain to get less hiss.-Can use any EF or EF-S lens.So you you are a canon shooter you've got a head start-Takes pretty nice photos too! Since I didn't buy this for photos admittedly I haven't delved in. I would truthfully use my 5D Mark IV for a photo shoot. But for me when I am out there shooting video if I want to snap a few stills this guy works great.Cons:-Not 4k (this is not a con for me but if you want 4k look elsewhere)-Not a high quality/high bit-depth format. (Again this is not a huge deal for me. I'm about story and speed over noodling with quality. I also own a BMPCC and yes shooting raw 10 or 12 bit is amazing... but you have to CC everything do online/offline workflows etc. so this is really more of a preference than a con. You have to know what you want to do. I think this camera wins for vlogging-Not as great with low light as other cameras.  This camera caps off at ISO 6400. But realistically you wanna be at 800 1600 max if you are good with seeing some noise.  On my Mark IV I can shoot at 6400 and see no visible noise. But I mean the Mark IV is like thousands of dollars more so it's not a great comparison.-Its not full frame. Not a huge problem neither was the Alexa I've shot TV shows on for years. But if you want full frame this ain't it. So you need wider aperture lenses or to shoot really long lens if you want to get shallow depth of field.LENSES:On lenses I did pick it up with the 18-55mm kit lens then also bought the little 2.8 24mm pancake lens.  They're both great lenses actually... for the cost.  The 18-55 has stabilization so is better for hand held stuff but needs more light. The 24mm makes the camera super light to carry and also looks nice at 2.8.  Both of these lenses autofocus great with the camera.So I disagree with some reviews out there that say don't get the kit lens. These days canon makes them pretty good and they are cheap in comparison to other lenses. So unless you have all the glass you need - get the kit lens.  I usually get the short zoom kit lens because they are sharper and faster.Having used this camera for a few weeks I really want to get something wider like the canon 10-22 or the sigma equivalent. I think there are times when being at a 10 to 14mm especially out doors would be helpful.  I have not used either of these two lenses my widest lens that is not a fisheye is the canon 15mm zoom.CONCLUSION:This camera may be on the older side right now but I have to tell you I like it better for videography than my Mark IV. it's just so much faster and easier to use and doesn't make you're wrist feel like it is going to break off. And because it is older you can get it cheaper.Don't let all the posts and videos about technical quality hold you back from just going out there and creating. At the end of the day it's about your talent and your stories. Tell them. I've seen big TV shows with Alexa's suck. I've seem people do amazing things with iPhones. It's not the cameras its you and how you use them.So if you're gonna go tell stories and you have about $1200 bucks to do so get this camera the kit lens and an on camera mic. That's all you need. I promise you.,0

January 26  2016By Jones Family,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am in Love with this Camera!!! I was given this Canon camera as a Christmas gift from my husband.  I have never had a SLR camera before.  My camera that I was using was a digital that I first got when digital was the new thing.  So this was quite the upgrade for me!!!  I was very intimidated at first not knowing if I would be able to use it or not. I can honestly say that if you know how to read instructions then just reading the instruction manual can really get you up and going.  Just off of reading the instruction manual I was able to learn how to make the camera basically a point and shoot camera along with also being able to figure out how to start to use some special effects with the camera still auto focusing itself.The camera also takes videos and this was very simple to figure out how to do.  It has lots of different modes and tons of options if you are camera savvy and know what you are doing to make some quality photos.  When my husband wanted to get me a camera for Christmas he did tons of research.  He is a computer guy so research is really his thing.  He found this to be the best option out there for someone who is new to learning an SLR along with being one of the most sought after cameras from those who are well experienced with SLR cameras.  So whether you are new to SLR or a pro the photos I have seem come out of this camera are amazing.  I will attach just a few of the photos this newbie took in my first week of learning this camera.It is a very pricey camera at $1200 but if you can swing the cost it is well worth it and I would highly recommend this camera!!!!!,1

Well that's true but the audio is filled with the infamous audio background hiss.  The shotgun mic it comes with doesn't have a setting to limit sound input to +20 or +40 dB.  So basically the mic is not much better than the built-in camera mic.The picture quality is very high-quality as is the video quality.  The audio is a deal-breaker though.  You NEED an external mic with adjustable dB.,0

Anderson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have a love hate relationship with this camera. I've been shooting with it for about 5 months now and it has the ability to take amazing photographs. Previously I had been shooting with a lower end Rebel that my brother gave me and I upgraded to this because the Rebel was limiting me creatively and technically. Specifically I wanted more auto focus points to allow me to compose the images in ways which the Rebel's 9 point focus system wouldn't allow. I mainly use a 50mm 1.8 II the 70-200 2.8 L  and a 100mm Macro 2.8 L IS. Sometimes the 85mm 1.8 USM. The biggest downfall of this camera in my experience is that it has a severe consistency issue with it's auto focus. I take photos which based upon the lighting conditions and the settings should produce sharp photos. Sometimes they are absolutely tack sharp and amazing. And the other half of the time it is (usually) front focusing. If it was consistent one way or another I could make micro adjustments but since it is so inconsistent if I micro adjust it will just have the same problem on the other half of the photos. It happens wide open and even on higher apertures and It makes me very frustrated!! It ends up wasting my time due to the volume of photos I have to take and sort through to pick out the usable images.If I were able to go back in time I would have just spent the extra money and went for the 5D Mark III which is what I wish I had right now.I love the layout the build and build quality and all the functionality of the 70 D except for this auto focus consistency issue. It make me miss the perfect facial expressions that flicker just once and are just enough out of focus when I pull it up in lightroom to render the photo useless. I end up having to take many more photos than I normally would just so I can be sure I have some in focus for my clients.At first I chalked it up to my inexperience as a semi-pro photographer but I'm confident now as others have had this same issue that it is a problem with the system not me. Perhaps its only some of the camera bodies and I was one of the unlucky ones but it's very frustrating.I will attach some photos that show my love of this camera though because when it nails it it really nails it! It can produce some amazing simply stunning photos. (most of these were taken with my 50mm 1.8 II STM),1

While I do use the photo functionality of the 70D every once in a while I use these primarily for video so that's what my review will be focused on.I've shot with a Canon 70D for a little over a year now. About 6 months after buying my first 70D I bought a second one. My 70Ds have essentially replaced my two previous cameras each from the lower-level Canon Rebel line (a T2i and a T3i). When switching over from a Rebel to the 70D I noticed an immediate difference in picture quality. While the 70D and Rebels shoot at the same resolution the 70D offers a number of different codecs to shoot in which can greatly affect your video quality.The biggest advantage of the 70D over the Rebels is the autofocus. I'd owned the T2i and T3i for the better part of 5 years before switching to the 70D and had never used autofocus while recording on the Rebels (it was atrocious). I was used to focusing by hand which is fine and dandy for most shots (usually when locked down on a tripod) but can make others (handheld slider dolly) incredibly difficult to maintain focus. The 70D changed that. I started using the autofocus on a couple L lenses whenever I was shooting which helped guarantee I'd never end up with a shot out of focus. This was especially helpful when shooting on a jib since I couldn't keep my hands around the focus ring when the camera is kept 8 feet away. Being able to trust the tracking/autofocus has made my life a lot easier as a camera operator. Whenever I'm using a lens without AF (like a cine lens) I really do find myself missing the autofocus of the other lenses.I don't plan on upgrading from a 70D to a 5D IV anytime soon for two reasons - first obviously the 5D IV is far more expensive than the 70D (it currently costs about 250% more than the 70D) but the bigger reason that I'm not planning on upgrading is the fact that the 70D (as well as any Rebel post-T3i) has an articulating screen and the 5D IV does not. I use the screen on the 70D too much to settle for one that's permanently inset into the back of my camera. And while yes an external HDMI monitor can essentially fix this I do enough run-and-gun shooting that I don't often want to deal with bringing along a monitor setting it up keeping its batteries charged etc. Yet I do need to be able to see my shot even when my camera's backed up against a wall or set up high enough to shoot over a crowd which is when the articulating screen really comes in handy.,0

DSLR Cameras,B00I6TC6XG,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        2 211 of 2 297 people found the following review helpful       Amazing camera -  D800 replacement?  May 8  2012By Waikiki,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Like many folks I pre-ordered the D800 the same day it was available.  Alas Nikon totally blew the market analysis vs production vs. supply chain formula.  After waiting 2 months I had to leave the country before Nikon got it's D800 act together. I needed a beat-up D90 replacement camera and the D3200 seemed like a decent place-holder.  I quickly ordered one before they were back-ordered too!  Sure the D3200 is DX not FX.  Sure it is not nearly as flexible.  Sure it can only AF with newer lenses.  BUT you can buy about 4-D3200's for the price of a D800 AND it comes with a decent kit lens for $699!The tutoring graphical-based menu system is geared more to beginners which I am not so I find it maddening.  Most will love it since it is somewhat educational and offers a great variety of pre-sets to take creative shots easily.It is amazingly light weight - lighter than most lenses! It is very quiet. The AF could be faster but it's plenty fast enough. When you dig deeper you shockingly find that the D3200 has many advanced internal features from the highest-end cameras (D800 & F4). The high-res LCD rear screen the EXPEED 3 image processing engine and a new 24MP sensor.  The EXPEED 3 image processing engine allows the D3200 to perform at an altitude unheard of for a so-called entry level camera.  Nikon's Active-D dynamic range enhancement at 24MP at 4 frames per second requires substantial in-camera processing power.I bought this camera primarily for still photography. With the proper lenses & technique the results are stunning.  Low-light/high ISO performance is far beyond what you should expect at this level camera. Candle-lit face images are noise-free and look great. Still life's on a tripod at ISO 100 have more resolution that ANY DSLR I have ever used with very little shadow noise.  In short I might not accept my D800 when it becomes available.  I might use the D3200 longer than I thought (waiting for the 24MP FX D600 for $1999 later this year -- my guesses on price & stats & date)...or just keep using the D3200.  If it breaks (I'm hard on cameras) I'll just buy a new one.Bottom line -- the D3200: super light-weight very quiet super high resolution (& low noise high dynamic range superb colors) incredible HD video with slow motion.  It is no doubt THE most amazing DSLR value on the planet!5/14/12 UPDATE: I've now shot 100s of images using lenses from 11 mm to 600 mm.  I've learned a lot.  Super-high resolution cameras are a new arena for most of us. On the surface one automatically thinks you will get images with twice the resolution (12MP vs 24MP). Not so.  MP resolution is measured linearly so the increase while significant is less than doubled.  More importantly when you enter the hi-res camera stratosphere photographic technique & lens choice are critical. While these high MP cameras are capable of amazing results you have to work to get absolutely ALL the MP's this camera has to offer.  Do not blame the camera if your initial results are less dramatically sharper than your old 6-8-12MP Nikon. It's probably you...BTW the Nikon 18-55mm is a decent lens but it doesn't do this imager justice.  You can get better results with better glass.  The excellent f1.8 35mm DX Nikon on this camera makes a super-light weight compact package you can carry all day long producing super images.  A 60 year-old Nikkor Q 200mm f4 $70 or so on eBay produces stunning results if carefully used on Manual on a tripod.Set-up a table with clean background and a few artifacts on it.  Use the sharpest lens you have  at f 8 on a sturdy tripod perpendicular to the table Shoot the scene with the in-camera flash on both old & new camera bodies. You will see the difference easily when images from both cameras are compared side by side enlarged to 100%.How does this translate to everyday casual shooting?  Not easily. Sub-par technique still results in sub-par images no matter what camera is used.  If you are a beginner looking for the best entry-level DSLR ever made all of this won't matter -- grab a D3200 and shoot away!  Just note that the D3200 is capable of world-class imagery.  If it takes more effort to take photographs of this caliber it's a good thing -- the D3200 forces you to up your game to get there!5/5/13 UPDATE.  It's been a year.  I have a D800 and a D3200.  Yes there are many differences between the two.  One is at the high end of the spectrum the other entry level.  When I'm shooting commercially or seriously in any way it's the D800.  It is a superb camera if you own glass that can fully exploit the 36MP sensor and your technique is solid. For everything else I use the D3200.  Why?  It's light and compact.  You can easily carry it around all day with the f1.8 35mm and hardly know it's there.  If that lens isn't wide enough shoot a 3-frame series and stitch them together in Photoshop.  Again with good glass and technique the results are very very good.  D800 territory? No but few would notice. The D3200 is a pleasure to use and handles fast enough for most kinds of photography. You can use old manual Nikkor lenses easily albeit with a bit more effort.  With the focus confirmation dot in the viewfinder manual focusing is easy.  Exposure can be guessed and adjusted using the great hi-res LCD.  I recently had to shoot an emergency-rush job covering a politician's speech. All I had in the car was the D3200 the 35mm f1.8 and an old sharp 100mm f2.8 E Nikkor  -- my normal in-car-at all-times stash.  The setting was indoors in a bright garden area -- no flash allowed.  I was surrounded by folks with Nikon D4's and $1500 lenses.  I got a few looks....LOL.  I boosted the ISO to 1600 used the $50 100mm @ f4 @1/125th and the results were great published in several places.  The D3200 is a great camera for the money I like it more now than when I first bought it!,0

April 14  2015By Ruben D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,La la llaaovveee this camera!! Just to start this review  I'm super ocd with my purchases. Definitely more lenient with purchases worth less I'll admit  but not for a piece worth almost 400$. I reaseched on different websites and even visited a few stores for the best deal. Long story short this was it after about a week or two or hunting the best deal . It does not get better than this folks. The camera came brand spanking new. It came with original accessories like neck strap battery cap for camera Lense cap and battery charger also a Manuel and cd for the camera oh and cords for the camera. Of course the camera also came with a brand new Lense too AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. Yeah this Lense alone is worth 250. Also the standard Lense for the d3200 is the AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR not VR II.. So think this was a added bonus for buying the refurbished item and having faith in nikon. I'm transitioning from a SLR a FE2 to be exact. I love the functionality and all the capabilities of  this camera thus far. The resolution on the screen really helps make bold adjustments too. This is the perfect camera for the aspiring beginner photographer.  I'll post pics hopes this helps anyone trying to make a decision. Please like if it has thanks,1

If you are new and want a nice inexpensive DSLR but are drowning/hesitating among all the options and prices don't. Just buy this you will not regret it. I picked up this refurb kit a month ago for $365 and I did a double take because I couldn't believe everything I was getting. I personally shoot with my trusty old D90 still but this was for a specific project that needed a dedicated camera. I have to admit that this shoots way more reliably than my D90. It's focus is incredibly fast and the metering is Nikon perfect. It's amazing what half a decade in technology leads to both in quality and in price.This D3200 bundle is the ideal camera for someone who is looking to step up from point-and-shoot cameras and phone snapshots and get started with digital photography. It is pretty full-featured and has amazing picture quality for a fraction of the cost of the more expensive models. Basically this is a way to get into the hobby or dramatically improve the quality of your pictures without breaking the bank. I couldn't even tell that it was refurbished. It looked brand new to me. Not a scratch or a nick anywhere and the LCD was bright and crystal clear. With this you can produce stunning photos (and videos) without being reduced to tears if you drop it on accident or be too afraid to hand it to a friend/relative to take a picture for you. As is often said having the best (read: most expensive) camera in the world is useless if you're too afraid to take it outside and take pictures.The lens on this is a perfect first lens. It's 18-55mm which means it's a zoom lens (you spin a ring on the lens to select the region you are capturing zooming in one way and zooming out the other). It's sharp fast and handles low light decently. I'd of course recommend the spectacular fixed 35mm for its tack sharpness and to shine in low-light as well as the 55-200mm to give you some telephoto (serious distance zoom) coverage but these lenses each cost half the price of this camera kit! You can see how photography can become a very expensive hobby very quickly. I'd hold off on those as a first purchase and wait to see how things go.But this is why this kit in particular is a great starter package. You get an entry level but still very solid camera body and a decent zoom lens. Don't let the term ""entry level"" make you feel cheap this is still a Nikon camera with a legitimate Nikkor lens. It is categorically different and more capable than any point and shoot or pinhole phone camera. Period. End of discussion. If you find that you want/need more Nikon will be more than happy to sell you more lenses or step up to a more expensive camera body later. For the first step though this is ideal.I should note that in addition to taking ridiculously high quality photos this also does quite well with video. It can do 1080p video at up to 30 fps or 720p at 60 fps. I'd have loved to have seen 1080p at 60fps but you don't get that unless you go to the D3300 or D5300 which cost tons more than this D3200 kit. That's just not worth the extra cost.In practice I've been amazed. Even under terrible lighting conditions (e.g. indoor low light under coiled fluorescent lights with completely mismatched color temperatures and an LCD as an intended capture target) I can get remarkable photo and video quality with perfect color reproduction. Nikon's white balance settings do sheer magic where even a prosumer camcorder just fails miserably (I'm looking at you Sony). Sure some of the knobs and dials are tucked away in menus and not as easily accessible as on the more pro-level cameras but for the price I'll deal with fiddling with the menus on the few times that I need them (honestly my D90 was overwhelming for months when I first got it). For the vast majority of the time I just set it to program or manual mode and fire away. It's beautiful.",0

DSLR Cameras,B00I6TC6XG,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        10 of 10 people found the following review helpful       Best DSLR for the money.  May 10  2014By Peter Haight,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Although I know my review will fall between the other high-rated ones eventually I thought i'd share my positive experiences with this camera.PROS:-Price. $500 is cheap in comparison to other similar (albeit lower quality) cameras like the Canon Rebel T3i 60D or even the newer T5i.-Build Quality. This camera is built in Thailand to the extent of my knowledge but the quality control on mine is absolutely incredible. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Has nice grips and a comfortable weight to it. Not an overly bulky camera either.-Image quality/sensor. At $500 you get a true 24.2 megapixel DSLR camera. SnapSort in their comparison of the D3200 vs its direct competitor the Canon Rebel T3i 18 megapixel DSLR stated that the image quality on the D3200 is over 20% better as attributed to the D3200's 10% larger image sensor and higher true megapixel count which accounts for 30% more detail in photos. The image sensor is very high quality and this camera consistently takes incredible pictures. I'm not a professional photography by any means this is simply a great hobby of mine but I am a perfectionist about pictures. The ability to easily take awesome pictures with this camera is second to none.-Ease of use. I am an amateur photographer who was looking for a nice upgrade and I made sure to do my homework when it came to selecting a camera. I ended up on this camera because of what everybody else said it's ease of use was a major selling factor in the purchase. I've had this camera for a few weeks and I still haven't even figured out everything it's capable of-- there's quite a bit! But the guide mode helps you with some basic and advanced photography.-Nice lens kit. Out of the box I'll admit the 18-55mm is quite limited in what it can do especially as somebody who enjoys macrophotography but it'll be able to do most of the shots you'd like to take. The VR feature is nice as well.-Nikon brand quality. As always Nikon has delivered a high quality product. I've owned a few Nikon products before and they've never failed me. I prefer Nikons to Canons in the world of DSLRs anyway.-Ability to save as JPG/Raw.-Out of the box: comes with body lens strap battery and charger etc.CONS:-I can't really seem to think of any that aren't dumb little nitpicks.Final thoughts: This camera is perfect for the beginner and good enough for the master. It does it all!,0

It works great for the beginner and is capable of growing with you as you gain confidence with photography and with the camera itself.  When this first arrived I was overwhelmed by all of the buttons.  I never thought I would learn them.  After reviewing the included literature once I feel reasonably confident on playing with some manual settings.  It takes phenomenal pictures in auto ""point-and-shoot"" mode and has several auto/manual modes that seemed to be designed to take you from ""what is a DSLR?"" to ""I think a lower F-stop would really bring out her eyes.""  The pictures in fully automated mode are vivid crisp and well-exposed for just about any subject in nearly any lighting condition.  My cellphone camera takes pictures that make me look like a manic gorilla but this camera makes me look like a professional.",1

September 5  2014By MJH-64 Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After being a professional wedding photographer for over 23 years. (retired now)  Using a heavy 35 mm manual camera and miles of film.... This Nikon D3200 was my first choice for a digital SLR updated camera.  Being fairly  new to ""digital"" SLR. I caught on to the instructions  pretty fast since it's almost the same as it used to be on my old camera.  The concept and rules of photography didn't change....  I found that using this camera was pretty easy after going through the instruction book plus trial and error just taking photos with the camera.  This camera has all the features that I would use.... even has a photo editor in the menu... color enhancer crop red eye corrector  change photo to black and white even has a star filter add in... warming or cooling effect  lots of added stuff.. I used to do in the darkroom with color prints manually.This camera comes with a lens 18 to 55 mm witch to me is a great small zoom lens but it  wouldn't be my prime lens.  I would use a straight  35 mm for all around use can use the lens in much lower light without a flash  and the 18 to 55 mm for other things like family gatherings where you don't have to step around to get your shot  just zoom in or out to make the frame fit the subject being photographed.The camera has a pop up flash witch is real handy and easy to use good for about ten to twelve feet.  Notice the flash is slightly higher then the lens.  You are more then likely going to get red eye pretty easy if the subject looks at the camera lens while being photographed ... The fix is having a TTL. external dedicated  flash on the hot shoe that bounces off the ceiling ....much better results.My research  home work paid off  I believe ..... I was looking at the D3300  newer camera model  and the specs. didn't change much but the price went up for the newer model... so I saved about sixty bucks buying the older model camera.  The D3200 started new add on's after the D3100  like one I noticed  would be the wireless controller remote shutter  ML-L3Buying the VR lens was worth the extra money.  They do sell this without the VR lens.... for less $.  You need V R on your lens  when you use any kind of zoom lens..... Keeps the vibration down for less blurring on slower shutter speeds or fast moving objects.  VR = Vibration ReducerOverall This Nikon D3200 was my First choice for an all around SLR camera.....  Once you get your SLR camera in your hands your pretty much will be commented to it.  Then it starts to be a collection of ""products to fit""  and add on to the camera.  Since you can do so much more being creative photography with this camera over a point and shoot camera.  I gave this 5 Stars.",0
DSLR Cameras,B00I6TC6XG,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Dollar for dollar it's hard to beat  December 29  2015By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Probably the best starter DSLR on the market of any brand as of December 2015. Yes there is a newer model (the d3300) available but if you can save $100 I'd still get this one. The new model is unnoticeablely lighter allows you to shoot 1 fps faster if needed and gives you the ability to create panoramics in-camera (plenty of free software is out there for that already) and the ISO goes up even higher (although the image quality is terrible at those high ISO's on both models). Is that all really worth the price increase for an entry level crop-sensor dslr... most likely not.Features: You get all the basic features you need. They don't overload this model with tons of features most people will never use. The omission of all the fancy little used features unless you're into a specific style of photography creates a learning curve for this camera that is fairly easy especially if you have any background using camera controls.Side note: This camera requires AF-S lenses to autofocus since it does not have a built in-camera focus motor. Not a huge issue (both lenses that come with it are AF-S) just something to be aware of. The biggest complaint I read on lens reviews is certain lenses being only manual focus with this camera. That's because they bought an AF lens when they needed an AF-S lens and really no fault of either product.Build: Very quality build both in materials and design. It's not weather sealed but I wouldn't take my weather sealed full frame cameras out in the rain either if I didn't have to so this doesn't affect me much.Image/Video quality: Plainly put both are wonderful. Full HD video with the push of a button is great and still something a few pro Nikon's still don't do (I'm looking at you D7--).  The picture quality is wonderful in shooting conditions with adequate light. To be fair any lighting issues with this camera tend to fall more on the lenses than the camera itself. 24.2MP is way more than you need to produce quality images. Megapixel count is more of a marketing gimmick nowadays unless you're blowing up photos to cover an entire wall in a house.Lenses included: These are Nikon's plasticy kit lenses. Months/years from now if you move into full-frame phtography both these lenses will work on your new camera just not well... but that's a big ""if"" you decide to buy that level of camera. With that being said they are extremely sharp lenses that will cover an adequate range for most of your shooting. Don't forget crop sensors (like this camera and most other budget dslr's have) actually magnify the lens coverage (and not degrade the picture quality) so the 200mm lens you get will work more like a 300mm lens. that's plenty of zooms for what most people need. Both lenses included should treat you well.A big bonus this camera accepts all the pre-AI prime lenses Nikon made some being 50 years old now! These are some phenomenal lenses you can buy on most auction sites for very cheap.Overall: It easily earns five stars. Ease of use and image quality are all top notch. Owning Nikon's nicest DSLR's for my photography business (I currently own D4's D810's and a D610) I purchased one to test out and ended up using it for personal use for about half a year loving every second of it. Would I recommend this to a professional? No. Would I recommend this to any of my friends looking for a great dslr without spending thousands of dollars? Yes... and it would be my first choice.Just shooting the family? Are you a student looking to take a photography class? This might be your best choice.WARNING: VERIFY THE MODEL YOU ARE BUYING IS A USA VERSION. Easiest way to confirm: 99% of these have a serial number (on the bottom of the camera) starting with a 3. Import (aka Grey Market) Nikon's are often bought MUCH cheaper buy non-legit sellers and then sold again to you. If they are the import model you should be paying a LOT less. And keep in mind Nikon's warranties do not apply to ANY import model. In fact their service centers WILL NOT TOUCH OR FIX an import model no matter where or when you bought it... they will just mail it back to you at your expense. If it breaks or has any issue you have no other option than to buy a new camera.",0

I have one.HOWEVER...beware that this bundle comes with a lens that is non-VR.VR stands for Vibration Resistance.Unless you plan on taking still shots with a tripod and remote then the lens will prove itself useless to you.To hand hold a camera with a non-VR lens produces images that look out of focusThat's because it is impossible to hold a camera without your hand having some degree of shaking/movement.I recommend spending the extra for a VR lens.In my opinion I think that manufacturers should make it clear to consumers that non VR lenses have limited functionality.I have known a few beginners who have put money into their cameras/lenses not knowing the significance ofthis and so disappointed that their photos aren't crisp and focused.,0
DSLR Cameras,B00I6TC6XG,Nikon D3200 24.2 MP CMOS Digital SLR…,        48 of 53 people found the following review helpful       and had a much better idea of what she was doing  November 24  2014By ZDuBois,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I gave this camera to my girlfriend as an anniversary gift.  I've never owned a DSLR camera before - heck my only camera for the past decade has been a cell phone.  She had dabbled in SLR film photography prior to this though and had a much better idea of what she was doing.My first impression of this camera was more or less ""wow... I can actually take pictures in low light without a flash.""  The ability to actually capture what one sees naturally is a pretty huge deal.  This may seem pretty stupid to more experienced photographers but it was a brave new world to me.The instructions which come with the camera are very clear and seem definitely written for someone who has never played with a ""real"" camera before.  There is not only a good explanation of the mechanical features of the camera (ie which buttons do what) but also contain a decent crash course on manual photography.  They explain the basics -  aperture shutter speed ISO and how each of the different settings configure these settings to produce a different quality of image.  Starting with zero background information I was able to develop a decent intuition based on these descriptions and some trial and error (ie - just taking a lot of pictures).  Coming from a film background my girlfriend had the same reaction - ""It's nice to just be able to practice with the camera get instant feedback and not have to worry about film.""One of the complaints I've seen about this camera compared to the slightly more expensive models is that the single thumb wheel is limiting and slows down the photography workflow.  I sort of disagree - at least for a beginner.  First of all the camera has a number of well placed modifier buttons - so if you set the camera to ""manual aperture"" mode the thumb wheel will control the aperture by default and use the magic of DSP to set the shutter speed exposure compensation and ISO.  However if you need to override one of those settings all you need to do is press the correct modifier button and the thumb wheel will then control the corresponding setting until the modifier button is released.  It works the same way in full manual mode except then it then turns off all the automatic compensation features as well.  I sort of like this mechanic as each partial-manual mode provides a single dimension of control (for simplicity) but still allows the user to easily and quickly override the other settings if necessary without turning the mode dial to a different position.  I think it is a great mechanic for beginners since it provides a clear and easy to understand distinction between the various shooting modes while still providing quick access to the rest of the settings.  In that sense I don't see it as a limitation as much as I see it as a somewhat simpler way to learn the camera while also learning the finer points of photography.  However if you are already an expert and understand the ins and outs of the Nikon hardware and software then I could see it being a bit frustrating.  I haven't had to play around inside the menus to control basic settings at all though as some have suggested in other reviews.In terms of build quality what more can I say which has not already been covered?  You definitely are not sacrificing mechanical or ergonomic quality when buying this camera over some of the more expensive ones.  It feels solid but light in the hand.  All the buttons have a nice firm satisfying snappiness to them with no softness or ambiguity and they are all placed in a way which makes sense.  The action on the lenses feels like butter and even though they are plastic - they feel sturdy and high quality.  From what I understand one's ability to shoot at low shutter speeds and small aperture is directly related to one's ability to balance and control the weight of the entire kit so the attention to weight reduction which Nikon has put into this body and the lenses should directly translate to better pictures.  Even the Nikon branded bag which comes with the bundle demonstrates an incredible attention to detail as the interior is completely modular through clever use of velcro dividers which allows the user to easily move and re-size the various compartments.The photographs themselves are stunning.  It's really difficult to put the experience into words.  Just the ability to reliably capture and record what one sees opens a whole world of possibilities in terms of shooting.  It is liberating in a way.  Even if your goal is not to have your photographs published in National Geographic and you just want to document your vacation for posterity being able to do so simply and reliably makes casual photography much more enjoyable.In conclusion - this is a great camera for a beginner and has a ton of room to grow with the user.  Sure there are better sensors out there and more feature-rich cameras but for someone who's primary interest is to learn the basics take fantastic pictures and develop the hobby beyond what is possible with a point-and-shoot camera it really seems like this would be difficult to beat in terms of price quality and performance.",0
DSLR Cameras,B01GHVIU70,Pentax K-70 Weather-Sealed DSLR…,        102 of 102 people found the following review helpful       The Pentax K70 is very close to my ideal camera  August 8  2016By Moreno Tagliapietra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Hello I have been a photographer for 50+ years working with a lot of different subjects and gear on and off as a part-time pro. Today I mostly shoot landscapes cityscapes flowers birds (a little) and do fine art studies and some tabletop in my home little studio. I make my own prints with a 17"" inkjet photo printer. I mainly work in Raw + jpeg Av mode the lowest possible ISO setting +- 1f/stop bracketing AF-S. When shooting dynamic subjects (i.e.: birds) I use the TAv mode max ISO3200. I prefer framing with the pentaprism but use the articulated LCD monitor for high/low angle shooting. I don't do video with my cameras. The K70 is my 4th Pentax APS-C model. I received it a week ago and tested it with the following personal conclusions.Summary of the Pentax K70 key features: a very compact (for its class) and solid weatherized body with external controls for all common camera settings; a new 24Mp (Sony?) sensor with phase detection AF; 1/6000sec max shutter speed; max ISO102400; 14bit color depth; class leading pentaprism; fully articulated LCD monitor; state of the art in-camera IS; a feature set way above its price with some unique capabilities (such as pixel shift high res).Body: The K70 is a small camera that is a pleasure to hold. It fits well in my medium-size male hands and feels reassuringly solid. The outside controls are well placed and let me quickly access all my major camera settings (aperture compensation ISO drive and test pic). Weatherization is a must for me since I like to shoot in all weather conditions. To the best of my knowledge the body is polycarbonate on a metal chassis but Pentax and weatherization ensure that it is built with good materials and tight tolerances.Viewing: The large pentaprism is of superior quality. Up to certain distance I can see the subject coming into focus. The LCD monitor is bright and clear and its full articulation let me work even when my eye cannot reach the pentaprism (I often shoot plants and some landscapes close to the ground). I like that I am able to close it against the body when not using it.Sensor: 24Mp is more than enough for me (I get excellent 24x36"" prints out of my 16Mp Olympus M43 OMD cameras). The high res pixel shift mode does enhance resolution and color accuracy and reduces noise. I used it in my studio and with outdoor semi-static subjects where I could combine it with a single shot to replace moving parts showing artifacts. Its new Motion Correction function saves processing time with some dynamic subjects. Since I shoot Raw and process in the Photoshop's 16bit Pro Photo color space the camera 14bit color depth is very appreciated. Saving Raw in the dng format simplifies storage.Exposure: I find it to be quite reliable in most conditions (and exposure bracketing takes care of most of the exceptions). While I like to set it myself by consulting the histogram (test pic) and applying the corrections I want when there is no time for fussing around it's good to be able to trust the camera. The K70 max shutter speed is a fast 1/6000sec typical of more expensive cameras. There are Auto PASM Sv (Sensitivity/ISO priority) TAv (Shutter and Aperture priority) HDR and other 13 custom modes and 9 digital filters too. The Interval Timer Multiple Exposure and especially (for me) Interval Composite (bright) modes are particularly interesting and deserve further exploration (google them). Int Comp Bright shoots a number of pics and combines them into one using the brightest pixels available (fireworks anyone?).AF: New to Pentax the K70 has on-chip phase-detect autofocus pixels for a hybrid AF system that should speed up AF in Live View and video. In its review of the camera photographyblog states that AF in LV is now significantly faster. AF-S my main mode is very fast and accurate. I am not a good judge of AF-C and tracking because my action photography is limited. I have fun and good success shooting shore birds and the guests at my feeders in AF-S and AF-C (depending on the action). Nevertheless I would like to point out that the effectiveness of a camera AF also depends on technique. Like many pros I always use center spot focusing and recomposing. The center AF sensor is the most sensitive and I always know exactly where my focus plane is. In dark conditions I focus on an area on the plane of the subject that has contrast and/or detail and recompose. I can do this very quickly. With moving subjects being able to anticipate the action helps a lot. For example an osprey carrying fish or sticks for a new nest tends to approach (at least for a while) from the same direction and hover above the nest for a couple of seconds. One can get some great pics by being aware of this positioning him/herself for the proper angle and light direction and pre-focusing (the camera 6 fps continuous shooting is respectable). Also to be remembered is that IS compensates for camera shake but not for subject motion for which one has to use the proper shutter speed. For all these reasons the K70 ""only"" 11 focusing points are not an issue to me. When working in the studio in Live View the ability to move the spot focus point around is great. I often use focus bracketing (and stacking in Photoshop). The combination of a good macro lens high res and focus staking gives amazing results approaching higher pixel count FF cameras levels (remember that IS has to be off when working on a tripod). BTW the new cable release is very welcome together with the AC adapter.IS: The in-camera 4.5f/stop image stabilization is top of the line and also allows for pixel shift high res and AA filter simulation. Together with the camera low noise at high ISO it lets me work without a tripod in most conditions something that with age I have come to love.My default button and dial settings: mode dial: ""Av"" (TAv if action); front dial: ""F/stop""; rear dial: ""ISO""; Fx1: ""test pic""; Fx2: ""choose spot AF point"" in LV; AF AE-L: ""lock exposure"".Conclusion: In action I find the K70 to be very comfortable and fun to use. It is highly competent (it does a lot of things quickly and with no fuss) with a combination of IQ construction quality ergonomics feature set and price that comes very close to my ideal camera. It is not tiresome to work with I can see what I'm doing very well quickly change major settings shoot from any position and not worry if the weather gets dusty wet or cold. The boundary between advanced amateur and pro cameras is quite fuzzy. For my kind of photography the K70 is easily capable of pro level performance. An all metal pro shutter K3II would last longer but so far I have never had a camera that gave up on me because of old age. Also for serious work one typically travels with 2 bodies (for redundancy and to minimize lens changing in tough conditions) which in the case of the K70 would cost a reasonable $1300 (probably $1200 by the end of the year). The rest of one's budget can be wisely used to buy great lenses of which there is no shortage.08/12/16 addendumA final note that could be helpful to some. I love to shoot in horrible (wonderful) weather including rain wind snow ice and sub-zero temps often doing some slippery scrambling to get into position. For max portability in these conditions I use Oly EM10II and EM5II cameras with slower minuscule but good quality Oly and Pana lenses. In my experience the K70 is overall superior to the EM10II (excluding size) at a comparable price at least because of its weatherization pixel shift technology and pixel count. The EM5II is my top camera which surpasses the K70 in some important areas such as size the large and clear EVF AF IS more external controls continuous shooting and some really usable creative stuff like Live Composite. Alas it is also about $450 more expensive (= a good lens). Working with all 3 cameras is very satisfying but I noticed something curious. While the small size of the Oly's is very convenient I prefer the way the Pentax sits in my hands and I can operate it. It feels like the perfect fit. Moral: always try a new camera in your own hands before buying.08/13/16 addendum: a note about pixel shift high resolution (PSHR)PSHR is offered by recent Pentax and Olympus camera models. It has been received with various degrees of favor because it's limited to still subjects (not true). In real life it produces levels of detail color accuracy lower noise and expanded DR comparable to top of the line FF cameras when used with still studio subjects and outdoor subjects with limited movement. The latter is done either by using the new Pentax K1 and K70 Motion Correction feature and/or stacking and masking a normal res frame to replace high res parts in motion showing artifacts. I have tried it with both my Olympus E-M5 mark II and the Pentax K70 with similar IQ results. The Oly can output a 40Mp jpeg and a 64Mp ORF Raw with limitations about f/stop and max ISO. The Pentax can output a 24Mp PEF/DNG Raw and a jpeg with no exposure limitations. When everything is said and done I do not care about the jpeg outputs and prefer the practicality of the Pentax 24Mp Raw which saved in dng can be opened directly by any Raw converter and has a more than high enough pixel count. Next month Olympus should unveil its E-M1 mark II with even more advanced PSHR features.08/31/16 addendumAdded pic # 7 a visual comparison of the Pentax K70 with a basic bright lens set vs the Oly em5 II with equivalent good IQ but darker lenses for max portability.02/22/17 addendumStill my favorite camera and the price is down to $600. I am adding photo #8 of the sunset in one of town's parks. This was a test of in-camera HDR set to HDR3 +-3 f/stops max jpeg size and quality all jpeg settings at their minimum or OFF and a little fine tuning in PS.

Realized I was stepping down from flag ship series to high end enthusiast camera.  But I was looking to using some new features save money and keep the K-5 for backup.On arrival I immediately upgraded Firmware to 1.10.  At first glance the image quality seems similar to the K-5 but I haven't gotten around to looking closely at images in comparison.  Also I look forward to trying the new features.Likes:* Looks like it will work fine in place of my old K-5 for all my normal shooting.* The articulating back display* larger ISO range* more settings are saved in user settings (compared to k-5 which had some big limitations - such as could not be used with interval shooting)* fast charge - from depleted to mostly charged in an hourMiss:* larger battery capacity of K-5 (bought two Wasabi batteries since I have had good look with them in the past).  Also ordering AC power supply for use in remote shooting* focus confirmation in viewfinder when doing manual focusDislike:* WI-FI - when it works it's nice but limited.  The remote control is very flaky.  Have used the remote ""Image Sync"" app with both iPhone and Android tablet with similar results.  It will hang at times.  And sometimes after a long delay will report that it has lost communication with camera.  Sometimes killing the ""Image Sync"" app and restarting it will start it working again.  Other times need to switch the camera off and on again (not very convenient with remote shooting). It seems to work better for me if I switch off live view (save battery life) or use it for short intervals set raw+ (instead of raw) or JPEG and change focus to manual.  At least get fewer hangs with this setup and most of the time can recover by just killing the ""Image Sync"" app and restarting.  Hope that this will be improved over time with updates to camera firmware or fixes to mobile app but from past experience it may take a long time or may never happen.  Also the app is limited.  It only works in single shot mode and doesn't allow you to change shooting mode.  Might be nice to have bracketing support as well as video and interval shooting.Note:* Lightroom is not recognizing the PEF raw format but after switching to DNG it works.Will update this as I get more used to the camera.",0
DSLR Cameras,B01GHVIU70,Pentax K-70 Weather-Sealed DSLR…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       A worthy step up from the K-30  especially for video  November 7  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is mostly in comparison to my K-30 which died on me way too soon (but I really wanted an excuse to buy new camera anyway ;-) ) The 70 is a noticeable upgrade. For the price it is very hard to beat.What 70 has the 30 doesn't that I like:1) Wi-Fi - It only transfers to a phone app but it works and I like the idea I can take a high quality picture to post right away to social media instead of just using just my phone camera2) External mic input. My daughter acts and we do a lot of self taping for auditions and rehearsals. The 30's built in mic is tinny. The ability to add an external high quality mic makes the sound quality so much better and easier than mixing in a separate audio channel3) External HDMI out. Another thing that goes great with taping auditions because I can now just play back to a large monitor instead of using the small camera screen or having to remove the card and inserting in my computer4) Picture quality. As good as ever with even better color correctness. With the additional menu options of Clarity and Pixel Shifting you have even more options to experiment with5) Better video capabilities usability. Pentax has always given low priority to video and even though the 70 pays more attention to it other cameras are better if video is your main concern. Still shooting video on a DSLR with the ability to use various lenses is much better than using a separate single lens video camera. I am much happier with the improvements Pentax has made with their video capabilities including a better performing Live View function and better ability to adjust to different light levels. While they offer a continuous video auto focus function it only works with a couple of new lenses. I can live without it though6) Articulating screen. Not a huge benefit but I find myself using it more than I thought.I've had it a month and haven't used all the other additional features. Generally speaking it has everything the 30 did but with more variations and options. For example the HDR options are expanded with 2 more settings and the ability to adjust exposure and there are some additional options for setting the focal point that are interesting.Overall the controls and menu are very familiar and I have not found anything I do not like. Though one thing I really wish it had was an external headphone jack so I could hear the audio better. Another thing is at first it did not seem to focus very quickly but once I linked the exposure to the focal point (a settings option) it began focusing quickly.For those of you who own a 30 I can definitely say the 70 is a worthy step up especially if you want to shoot video.,0

Well when I came across the Pentax k-70 and what it offers at this price I couldn't help it but giving it 5 stars. I declined the kit lens due to the distortion issue and lack of Macro capabilities but treated myself to the 16-85mm. The camera offers excellent image quality with lots of details excellent dynamic range very low noise levels in all across ISOs and limitless tweeking options to help getting the best images possible. RAW images at DNG format are easy to use and gets the best out of this camera. Very few minor downfalls like any other camera at any price range but the quality of images is a treat especially when paired with a good lens such as the Pentax 16-85mm that is able to get the best out of a good sensor.,1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B014US3FQI,Ricoh Theta S Digital Camera (Black),        361 of 380 people found the following review helpful       Best VR camera for the price point and easy to use!  May 6  2016By Pauline,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am a virtual reality software engineer who has had experience with the HTC Vive Oculus Rift DK2 and new consumer version and various other devices.I have also used the M15 in the past. The form factor of both devices was great and I ultimately chose to buy the newer model due to the ability to make longer videos. In the M15 the resolution is too low and the contrast in picture quality is not great where colors appear undersaturated and flat.The S in contrast is definitely a notch above the m15. However this device is still prone to overexposure when taking 360 photos outside. The Theta S is a big improvement than its predecessor but in my opinion not enough to warrant purchasing an entirely new device if you have the older model.You get 25 minutes to record 1080 HD video as opposed to 6 minutes on the M15 but keep in mind that uploading it into Youtube truly skews the image quality so the videos do not truly feel like HD. However the Ricoh Theta software will auto stitch your video while exporting which minimizes the time spent editing saving the consumer many hours. The videos are not completely seamless and are subject to some fish-eye distortion.The S comes with live preview which uses the WiFi capabilities enabled in the camera itself. The shutter range is small and you must be close to the camera for reliable operation. While it is neat to have this capability the shoddy execution from the weak range leaves something to be desired.The S comes with a neoprene sleeve that fits snugly against the camera. However we decided to buy a hard case for added lens protection as Ricoh does not offer a warranty in the case that the lens themselves become damaged.The S controls are extremely easy to use and just the press of a button will take a 360 photo. However if you want the images to look as beautiful as they can a fair amount of post processing might still be required to get the dynamic range seen in reality.Overall I feel like this is the best VR camera you can get at this price point. The quality will not be able to rival a GoPro VR rig but the amount of effort required in post production is severely minimized by Ricoh Theta. With a GoPro rig you need to spend 2500 dollars and also buy or #D print a mount to house all of the camera together. It also requires that you sync the individual shutters and control the settings so that the VR immersion isn't disrupted by the varying exposures which can take a lot of time. The Ricoh Theta S is a great introduction to the world of VR and is able to fit in such a small form factor that is extremely portable.As an avid Amazon shopper I rely heavily on reviews to research before purchasing items.

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B014US3FQI,Ricoh Theta S Digital Camera (Black),        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Close up stills very good.  Far away objects and video not so great.  January 11  2016By Dennis Mabrey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've had no technical issues with this camera whatsoever.  Hooked up to the PC fine and the Spherical software is basic but it does what it is supposed to do.  My android phone and tablet can connect and control the camera just fine over wifi as well.  Ricoh even has an app for the Samsung Gear VR in the Oculus store for taking and viewing images which works great.From a usability standpoint this camera has been flawless and easy to set up and configure.  It gets 5 stars for that.The body also ""feels"" sturdy. It doesn't feel cheaply made in the least.  Another 5 stars.Ok now the not so good.First you really need a smartphone (Android iPhone only) to set things like ISO exposure etc...  You can get by without one for just point and click but there are no settings on the camera itself.The real downside of this camera is the quality of the video and to some degree the stills as well.Videos can be poor (as in terrible) in normal lighting conditions.  Even inside an office with phosphorescent lighting produces bad looking videos.  Lots of noise and focus is always always always a bit blurry.  Things are much better in sunlight for video and is much more acceptable for usage outside.  Technically it is HD but when you take an HD video and wrap it around a 360 sphere it looks less and less HD and even worse than SD.In terms of noise reduction photos are better than video and you have options for noise reduction shutter priority and ISO settings (no aperture priority).Objects at more than 5ft are quite blurry so taking a 360 pano of a medium sized room doesn't look so good.  A picture of people sitting in a room is 'ok' but won't look as good as same priced camera with images stitched together.  My Samsung S6 can produce much much better looking images with 360 pano software (though I still have to pan the room).For close up objects (such as objects/food on a table near the camera) the focus is quite good (as in great).  I can see a ""foodie"" liking this camera just to take a snapshot of their meals.So for video it works best in sunlight.  Inside looks bad.  For stills the closer an object is the better.",0

The 3 or 4 times I've been successful it was only after deleting all my iPhone's wifi connection info (house work camera) making sure no background tasks were running on the iPhone cycling power on the camera and iPhone several times.  The iPhone and camera have no problem connecting the problem lies in Ricoh's app failing to recognize a connection has been made. Without Ricoh's app there's no way to remotely preview/trigger a picture.  Sadly the process is not repeatable (meaning if I go through the process described above there's no guarantee the app will work). The Ricoh website/manual instructions are of no help (tried all that before deleting all my personal wifi connection info) and neither is Ricoh customer support (they basically reiterated what their manual stated).There are a couple other apps in the app store I'll give those a try.  Otherwise the camera is solidly built connects well with the laptop via USB cable for picture upload/download. As most have already stated the design of the lenses on opposite sides of the camera make it somewhat awkward to lay it down.",0

July 5  2016By Nakuma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Have been enjoying this camera ever since I got it! The photos look great and the videos are a bit lower in quality but not to the point where it's just pixilated still looks nice.The build of the camera feels very sturdy though it's advised to still handle with care and though it does come with a pouch I highly recommend getting a hard case for it due to the dual lenses.Just as technology goes a better version of this will more than likely be out by next year though if you're hesitant on the current 360 degree cameras to buy today highly recommend this one. Feels nice looks nice and is slim to easily slide into your pocket unlike the others that are much more bulky.**Also one more thing (I may save a life with this review) when you download the PC/Mac application of Ricoh's software to view your photos and videos in a 360 degree view MAKE SURE you have the latest version of Adobe Air downloaded. Many users weren't able to get their application to launch and we're not aware they needed Adobe Air support. Hope that may help if you are lost!**,0

July 9  2016By Greg B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera has a lot of potential. It's exciting to put 360° camera in the hands of consumers. I have a few things I really love about this camera and a few things that have room for improvement. I will start with the pros: 360° video capture high quality picture capture compatibility with both iOS and Android free software from Richo's website for video processing simple to use and setup easy remote access to camera via smartphone. My main list of cons would be: low video quality (especially after it's uploaded to youtube) no expandable memory (you're stuck with 8 gbs) built in battery (video transfer's to your phone are slow and drain the battery) and very strict recommendations to charge/recharge the camera via a PC usb port (although my iPhone charging brick does the trick).

Mclaughlin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love this camera. The photos and videos are awesome. You need to be close to the subject for any kind of detail. The camera is easy to use. There are only 4 buttons on it. It can also be connected to your smart phone to use as a shutter release or to make changes to the settings. I bought this to make some 360 videos for my motovlog. I wanted to give my friends a feel of what its like riding the motorcycle. I mount the camera on a selfie stick connected to the sissybar on the back on my bike. I get a really cool 3rd person view of the bike and the surrounding environment. My main complaint with the camera is the recording time. 25 minutes sounds like a lot of time but if I am riding all day I can fill it up. The battery lasts longer then the recording time.This is good when the camera is mounted behind me. I can start and stop the camera with my phone but can't power it on/off. I just got a battery pack so I can plug in and charge the camera and leave it on for the duration of the ride.I have 2 videos on my youtube channel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWGL9IiG5sThe first video I handheld the camera and the second one was mounted behind me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkwiwg6mlA,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B014US3FQI,Ricoh Theta S Digital Camera (Black),        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       Good product for its price point.  June 10  2016By MQ,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It's a good tool for anyone getting into 360 video/images it is simple to produce 360 images/videos because their software does the automatic stitching of the two cameras.  For this price point you are not going to get or should expect clear images or video like what you would get from a 6 camera GoPro rig.  Unfortunately their software is biased towards compression speed vs clarity so videos tend to be on the soft side even though the original footage on the camera is relatively sharp.  It is understandable since the videos would be quite large if they did not compress it so much.  I look forward when they will produce another camera with higher resolution and maybe an external storage interface.  The current 8GB gives you about 45 minutes of video recording which is more than enough since the battery dies before that but it would be great to not have to constantly remove data from the camera to free up storage.,0

May 5  2016By Colin H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It does what it says it does. The pictures are pretty decent as long as you have even exposure. Doesn't do terribly well when one side is lit much brighter than the other. Video quality is just ok too despite the massive size. And it takes FOREVER to process. If you take a 10 minute video be prepared to not be able to use the camera for 10 - 15 minutes afterwards while it processes.As long as you know what you're getting into (new tech in a relatively new field) you'll be fine. Support isn't quite there yet the apps are still a bit quirky and clunky but if you know what you're doing it's relatively easy to navigate.Wish the battery life was longer or that you could power through USB while shooting to memory (currently the only way to power off USB/DC is when you're in streaming mode which requires a computer. Removable media would be nice too..,0

Make sure the video is displaying as 640x480 (mine was). VLC will also record the video but I didn't mess with that. I chose this cam because of the small diameter. It has good focus at 1.5 inches and beyond; many others on Amazon focus much closer if that is what you need. I used it to examine car engine cylinders through small (12mm) spark plug holes and could easily resolve cylinder wall honing marks. The built-in LED light is handy but the picture was far clearer in the dark reflective engine cylinder using a separate light (a handwired Mini-Maglite bulb in my case). This is also why pro photographers use a separated flash unit. The cam also comes with a magnet hook and most usefully to me a 45-degree mirror (~7mm OD) which threads securely onto the cam's housing. Using this basically requires external lighting since you again get too much reflected glare from the built-in lights. I also discovered the mirror has an almost imperceptible protective film you peel off- ah much better now! The mirror allowed looking 'up' at the engine valves etc with some twisting about. I'll probably use it mostly for fishing wires; just add on USB cables for longer reach. The bend radius on the cable is ~1/2 inch and tighter if you kink it.,0

It took a couple of tries to get the app to recognize the camera but once it did it worked well.  I had hoped that the camera woul dbe able to focus on objects really close to the lens but it appears that the minimim focal distance is a couple of inches.  Great for looking into wall cavities and other hidden places.  Ever wondered what was inside of .... this will let you see it.

December 3  2016By Bob N.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I really wanted to like this but it really fails to live up to expectations. If you point it across the room it performs like a low resolution camera which is fine and not unexpected.  However when used in obscured (dark) places relying upon the built-in illumination it performs poorly.  It seems like the light from the LED's spill into the field of view and overwhelm the camera.  I've used it to look into nooks and crannies of my engine and suspension and cannot make out what it's pointed at.  If I'm able to shine a flashlight into the area there is some resolution - but trying to manuver the cable and head orient a flashlight and position my phone for viewing is a total pain in the neck.IMO it's little more than a toy.  At this price I suppose it performs OK for some tasks.,0

February 20  2017By Amazon CustomerVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,For the price this camera is fine.  Would like an endoscope camera that either had an adjustable focus or a shorter focal length.  This camera has to be 2 or more inches away from the object observed to see the object in focus.  It runs nicely with Digital Viewer free software from Pluggable on my Windows machine and with CameraFi on my Android phone.  I tried a WiFi camera previously.  Problem with the WiFi cameras is you have to use the camera manufacturer's crap software.  This camera doesn't limit the type software to use.  I bought two of these cameras.  The lens fell off of one.  I'm still using it; the lens is for sealing not for optics.  Suspect the claim of being waterproof is an oversell which really isn't necessary for a product at this cost.  I wish there was a mid range version that had better camera quality.  Seems like there are only low end units for a couple bucks and medical grade units for a couple thousand bucks.  Would have been happy to pay 3x to 4x the amount for a better quality camera.,0

Adjustable LED's on the head are easy to use software worked on the first try and the included retrieval kit was a nice surprise (I do wish something was included to help keep the camera and the little tools together or organized).

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01BV14I40,Canon PowerShot SX720 HS (Black),        221 of 241 people found the following review helpful       Great Photos and Sharing  April 3  2016By G. Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great PhotosThis is my third Canon point and shoot and I am not at all disappointed so far.  The second in the PowerShot SX...HS line.  My previous SX260 HS is still going strong -- though scuffed up from heavy use.  I will miss the built-in GPS feature of my previous Canon but since it didn't work indoors anyway I won't miss it that much.  I bought this model to go from 20x to 40x zoom.  The wide-angle is 24mm equiv. full telephoto is 960mm equiv. (which on a DSLR that would be a VERY BIG lens).  ( For comparison only - the 20x zoom of the SX260 HS was 25mm equiv. to 500mm equiv. both have the same sensor size)  The 40x is a tiny bit wider and way closer so it isn't twice as close as my old camera (more like 1.9 times closer at max zoom).  The 20 MegaPixel rating doesn't change the actual output resolution much.  Max Res on this camera is 5184 x 3888 (compared to 4000x3000 on the SX260 at 12MP).  I attached a comparative max zoom to this and my review on the SX260 HS.  Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) (OLD MODEL)I plan to do some low-light shot comparisons soon.SharingMaybe I'm weird but I often find myself photographing something really cool and taking photos and then pulling out my smart phone to take a smart-phone picture that I can share immediately.  Maybe it's not as good as the one I took a minute ago (for one thing the zoom just isn't there).  No need anymore.  Just tap the back of a smartphone to the side of the SX720 and 30 seconds later I have a list of photos on the camera that I can copy over to my phone.  Select Menu (to signal I'm done selecting) OK Confirm screen: OK again and the selected images appear on my phone.From there I can e-mail or post to social media without compromising on quality.The very initial setup did take some time.  There's a sweet spot on most smart-phones that are not obvious (the sweet spot on the camera is clearly etched into the side).  Once that was found everything else was set up within about 15 minutes.  There are tutorials on Canon's web site and YouTube if you want someone to show you.I didn't really consider this feature deeply when I pre-ordered this camera and I've been surprised that it is already a game-changer for me.,1

I have had the Powershot series for several years now and the amateur photos I take with it have earned me 4 awards including ""grand prize"" and ""people's choice"" in 2 years against professional photographers with much more complicated equipment.  This camera is lighter and more compact that its predecessor model with a better zoom. It also take better landscape photos.  The Image World is also first rate to deal with I did have an issue with the first camera sent and the staff of The Image World have been quick to respond and are sending a new replacement.

May 5  2016By Duncan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I was trying to decide between the Canon SX710 and the Nikon S9900 both being 30x zoom and leaning towards the Canon but was fortunate in seeing that Canon was about to release a 40x zoom in the SX720 HS. I am delighted with the SX720. The screen is beautiful - as clear as an actual photograph  and the zoom is just amazing. The built in electronic 2x converter makes that an 80x zoom with even a 160x possible digitally. The software is just amazing - the camera can even take pictures by itself if a designated face in the picture smiles or winks! I primarily use the ""Auto"" setting but every other conceivable option is available - shutter or aperture priority manual just being a few. I really like the separate button for HD video too. It has an option to take about a 4 second video before each still shot it you want. It then collects these video shorts into a monthly album. All in all it is a beautiful camera light and sub compact as well so I can carry it at all times. It fits perfectly in the hand and has a pop up flash to reduce red eye. I highly recommend it for those like me who enjoy super zooming.",0

I chose the Canon Powershot SX 720 HS. I am really glad that I did.  If not for the WIFI I would have called it a 5 star camera..My main use is taking snaps of the grandkids. The 40X zoom gets a close up head shot even when I am sitting on the first base line and he is in left field deep left field of a little league ball field.The antivibration feature really work well. The problem with the 40X turns out not to be the vibration but finding a moving subject in the field of view. There is a special  button for that..The attached pic was taken as a snapshot not planned and freehand no tripod or even a rest on anything like a post. If you figure the plane was at about 30000 feet?? then this was taken of a plane about 8 miles away . No it isn’t the greatest quality but it sure does say something about the antivib and 40X.  I would point out that to the naked eye the plane was a silvery speck at the end of the contrails.As evening falls and it is hard to see the players well the light sensitivity is so good that the pics and videos look like they were taken on a bright day. Awesome.. The controls are intuitive for the most part. The pic trigger and video trigger are where I would want them. Autofocus is great unless you start straying off the beaten path. Some of the options will cause the focus to get a little weird.I was surprised that the image size didn’t jump way up from the 5 meg I was used to on the Nikon. Compression in the jpg format??The one thing I really didn’t like was the WIFI upload option. I downloaded the drivers and was able to get the camera to talk  with the network. Even when I can see that the router has the connection the program to upload doesn’t pop up reliably. When it does load and start to run in looks like it is shipping the files into the Comcast backbone according to the Netgear  Genie program. It ties up most of the 30 mbps that Comcast gives me. I don’t understand why it would be touching the internet and by the way it was extremely slow uploading.The attached pic show what Netgear Genie thinks the load on the internet is while loading pics from the camera to the laptop. I really don't know why it even touches the internet maybe that isn't what Genie is telling me?I called Canon tech support and they told me that I could hardwire with a USB2 to mini-B cable. I ordered it and it didn’t fit.Another call to Tech support and no it wasn’t the mini-B it was the micro-b cable.I ordered it and after tuning the software options it works. Every time and a bunch faster. My recommendation is that you get the hard wire USB micro-B cable.One more comment about Wifi. The camera is designed with a thicker section on the right hand side while holding it. It is natural to use this thicker section to pull the camera from it’s case and put it back. The location of  the wifi button is right where you would hold it to put it  away. Twice I have had a dead battery because I accidentally hit the wifi button when storing it and it drained the battery.Given a choice I would have it removed…All told I am EXTREMELY pleased with it. Focus speed. Light sensitivity small size 40X zoom 1080P video large memory options what looks like accurate colors and a good path to upload to my laptop. What more can you want??An addition After some quality time on a ""great Adventure"" with the grandkids. The Pic review button does the same thing the Wifi button does. Both drained the battery when pushed thru the soft case. I have yet to find the right hardcase that the camera will fit in. I intend to make a cover for those buttons and tape it in place. Really a pain when the battery is dead when you want to take that magic pic!!  Too bad there isn't a firmware option to disable them.Canon PowerShot SX720 HS (Black)",1

July 31  2016By Bergheil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,As a bicycle tourer and enthusiastic point and shoot amateur photographer I look for maximum performance in the smallest package. I found that in the Canon PowerShot SX720 HS. It is a little bigger and heavier than other compact digital cameras but the advantages you get from it easily make up for this. Between this camera and my iPhone I am as compact as possible. I can capture quality images wirelessly transfer them with the Canon Connect app to my phone and then send them to family and friends. The fantastic zoom gives me the ability to reach out and grab the shots which were not possible with my previous camera. The Super Vivid mode can turn a boring dim sunset into a print you are proud to show to others. I almost feel guilty when I receive compliments on the photos as the camera did it not me.,0

Unfortunately this camera will not display movies on the screen.  You get a ""Incompatible JPEG"" message.  Neither Canon Community nor JustAnswer could give me a solution.  JustAnswer said my files were corrupt or unsupported.  NOT!  Here is my solution but I don't know why it works:  when the ""incompatible"" message is on the screen press the FUNCSET button then select ""Play Linked Digest Movie.""  The movies will run on the screen.  This also works when ""SET"" appears in the upper left corner of the screen with or without the JPEG message.  After writing this review I still had problems viewing photos on the camera so I sent the camera battery and memory card to Canon Service (before doing so I copied all photos to my laptop).  Canon Service's report said the camera was working normally - no charge.  I got everything back but the photos had been erased presumably through reformatting.  I prefer to leave my photos on my camera so I can share them with friends.  After a while I copy them to my laptop and delete them from the camera.  I've taken a few new photos with the camera and I haven't had problems viewing them.  I'll be taking more tomorrow at the zoo.

September 5  2013By JJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Initial impression: It's hard to believe what this camera's capabilities are until you've used one.  I have bags full of camera equipment including a Mamiya RB-67 Pentax 6x7 Canon 5D Mk2 Canon T2i and a lot of glass so trust me when I say this camera lives up to the pre-release hype.  I originally had my sights set on the Canon SX50 which is a good camera but falls short of its Lumix peer.  My focus was to get an easy to use point-and-shoot camera for my wife since the SLRs were just too much for her to handle - but now she's going to have to fight me for it.  I will update this review as I gain more experience with the video and special functions (which there are many) in the future.  Until then I recommend you get one while the price remains well below $400 because I don't think it will stay their long when the word gets out how great this camera performs.UPDATE: After using this camera for nearly 6-months I am still VERY happy with it and the pictures it produces - and would be glad to share some of the shots.  I find the extremes between other reviewers ratings interesting since I have not experienced many of the negatives mentioned and have experienced most of the positive remarks.  This camera simply works for me.  I've shot everything from sports car road races to retirements to scenery with great success and carrying this 1 lb 7.2 oz camera sure beats the heck out of hauling my 12 lbs of 5D Mk 2 with dual battery pack and 50-500mm Sigma lens around all day plus a couple extra lenses and batteries in a camera bag.  I also have no trouble taking my shots to 13x19 inch prints from either RAW or JPEG format files.  I've also read this camera is big and bulky.  Well if you wear XXL gloves like I do it fits just right in my hands.  It also works much better in my wife's hands than the DSLRs we have (T2i in addition to the 5D)so she is happy too! The weight is simply not a concern to us as we've both carried it around all day without any problems or side effects.  In fact now that the price has dropped to $249 I'm going to buy another one to keep peace in the family.Several reviewers mentioned soft pictures at the 1000 to 1200mm end of the zoom range.  I'd bet your paycheck that most of the problem is camera movement since it is very difficult to hand hold any camera still enough at this extreme magnification to get a super sharp picture - regardless of image stabilization system employed.  I've had much better luck using a monopod or even better a solid tripod (as one reviewer suggested) to get those very sharp long range shots.I also discovered the automatic backlit scene sensing and exposure system when I moved to the fully automatic setting - very effective!But as I said the proof is in the final product so if you would like to see a sample of images - reply to this review and include your email address and I'll share a few with you.,1

September 4  2013By Rolla Gravett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Update: 11/17/2014.  I have used the camera for several months now and love it.  I really like the zoom range of the camera from 20mm to 1200mm and it is my main daily carry camera.  It takes great detailed photos and the noise levels are very good.The is going to be a quick review on the camera and I will add more as time goes on.  The FZ70 takes really good sharp photos but hand held might be a problem in lower light levels.  I went out yesterday evening and took some shots hand held and they all came out blurry.  I should have paid more attention to the shutter speed.The camera works fantastically in iA which is the auto mode. I mainly use Aperture but was impressed with the auto settings.It will go with a 60 second exposure in the Starry Sky Mode which is under the SCN mode on the main dial.The lens thread is 55mm so if you plan on using your filters from any other Pany camera you will need a 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.  Amazon has them for cheap.  I don't think vignetting will be a problem using 52mm filters as the lens is way smaller than the filter threads on the camera.  Here is the 55 to 52mm Step Down Adapter.Goja 55-52mm Step-Down Adapter Ring (55mm Lens to 52mm Accessory) + Bonus Ultra Fine Microfiber Lens Cleaning ClothThe camera has no shutter remote cord jack so a shutter release cable will not work.  My Yongnuo YN-560 flash will not work on the camera either.  It physically hits the camera flash housing which is raised a little.  The answer to that is to use a wireless flash trigger with the Yongnuo Flash and that works fine.Addition:  I looked at the Yongnuo flash again and it will fit on the camera but it is a tight fit between the camera flash and the Yongnuo flash housing.  I modified the Yongnuo flash by taking some of the plastic off the flash housing where the camera flash is hitting with a pencil grinder.  It doesn't take much and it is right in the middle of the housing.  You could remove some of the plastic in the flash housing with sandpaper but it would take longer but will also give you more control of how much plastic you are taking off.  Now my Yongnuo Flash works perfectly on the FZ70 camera!The video does not have a progressive setting.  Interpolated is the best you are going to get with this camera.The FZ70 does not have a jack for a shutter release cable and does not have an infrared input either.  The camera has to be set to a timer delay within the camera for 2 or 10 seconds.  If it was a Sony or Canon the timer is set and stays on till you shut it off.  Unfortunately this camera requires you set the timer delay for each and every photo.The longest the camera will go on exposure under the Shutter or Manual Mode is 8 seconds.  In the Starry Sky Mode it will go 15 30 and 60 seconds.Like I said the lens thread is 55mm so your filters will have to be that size or use an adapter.  The camera will use a teleconverter with the DMW-LA8 adapter which is not available yet.  Addition:  Those LA8 adapters are available on Ebay now.  They are being sold out of Japan though.  I had that happen with the FZ200 camera as well and had no problem getting one from a Japanese Ebay member.  There are several teleconverters that work well with this camera but may not be needed as this lens rocks as far as zoom goes!Update:  An aftermarket adapter is now available for a good price.Lens Adapter For Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 (55mm) (Alternative For DMW-LA8)It will take Raw pictures but no one is supporting the FZ70 Raw files yet.  It will come.  Added: I found that FastStone will support the Raw files from the FZ70 and it is much better than Silkypix in my opinion.  Just Google FastStone and download and install the software.  It is free.Upadate: Raw for the camera is now supported in Lightroom and Photoshop.Start up time is very fast.  I was able to take a picture in one second after turning the camera on.The focus button is on the top of the camera now.  The AF/MF/Macro button is on the right side of the LCD instead of on the camera lens.One thing I have noticed with this camera is the noise or should I say the lack of noise!  The shots I took at ISO 800 and ISO 1600 still look pretty good and at ISO 100 noise is hard to find.The camera will zoom to 60X (1200mm 35mm Equivalent) in the 16mp picture size.  Setting the picture size to 10mp will give you 75X zoom setting the size to 7mp will give you 90X at 5mp you get 108X and at 3mp is 135X.  This is Extended Optical Zoom.  If you need more zoom than that under IResolution use I-Zoom for an additional 2X at all picture sizes and digital will give another 2X but image quality will suffer. I took some shots at the 10mp picture size with I-Zoom on and the photos in my photo software are showing 3030mm zoom and they look amazingly good! I will post a link to some shots in the first comment on the review.There are two FN buttons on the camera that can be set the way you want them to be.  I set FN 1 button to Bracketing and FN 2 button to Flash Control.  I may change them as time goes on but I find it really great to be able to get Bracketing with the push of a button.I don't care much for the lens cap and ordered a better 55mm one on Amazon.eForCity 55mm Camera Lens Cap BlackI use filters as it seems more often than not I end up with my fingerprints on the lens filter.  It also keeps dirt and grime from getting to the lens.  It might offer some protection in an accident too. I would stay away from Hoya UV filters on this camera.  I was using one for a while and noticed the photos look fuzzy at full zoom.  I discovered it was the Hoya HMC filter I was using.  I now use a Sigma UV filter on the camera and it works great with no distortion at high zoom.Sigma EX DG 55mm Multi-Coated UV FilterThe camera does not come with a lens hood and none is available in the Accessories on the Panasonic web site either.  It seems there is no lens hood for this camera at this time.This is it for now.  I will add to this review as time goes by so check back often.Addition:I had a chance to check out the high speed picture mode with the camera and found this:  At 2 fps (frames per second) all works as advertised and it takes 2 fps for an extended period of time. 5 fps - it takes 5 frames per second for 3 shots and goes back to the 2 fps rate.  I tried it in Auto Focus mode and the regular mode with the same results.  9 fps - Once again 3 shots and then the 2 fps rate.  H Mode - the camera took a very fast rate of speed (at least 9 frames per second) for 9 shots or 1 second.  I have since found in the manual that at that speed the picture size is 2.5 or 3 mp.  I forgot which.  That is excellent.  The last mode is the Flash and it will take 5 quick photos with flash before stopping.  That could come in very handy at times.I really like this camera.  I like the menu system on the Panasonic Cameras too.  I have the Canon SX50 as well and still have problems with the menu settings and I have had that camera for 6 months.  The menu system just doesn't make sense to me on that camera.I did a shootout with the Canon SX50 the Pany FZ200 the FZ70 and a Sony Nex 6.  The FZ70 images look about the same as the Canon SX50 and in my mind better than the Pany FZ200 camera.  The last shot is a Raw shot from the FZ70 camera converted to JPG.  The picture files can be seen in the Comments on page 12 the 7th post.Added:  After using this camera for a while now  I am even more impressed with it.  It takes great pictures and I really like the Panasonic Menu which is laid out well and easy to use.  I am getting lots of keeper photos and the lack of noise in the shots is really appreciated!Addition 10-29-13  I sent the first FZ70 back because the photos at high zoom were soft.  To make a long story short it turned out that the Hoya UV filter I was using on the camera was responsible for the soft photos.  I have changed to a Sigma DG 55mm filter and the results are outstanding.  Sharp clear photos at all zoom levels.  This camera takes photos every bit as sharp and detailed as the Panasonic FZ150 or FZ200 camera and is as good as the Canon SX50 in sharpness as well.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DY2Y28M,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP…,        73 of 76 people found the following review helpful       Most amazing camera!!!  August 25  2014By TheWaldo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The zoom range on this camera is unbelievable.  The base camera has a 60X zoom range making it the longest of any camera available at the moment. The total zoom range in mm is 20 - 1200 mm which is very impressive. Standard SLR lenses with those types of ranges would require several lenses and untold thousands of dollars......plus the cost of the camera itself. Yet this Lumix jewel accomplishes all that and more at a scant fraction of the cost. The camera is easy to operate has an incredible amount of built in features and much more just waiting to be discovered by experimenting.  An added bonus is the ability to extend the zoom range by selecting image resolutions less than the full 16.1M.  While there are those who will always want to shoot at 16.1M for me it is overkill.  Image resolution is a subjective issue. It is simply a matter of what you want to believe and are willing to settle for. I currently use a Sony DSLR compact camera like this Lumix a Nikon D50 with several lenses but usually coupled with a Tamron 18 - 200. This D50 is a 6.1M camera and I have shot and enlarged flawless prints at 11 x 14 with total clarity. Some may take issue with this statement but excessive megapixels in a camera is much like owning a car that will run 150 mph when all you can go on the highway is 55 mph.  The capacity is there..........but when if ever are you going to utilize it.  Now if you are a professional photographer or a serious amateur and routinely enlarge to 16 x 20 or even 20 x 30 or more.....that is one thing. But if your basic need is for standard 4 x 6 prints and an occasional 5 x 7 or even an 8 x 10 then your eye will be hard pressed (if even able to) discern any difference between a 5M photo and a 16M photo.I said all that to say this........one of the great features of this camera is the ability to increase the zoom range by selecting less than 16.1M resolution. I have taken it down all the way to 5M still get crystal clear pictures and this increases the zoom range from 60X all the way to 270X!  Yes you read correctly!!!  Then.....if you add the digital zoom you can end up with a total on camera zoom range of 675X.  Have you ever heard of anything like this?  Then for fun and games I took a Sony brand teleconvertor for my Sony that is rated for 1.7X and mounted it to my Lumix.  The standard filter size for the Lumix is 55mm but I had bought a Goja filter adaptor ring in order to be able to use my several hundred dollars worth of existing filters. Many of them are 58mm so I simply bought a Goja 55mm to 58mm adaptor ring and viola......instant filter availability. AND.....it just so happens that my Sony teleconvertor has 58mm threads and I was able to couple this right to my Lumix which now takes the 675X max zoom of the camera with izoom and digital zoom multiples it by 1.7 and now gives a total zoom range of 1147X.  That is NOT 1147 mm.............it is 1147X zoom range.Now.......I will admit the camera is a bear to use in a hand held mode but that is just what I did to see worse case scenario. I am going to post a couple of pictures taken hand held at these extremes so you can just see the potential this camera offers.  My my......we are almost talking spy type pictures from 10 miles off. I will let you judge the photos........not for clarity or subject matter.........but just for an example of the zoom range of this camera.  I will say this here........the bus in the photos was roughly 500 feet from my position and all photos were taken hand held from the same spot.But even without the impressive zoom features......this is one heck of a camera. The pictures even at 5M are crystal clear and will be certain to please. Then with all the built in special modes the 11 or more internal filter modes the 23 or so scene selection modes and full manual mode with shutter or aperture priority mode.........you can go any route that you need for your shooting needs.Another feature I like about this camera is that while filming a video you can press the shutter button and take a still photo. Or while viewing a video you can take still photos from the video. I am anxious to experiment with this more as I have a son in the band and I usually take multiple cameras to their concerts etc. in order to video it and also take some still shots. With this camera I am hopeful to be able to do both with one instrument.  We have the first White Shoe rehearsal this Thursday and our first football game this Friday.  It will be a time to see what this camera can really do with its zooming ability from up in the stands.In closing as a camera buff of many years (40+) I am well pleased with this purchase. I have had a Pentax SPII a Pentax ESII a Nikon N70 a Nikon D50 several smaller point and shoot type all in one cameras and now this Panasonic. For ease of use range of features and cost vs ability......I put this Panasonic Lumix at the top of the pack in features.  No it does not have the quality that either the Pentax or Nikons do.....but then again..........this camera cost a fraction of what they did and some of the individual accessory lenses I have bought for them in the past cost several times the cost of this camera............so it is not even a fair comparison. But for features...........my expensive toys cannot begin to compare with the ability of this camera. I am well pleased with it.  To see the zoom range please look at some of the photos I am going to upload.,1

Literally just point and shoot for great pictures. I decided to try the Moon shot because it should be very difficult to hold the camera steady. The moon picture on Aug 4 2014 was not done with a tripod. Think I might have a typo and put the 14th instead of the 4th but the picture is what is important. It came out very sharp for a  maximum zoom picture without a tripod. I will absolutely recommend this camera to friends and family.,1

February 17  2015By Krystle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have a very lengthy history with point and shoot cameras. I am a professional photographer so I suppose that I am spoiled by DSLR quality however Panasonic has never let me down. I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 when it first came out. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for the price that I had paid. Concert videos came out great and a lot of the photos were really good too. I still have that Lumix and my son now uses it.After dabbling with DSLRs for a while I decided that I wanted a more professional level point and shoot. I bought a Canon G12 and while it had some impressive features it just was not what I expected from the reviews I had seen. It was okay during concerts (one of the main reasons I have a point and shoot) but it wasn't something I was excited to use. After I sold the Canon I went to a Nikon Coolpix. I am an avid Nikon fan. That is the only DSLR I shoot with so I figured the point and shoot would be just as good. I was wrong. The quality of the photos was horrible and I couldn't get a clear shot to save my life. The Coolpix quickly went back. I stuck with the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 for a while and then went to a Nikon N1 J3. Again not great. I did not like how it handled but I have kept it around for a year.I was browsing reviews for cameras that are great for my upcoming trip to Disney. I saw this Lumix FZ70 listed so I did some more research. After reading reviews here on Amazon as well as other sources such as Ken Rockwell I decided that I would jump on the low price that I paid. Yet again Panasonic did NOT disappoint. I got the camera this morning so I have not been able to fully test it and will definitely update when I do but from what I have done so far today...IMPRESSIVE. The zoom is ridiculous and much clearer than I expected it to be at 1200mm!Below I posted a macro shot (holy crap!) and also posted a shot where the lens was at the shortest and then the longest length to show the power of the zoom. In the shot where you can see the entire street I put a red circle around the car that I zoomed in on. The red circle is in the center of the photo far far down the street. I cannot wait to get out there and test this camera's capabilities in Disney in a few months and then at a concert in May.,1

June 13  2014By I Am Celt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am an amateur photographer and prefer taking pictures of wildlife which includes insects and birds. The zoom on this camera allows me to get closer than I've ever gotten before! I have purchased many cameras on-line but most of them are returned because of the difficulty of using them...that is not true with this camera. I have had many Lumix cameras before and the only reason I upgrade is because they keep improving the range of the zoom. They serve well translate color well and are easy to operate.,0

So I was eager to receive my recent order of a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 - but to be blown away by its performance and quality - who would have believed you could get the equivalent of a $1000 DSLR for less that [$]?My main purpose in ordering this camera was to have a digital camera that was light easily portable and (most importantly) had a viewfinder. I have severe presbyopia and would be constantly taking off and putting on a pair of reading glasses to see the screen of my Samsung which was usually visually obscured by the ambient light of everyday outdoor shooting. This camera solves that problem as I hoped it would...but I discovered it could do so much more. I couldn't have imagined it possessed so many extraordinary features normally associated with only the most expensive DSLRs. Hand-held night photography? Check. Extreme macros? Check. In camera special effects? Check. And a zoom that has to be experienced to be believed (Check my photo in middle). Focus on a distant feature that literally can barely be seen from your current position and then slowly zoom out until you discover that it is so far away that in the full wide position of the zoom it has disappeared completely! Even has a ""hidden"" ability to make time-lapse video in the MINIATURE setting. Take pictures in reduced sizes for social media use or go full-blast RAW for Photoshop lovers. Be sure to download the full users manual PDF file for a course in this cameras many many features.To the cameras amazing feature list  add an exceptionally protective and handy carrying case with internal straps that allow the camera lens to be cuddled by the case and leave room from the neck strap as well...and I scarcely need to mention that the kit comes with a 16GB high speed SD card. I am a confirmed addict of Amazon and this cements that relationship once again. I am SOOooo happy.",1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DY2Y28M,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP…,        276 of 296 people found the following review helpful       Don't rush to judgement!  .. Update!  September 9  2013By S. Hock,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've only had mine a few days so my testing is admittedly limited. Please do not give up on this camera unless you have made some very careful tripod shots. Yes this camera is hard to hold steady as is any 300+ mm lens. The stabilizer is good but cannot overcome everything. Hand holding 1200mm is a tough job and requires excellent technique and a degree of luck!I used a heavy Bogen tripod on solid cement and made very careful shots at about 50yds and 75yds (auto focus) throughout the available f range at max zoom. I was quite surprised at the resolving power of the lens using ISO 100.My Nikon D5000 and Nikkor 70 - 300 EDIF zoom in RAW mode on the same subject is barely sharper.Laugh if you will but I used the SilkyPix software to examine the RAW and jpeg images. I did not find a difference even worth mentioning in raw and jpeg modes. I did not use the default picture settings in the camera. SilkyPix works just fine if you take a bit of time to learn to use it. I also own PhotoShop and have used it for over 20 years so it's not like I didn't have a choice.All images benefited from a bit of post processing just as all my D5000 and P7700 images do.I can see how some users might easily rush to judgement on this camera. But it shouldn't be about lens sharpness. Hold it steady and it will deliver very good results. Many of the review sites have not done a real good job of testing the camera yet. Buy it and make your own carefully controlled tests then decide.Hand held tests at very high magnifications are totally INVALID for lens critiquing purposes. Few people can hold that long lens steady enough. High ISOs will certainly help keep shutter speeds high but it's the high ISO NOISE then that will ruin the image sharpness .. not the lens.Use a SOLID tripod to test the long zoom for yourself. Do it at ISO 100 first.At my work photographing motorcycles indoors hand held under less than optimal lighting I have used the camera at ISO 1200. Plenty of noise but these images are used at 1024 x 768 (72 dpi) on the internet. The noise at that size and resolution is invisible and the available light shots are quite usable..The weakness I see and have not found a solution for is highlight clipping. In my tests light subjects were hard to hold detail in. Perhaps further experimentation with the picture controls may help. Noise seems to creep in early too.We can't have it all. Twenty to 1200mm is an amazing accomplishment for Panasonic. Remember this is a consumer level camera. At this price point it seems to represent a very good value and a very versatile photographic tool. Perfect? No. None of them are.My previous Panasonic was an FZ35 which once I learned to use it properly was an truly excellent camera. This one probably has a steep learning curve too.Giving a star rating was hard. With so little testing I hated to rate it yet. Too low ... too high??My advice is forget the ""stars"" and test the camera on YOUR own favorite subjects then decide if it's any good. But be fair to the camera and be sure any problems you encounter aren't YOUR personal technique problems.September 302013In the end I just could not love this camera. I wanted to but I couldn't. I bought it mostly for the long end of the zoom but what I think is a decent lens is hampered by some other factors. Maybe the sensor maybe the camera software I don't know. I shot a lot of long zoom photos in bright light and high shutter speeds and for me it just wasn't quite there. High ISOs significantly mar the images after 250. If you do a lot of tripod work maybe this will work out for you. If the lens were ""faster"" ( like the FZ200) it might be much better but it is what it is. The combination of sensor noise and slow lens at zoom combine to make less than optimal images when hand holding.Don't get me wrong I did get some very nice images from the camera but I had to shoot a lot of frames and be very selective of the images. I'm not saying this is a BAD camera. It just didn't totally please me.I did like the 20mm aspect of the lens and used in shorter focal lengths I thought it did very well. I'm sure many will find this camera very useful and perfectly satisfactory. I personally will wait a wee bit more for the next round of improvements and try again.Compared with the really excellent images from my P7700 I just couldn't justify keeping it. DARN! Bottom line is I'd rather have a somewhat shorter zoom with a faster lens and a less noisy sensor that makes better images. I'm gonna miss that 20mm though .....",0

September 26  2015By ebragg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love this camera!  I bought it for the long zoom and have been truly impressed.  It takes great videos even with the zoom but I had to purchase a monopod to help steady it--it can be hard to keep it on the subject when you've really zoomed in.  The colors in my pictures have been very vivid too and it does well in low light.  I am particularly impressed with how well it did taking a picture of the moon--it looked more like something you'd see through a telescope.  It doesn't do as well with action shots as my Canon but I'm still happy I bought it because of the great zoom and the price was much cheaper than any of the other cameras I looked at with comparable zoom capabilities.  I'm just a point-and-shoot kind of photographer and though it has lots of settings I will probably never figure out it's simple enough that even an amateur like me can take great photos.,1

I've been using it for months now and it is hands down my go-to for every day shooting. The menus are jam-packed with functionality and if you're like me post-processing is minimal in most situations. I love this camera and it has truly increased my confidence level in taking stunning pictures...It's a blast to play with and to find just what 'style' you prefer for images.

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00I8BIBCW,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera…,        666 of 700 people found the following review helpful       A good snapshot device for its price...  August 28  2014By Muttley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am an amateur photographer and own three DSLR cameras with a selection of lenses. However that collection does not eliminate the need for a handy item for just daily needs. I keep this one especially in my car's glove box as a reserve for occasions which require something better than my cell phone camera. For that purpose it meets my expectations and even exceeds it. Yet this is still a snap shot device with a relatively low price tag and therefore  a DSLR level quality (like background blurring high shutter speed high level of low light performance etc.)should not be expected.Pros:-Lightweight slim and  stylish design: It can fit in small spaces and look and feel like a high quality item.-USB charging ability: That is one of the selling points for me. I keep it in my car and I don't want to run out of power any time or go through the hassle of removing the battery and charging it separately which requires carrying the charging adapter all the time and also the ability to plug in that adapter. Instead. all I do is to connect it to my 12V car USB charger and it pretty quickly accumulates good amount of charge level... It comes with a wall adapter (5V 0.5A) which connects to a detachable USB cable (so you can use the cable and attach it to any USB charger). But be careful about the USB cable. The standard USB-micro B cable that charges most mobile devices do not work for this type. If you need a replacement or an extra you need to buy a USB-UC E6 cable.-Easy menu mode: Practicality should be the main focus in a snapshot device and even my grandfather could get through this menu. One of the most user-friendly interfaces I have seen so far.-Panoramic shoot ability: That was a surprise for me. I had not read the product description in detail before buying and that was such a handy function. I used to take panoramic photos by taking tens of photos with my DSLR and stiching them with a software which was both difficult and time consuming. This function does it instantly and produces comparable quality photos.-5X optical zoom: When it comes to zooming in photographic terms the less is often more. The best lenses even come with no zoom at all. However for a practical item like this zoom is essential and 5X is a good range for the optical zoom (it is also critical that you compare the optical zoom capacities of devices and not the digital zoom before making a judgement.)-Image quality: As I said above it does not match the quality of a DSLR and I don't care about the high pixel size either. For cameras with small sensor sizes like snapshots it is actually better to get a low MP device for sharper images but this one not bad at all especially in daylight. HD Video quality is also good but again depends on the light...-Price: the $78 price tag as of august 2014 makes it one of the most affordable snapshot cameras in the market. You can get better deals from time to time but this is quite appealing too.Cons:-Low light performance: Again I want to stress that I am not expecting professional quality from this device but I found the low light performance moderate at best. The noise was somewhat irritating even with flash.-Slow shutter speed: It has a continuous shooting mode which is supposed to take multiple frames in a short time as long as the shutter button is depressed. However this device has a long long refractory period between shoots that it is not even worth bothering with that mode. You need to decrease the image quality 3 steps to be able to notice some multiple shooting effect and that is not worth it. So if you wish to take a photo of a flying bird or a running person or a passing by car you don't have much choice to take multiple photos and decide later.-Zoom buttons: I like the zoom to be a ring style beneath the shutter button but this is like a plus and minus at the back which is not very convenient.-No optical viewfinder: This is not a problem for this model only. Most recent cameras sacrifice from an optical viewfinder and all you get is a digital image on the screen to help you adjust your photo before taking it. First of all it does not give the sense of taking a photo but more importantly digital screen viewfinder drains battery and also performs bad in bright light.-Video focusing sound: While recording video of a closely located object (where there is a constant need to re-adjust autofocusing) and if the surrounding is silent you can hear the sound of focus adjustments in your recording. But as I said that is only obvious in full silence and for short distance recordings.Overall you like it or not depends on your expectations. For me it is a handy and adequately performing device with quite useful features. I am happy with this purchase,0

An SD card is absolutely necessary the internal storage can only hold 3 maximum quality images.I did have one problem with the camera the battery that came with it refused to take a charge. Amazon made up for this by offering me a 40% refund to buy a new battery and the battery was much cheaper than the $31 refund I got so this issue wasn't even reason enough to take a star off. Overall great camera and great customer service from Amazon.I've only owned this for a month and only used it for 2 days for a hiking trip so I can't speak on long term survival of this camera.

I use the camera for work so it's either in my pocket or hanging around my neck.  I go into damaged buildings so it's subjected to banging around and dusty conditions.  that's probably why the Cyber-shot died.  I thought I'd try the Sony W800 since it was a fraction of the cost and obviously because of my work environment I didn't feel a major investment was justified.  As others have reported it definitely is lighter and has a ""cheaper"" construction feel to it.  The bigger issue to me is the quality of the pictures.  The W800 has a CCD sensor where the Cyber-shot has a CMOS sensor.  I have experimented with all the settings and don't feel I've been able to match the quality you get from a CMOS sensor. Secondly the view screen is not as clear and you absolutely need to looking at it straight on.  There display is distorted if you are off to the side. One other feature that bugs me is the flash is positioned right below the trigger.  Why would you put the flash on the camera where you are holding it to take the picture?  I have plenty of pictures where my finger has blocked a portion of the flash.  Again it's for work so I'm not looking to frame anything I take but it is below what I'm used to.  Again for the price it's adequate.  After this one dies I'll probably make a CMOS sensor the priority feature.",0

Terrible for travel if all of your gear is USB...except for this darn thing. I've had a lot of Sony cameras in the past and they were great..but this model is a joke.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00I8BIBCW,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera…, The picture quality is pretty good for the most part but not having enough ...  December 25  2015By RWmccurdyVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have mixed feelings about this camera. The picture quality is pretty good for the most part but not having enough manual control over the actual picture taking is a bit frustrating. I am not asking for SLR type of manual control but enough to get a good shot in many different lighting conditions. I find myself having to constantly override that automatic flash settings to ensure I don't get washed out pictures which are too bright because the flash wants to overcompensate for semi-lit conditions. My iPhone 6 plus handles low light situations superbly without a flash. Then when the flash is necessary it is not a blinding white flash that makes people know there was a flash used but a dual warm color flash that makes pictures look like they have natural lighting. The point of a flash is to compensate for low light not to overpower the low light and essentially be a light replacement. I am also quite disappointed with one major flaw that makes recording videos almost not realistic. The video recording resolution and optical image stabilization are fantastic. But again there is a downside. The motor that is used for auto-focusing is ridiculously noisy. So when you record a video with a moving subject which is kind of the norm you can hear the constant and agonizing sound of the motor running in the background. The only way to avoid this is to have a subject that pretty much does not move. This would totally defeat the purpose of taking a video. In conclusion this camera is a good one with good picture quality but it has its few downfalls that make it less appealing than the cameras that are on most mid-to-high-end phones. This camera is much better suited to outdoor conditions with plenty of natural light. Once it starts to get dark outside then the flash makes taking ""natural"" looking pictures very difficult.",0

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00I8BIBCW,Sony DSCW800/B 20.1 MP Digital Camera…,        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       Disappointed in Downhill Quality  January 29  2016By Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I had a similar Sony camera that gave out after almost ten years of use.  I wanted something as similar as possible to my old one and this looked on paper to fit the bill.  However in ten years the quality has gone downhill.  This is more shoddily made and the picture quality was worse despite a higher pixel count. It's small and portable but the picture quality was very low (compared to the similar camera I had owned and other cameras produced today.) The shutter speed was awful so I was consistently frustrated taking pictures of family and friends--which is why I bought the camera!  If you really don't expect much it's ok but spending a little more--or as I did spending *LESS* on an older model--yielded much higher quality photos.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00RBG6GBS,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50S 30X…,        610 of 637 people found the following review helpful       Excellent little pocket camera with an impressive feature set  March 24  2015By Pragmatist,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've been looking for a good quality point-and-shoot light-weight camera that fits in my pocket has a long zoom has a good viewfinder one that travels easily and not too costly.  Turns out there aren't many choices that fit all these criteria.  I enjoy photography am a highly experienced photographer although not a pro and have a really good camera with interchangeable lenses etc. which I use when I want to get top quality pics and need to have a lot of control over focus depth of field mounted flash etc.  However when traveling by air hauling all that equipment around taking up space in carry-on luggage etc. tends to make me leave the really good camera at home.  With pocket cameras I've used I really miss having a viewfinder.  I find them awkward to hold steady and difficult to see on the backside LCD panel exactly what I'm getting in bright light  or when I need to follow and catch fast moving objects (e.g. flying birds) particularly when the zoom is extended. I've been frustrated when I can't get the pics I want with those pocket cameras.So I went out on a limb spent a little more than I had intended and got the new Panasonic Lumix ZS50 which I preordered.  I seldom buy new models of anything when they first come out so for me this was a bit of a gamble.  However I have been pleasantly surprised so far with this little camera.  It has an amazing feature set for something that really does fit in my pocket has a good viewfinder and plenty of zoom.  I have not given it a true test yet taking thousands of pics under a wide range of lighting and distance conditions so I will have to report back later.What I like so far:- camera takes good pictures in the auto mode under most conditions- viewfinder works well in bright light conditions and switches on automatically when you hold it up to your eye- zoom and focusing are relatively quick and quiet- the steady shot feature works well especially in shooting video- flexibility and control in non-auto modes (e.g. program mode when I want more control over depth of field etc.)- several different focusing and exposure methods- ability to save images in RAW format as well as JPEG- the right hand grip feels fairly secure for such a small cameraWhat I don't like so far:- viewfinder is off-center when holding the camera compared with what I'm used to with larger cameras so I can't grip it as securely with my left hand (because my nose is in the way) BUT I love having that viewfinder anyway!- lots of MODES in the menu system for settings (I eventually found that I needed to switch to program mode in order to find settings I was looking for e.g. to save pics in RAW format change focusing methods).  Can be confusing at times a bit of a learning curve.- the LCD display sometimes suddenly turns off and then back on which had me baffled initially when playing back pics.  Turns out I had moved a finger too close the the viewfinder which fooled the camera into auto-switching to the viewfinder.- when taking flash pictures it's too easy to partially block the flash somewhat on the right side which casts a shadow--just something I'll need to get used to by gripping a little differently on the right side (I've had this problem with other pocket cameras that don't have pop-up flashes).  Works fine when I move my fingers down on the right-side grip a little.- when doing the wi-fi setup I could not enter user names or passwords that had spaces in them--I am stumped on this and cannot understand why Panasonic would not allow selection of the 'space' character!!!- wi-fi will not transfer pics in RAW format so have to use cable or take out memory card and plug into my computer--again why?  Granted 15 Mb per pic will take a lot longer to transfer than smaller JPEGs.- cannot charge battery outside of camera and must use Panasonic's cable- not sure yet whether 12 megapixel sensor will be enough resolution for severely cropped pics printed at 8x10 in. or largerAll in all this is hands-down the best pocket camera I've owned and used.  Why not 5 stars?  I'll need to really give it the ""road"" test by taking thousands of pics under a wide range of conditions.  Haven't had time to do this yet and plan to edit this review later when I have.Added Comments:  April 26 2015I've changed my rating to 5 stars now after taking several hundred pictures under varying conditions.  Here are my further observations:- Indoor pictures with flash turn out fairly well.  There are still sharp background shadows from objects illuminated by the flash but that is to be expected with a direct flash (compared to one with indirect lighting e.g. by bouncing light off the ceiling).- outdoor pictures are quite good on the whole.  The 30x zoom certainly provides some additional flexibility and I have not had issues with camera shake when the zoom is extended.- the one very challenging condition I was somewhat disappointed with was photographing fast flying pelicans at a distance on a very windy overcast day.  Many of the photos of the birds were taken at distances of several hundred yards up to half a mile using the zoom extended out to 30x.  I WAS able to track the birds relatively easily using the viewfinder. When later viewing the images with significant cropping on a flat screen HDTV clarity of the images left something to be desired--a bit fuzzy on the edges of the birds against the cloudy sky. This is a very challenging set of circumstances--even with a good DSLR camera with a long telephoto lens it would be challenging to get high quality pics.  All in all the Panasonic ZS50 did a remarkable job considering the distance involved with background of a cloudy sky the speed of the flying flock of birds and the fast panning required. The severely cropped images of the high flying birds still allowed my wife to identify them as white pelicans by comparing with pictures in her bird book.- I took some pics of blossoms and flowers with the camera just a few inches away using the close-up focus setting on a sunny and very windy day.  These came out exceptionally well.  I was very pleased with the results.  The pictures were quite stunning on a flat screen TV.All in all I am quite impressed with this pocket camera and enjoy taking pictures with it since it is so light has a decent viewfinder and takes good photos.  I use the Program mode mostly rather than the Auto mode.  Of course I can get great pics with my really good camera but I've invested roughly 4x as much for the body lenses and external flash unit.  On the other hand this Panasonic ZS50 fits in my pocket is easy to use and costs a lot less.",0

March 28  2015By Cobra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,WoW!!!  I took a chance here because Panny doesn't provide options to tweak a lot of controls in this particular camera like most cameras.  However the results in every one of my test images were astoundingly good and probably better than anything I would have selected given the presence of those controls.  Some will view this as a negative and at first I was worried as well . . . but not now!  The images were all well balanced in highlights shadows color sharpness etc.  Panny has done a great job in balancing out the images.  The 5 Axis stabilization worked incredibly well even out to the maximum 720 distance.  Here again I was worried the images would be soft at that range . . . again I was delightfully wrong!  Panny was smart to lower the megapixels to just 12 given the small sensor here.  Noise was not an issue in any of my test images under conditions where there was reasonable light.  No doubt at night noise will creep in at higher ISO's but given the small sensor that is expected.Finally the much improved electronic viewfinder is what ultimately makes this camera so good.  No it doesn't quite equal my Fuji X100S EVF but it's remarkably good.  It adjusted very clearly to my aging eyes and even worked well with my sunglasses on in bright sunlight.  My primary camera is the aforementioned Fuji X100S but I needed a small long range camera and finally I've got the perfect complimentary tool.  No doubt a full DSLR with an 800mm Hubble telescope lens weighing pounds and costing thousands would take better pictures but for just $400 bucks I got a very nice really long range incredibly stable pocket shooter and I'm not complaining about the images at all.,0

I think some of the negative reviews ...  August 18  2015By Giants Fan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is an awesome camera.  I think some of the negative reviews are from people that don't take the time to learn how to use it correctly.  I was one of those people until I spent a ton of time going through the manual and playing with the camera to see what different settings do.  An example of something that I learned that made a huge difference when using the semi auto (Shutter Speed or Aperture) settings is what to do with your flash settings when taking outdoor pictures.  If you are manually setting your shutter speed and  flash is set to Auto it will never tell you that that speed won't work.  You could set it on 1/2000 and it will stay white (setting OK) because it believes the flash will fix it. The flash can't light up the whole outdoors!!  Turn you flash off  and it will go Red if you set the shutter speed to fast.  This is just one example of inappropriate settings causing bad pictures.  The zoom on this camera is incredible.  I posted two pictures taken from the same spot.  One no zoom the other fully zoomed (optical + digital 120x total) in on a toy that is in the middle of the first picture.  Pictures were taken with no tripod. It is beyond what I thought zoom could do on a compact camera!,1

Thought i should give potential buyers the good and bad.So far it seems to take good pictures from what i can see on the camera's screen or from my smart phone when i move pictures over.Now for the bad.There is already dust collecting under the top lens.  There is no way to clean it off.  This will only get worse with time.  Poor design to allow that to happen.Second problem is the mode indicator dial has wiped clean.  See the picture i loaded.  Whatever ink they used did not last more than 10 days.  Another poor design choice.I would think about returning it but cannot as i am on holiday with no way to return it and then replace it.  I am not confident of its long term reliability with what i can see in a few weeks use.  This camera is too expensive to last maybe a year and have to be replaced.,1

The only real negative review I read was that the paint on the round toggle switch to change modes and shooting preferences wore off.  I figured this was an isolated incident as there was only one complaint of this.  I purchased the camera and I decided to take this camera for a spin on my trip to Central America.  After the second day of shooting the paint on the toggle switch began to wear off.  By the 4th day of shooting the paint was completely gone leaving just a blank round toggle switch!  Perhaps this was from perspiration or sunscreen or just the friction from my finger on the switch.  I contacted the company I purchased it from (through Amazon) and was informed it was past the 30 day warranty so I called Panasonic and they told me to send it into their repair center in texas and the part would be replaced.  The paint is not supposed to come off that easily and he felt maybe there was a ""printing issue?!""  I of course have to pay for the shipping but the 1 year warranty covers the repairs.  In addition I had several occasions where the plastic 2 door shutter would not close all the way to protect the lense.  After shooting I would close the camera and the shutter would stay partially open exposing the sense to potential damage.  This problem resolved on it's own after turning the camera on and off multiple times but I assume it's going to be an intermittent issue.  For such a promising technological camera it's made very poorly.  If you do decide to purchase this camera I would HIGHLY suggest fashioning some sort of clear coat plastic cover over the round toggle switch to protect the letters from wearing off so easily.",1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00RBG6GBS,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50S 30X…,        99 of 107 people found the following review helpful       While the pics and photos are great  theres a lot NOT to like  June 18  2015By James M. Koury,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just returned from a two week trip to England with my family where I was able to put the camera through its paces shooting around 300 pictures and 5 hours of video.  While most of the pics and video looked great with its big sensor there is more to a camera than the quality of the pics/video....there is its functionality and build quality.  These issues were great enough for me that I am returning the camera in the morning and waiting for the next version that I'm sure will fix many of these issues.Body Issues.I have the Lumix ZS7 that I really appreciate now that I have used the ZS50.  why?  Because of the following:- The ZS50 has its flash right above where you grip the camera so your fingers more often then not will be blocking the flash.  Its fine if you always use two hands to grip this small camera so you can drop your right hand out of the way of the flash but there are many situations where I hold it with one hand and those are the ones where your fingers will keep blocking the flash (see first 3 photos).  And whenever I handed the camera to a stranger to take our picture they always blocked the flash even when I warned them about it. The ZS7 has the flash skewed toward the center of the body away from where you are gripping the camera where this is never an issue.- Bigger screen?  Its not all used for some strange reason.  Actually has a bigger screen but small image than the PS7 (see last photo)- The control knob that rotates between all the shooting functions is printed with a dull ink against a flat background providing very low contrast which makes it very difficult to read in low light situations.  The ZS7 had black lettering against a shiny silver background making it easy to read in low light. (see 4th photo...looks ok here in bright light but cant read in dim light)- When the camera is first turned on the lens extends out 3 times as far from the body as the ZS7 (see 4th & 5th photos for min and max extensions).  And this is in the wide angle position!! (ie it extends out even farther when zooming in on a subject).  This 4th image is as far in as it will contract when turned on for pics or video-The body has a textured plastic surface which I personally dont like as it feels cheap compared to the solid smooth gloss surface of the PS7.Functionality:- One of the most annoying things was its inability to focus on subjects when shooting video in what equated to bright dusk lighting (ie 1/2 hour after sunset).  I would repeatedly try to zoom in on a subject maybe 50 away but the camera kept searching for its focus point.  It focused if I zoomed all the way out but when I zoomed in it lost its focus again.  Isnt this supposed to be great in low light?!?  This happened about 5-6 times on various days/situations.  Never had this issue with the ZS7.  There is no excuse for this.- Another deal killer for me is that when shooting video its nearly impossible to zoom in or out at a slow rate no matter how light one feathered the control.  It flies in out out with the slightest touch.  When shooting video in most situations you want to pan slowly which is controlled by your body but also to zoom in and out slowly which was impossible.  When played back on a big screen the excessively fast zooming is very annoying.Summary deal killers for me were- fingers constantly in front of the flash.- difficulty in reading control knob in low light- problem focusing- inability to zoom and out slowlyAnnoying:- Smaller image on screen- Cheap feel of the body- Excessive extension of lens from bodyWhile these may not bother a novice photographer I'm  looking for a pocket size camera with better design and functionality to back up my professional SLRs...like my PS7 with a bigger sensor!,1

My one gripe and I was expecting this with a small-lensed camera is that it struggles in night-time conditions although it did well at dusk and dawn.Please see my photos for examples of what this camera can do.,1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00RBG6GBS,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS50S 30X…,        22 of 23 people found the following review helpful       > HIGHLIGHTS AND COMPARISON TO  NIKON COOLPIX  May 15  2016By Stoney,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm a retired professional photographer looking for a DSLR replacement for travel. This is NOT it.HIGHLIGHTS> At $300 a bargain (if the current price is higher just put it on your wishlist for a week or two).> USES:  This is a great travel camera---great for brightly lit scenery and street scenes.  This is NOT the best camera for taking indoor photos of your new baby or for indoor portraits.  It is NOT the best camera for sports or birds and butterflies (at long telephoto settings) because the image quality is marginal at long telephoto and you can’t effectively use high shutterspeeds to freeze action (because of the small maximum aperture at telephoto focal lengths)—see “shutter priority” below.---For indoor portraits (including baby photos) you want a ""fast"" lens and a decent flash (or even better a camera which can connect to an optional separate flash unit).  Portraits are best taken at about 120--150mm (in 35mm film camera equivalence) which works out to about 3X zoom on a point-and-shoot camera with a zoom lens.  In a moderately-priced camera that works out to a point-and-shoot with a F2.8 maximum aperture and a zoom range UNDER 5X or 10X.> The Lumix DMC-ZS50K has the ""usual"" point-and-shoot ""advanced"" features (such as video image stabilization panorama ""scenes"" and ""creative"") plus PASM modes (Program Aperture priority Shutter priority Manual exposure) manual focus an electronic viewfinder and other features.  Unfortunately aperture priority shutter priority manual exposure and manual focus are poorly designed or are not useful in practice because of the small sensor and limited aperture range (see below).  Aperture priority shutter priority manual exposure and manual focus are more selling points rather than useful features.> APERTURE PRIORITY:  The aperture priority option in the Lumix DMC-ZS50K is limited by a narrow range between F3.5–8.0 at the widest to F6.4–8.0 at maximum telephoto typically about F5.6–8 at intermediate focal lengths where you take most photos.  Therefore the choice of aperture (available in aperture priority and manual modes) really doesn’t make much difference.  You can't throw the background out of focus to highlight your subject (aka ""defocus"" the background) nor can you gain much additional depth of field for closeup photos.  That said I use aperture priority almost exclusively because I mostly take closeups where even the small additional depth of field at F8 is welcome.> SHUTTER PRIORITY:  Shutter priority has limited utility with such a narrow aperture range.  The only way the Lumix DMC-ZS50K can achieve high shutter speeds is by pumping up the ISO which degrades the photos.> MANUAL EXPOSURE:  I doubt that many users will find any use for manual exposure.  I find it very useful for taking close closeups with a small slave flash (see below).> MACRO FOCUS:  The Lumix DMC-ZS50K can focus commendably close---filling the frame with a subject 1–4"" high (depending on the focal length aka ""zoom"") in “Macro AF” mode.  But the highest magnification is ONLY available at the widest zoom settings at about ½"" between the lens and your subject.  It is a great feature and welcome but is not the same thing as having a macrolens on an interchangeable lens camera which allows you more working distance.> MANUAL FOCUS:  Manual focus on the Lumix DMC-ZS50K is barely usable—you’ve got to dig into a menu to select it (while in the meantime the butterfly has flown away). In comparison with my Lumix GX7 I can autofocus and then refine the focus manually simply using the focusing ring on the lens—NOT with the Lumix DMC-ZS50K.  With the Lumix DMC-ZS50K you cannot easily shift between auto and manual focus.  With the wide depth of field (because of the high maximum aperture [smallest F-number]) it is very difficult to manually focus.  “Peaking” (a special Lumix focusing aid) is a great help but even so manual focusing is difficult.  It would be great to be able to activate ""Peaking"" (say with the Fn2 button) while in autofocus mode (in which case you could shift the focus a few inches or even a few feet simply by moving the camera in or out) but that option is NOT available.> IMAGE QUALITY:  Under ideal circumstances specifically brightly lit subjects taken at less than 10X zoom (at ISO 400 or less) the photos can be very good but at longer telephoto or higher ISOs in poorly lit conditions quality suffers significantly---which is to be expected of ANY camera with such a small sensor.> RAW FORMAT: The Lumix DMC-ZS50K has the unusual ability (for a point-and-shoot camera) of being able to record images in RAW format (as well as JPG) which is commendable but which few users will actually use.> MISSING FEATURES: The  Lumix DMC-ZS50K lacks many features which could improve the image quality in the hands of a knowledgeable photographer.  These missing features include >> the ability to easily manually refine the focus after autofocus >> the ability to adjust the contrast hue and saturation and >> the ability to brighten shadows or darken highlights (such as the sky).  Note that contrast HDR and hue vividness and saturation adjustment are supported in options in ""creative"" mode (which I find useless) or IA but inexplicably are NOT available in PASM modes where they would actually be useful.> HARD TO ACCESS FEATURES:  You can control brightness after selecting a button---but this is such a frequently used feature that it should have a dedicated dial.  The ""Quck Menu"" commendably provides quick access to many options including ISO settings autofocus mode and video modes.  But the QMenu is not much faster or shorter than the main menu---it is cluttered with options which don't need to be on a ""Quick Menu"".  Oddly one of the few options missing from the ""QMenu""  is metering mode---which I often need to change.  To change the metering mode (e.g. from area to spot) you have to dig into the main menu.  It would be even better if users could choose the features on the QMenu (as I can with my Lumix DX7).> DISAPPEARING FEATURES:  For no logical reason I can fathom I’ve observed various features to simply become unavailable.  Those I’ve observed include: the assigned function of the Fn2 button ISO adjust and follow focus (tracking).  On occasions while in aperture preferred mode I’ve been unable to adjust the aperture.> VIEWSCREEN: The viewscreen is non-touch so you can’t for example adjust the tone curve (e.g. increase/decrease contrast or to brighten the shadows only or to darken the highlights only) or to drag the focusing-area box around the way you I can with my Lumix GX7.> FUNCTION BUTTONS and CUSTOM SETTINGS: You can program two function buttons.  For example I set Fn1 to adjust the metering mode (i.e. area center or spot) and Fn2 to enable repositioning of the focusing-area box.  Commendably you can define up to 4 sets of custom settings (which is the real secret to getting the most out of the Lumix DMC-ZS50K) and when you select custom sets 2-1 2-2 or 2-3 (from the custom menu) the custom settings for a variety of features is shown.  TIP:  name your custom settings (e.g. ""Fn1 bright daylight"" ""Fn2-1 dark"" ""Fn2-2 closeups"" or ""Fn2-3 sports"") make a list and photograph it and keep it as the first photo on your memory card for reference.> FLASH:  The built-in flash on the Lumix is almost useless even if by a miracle it isn't covered with your fingers.  However the built-in flash can trigger a small inexpensive ($15) slave flash (such as a PLR Studio Series Pro Slave Flash Includes Mounting Bracket For The Panasonic Lumix DMC-G3 DMC-GF3 DMC-G1 DMC-GH1 DMC-GH4 DMC-GH2 DMC-GH3 DMC-L10 DMC-GF1 DMC-GF2 DMC-G10 DMC-G2 DMC-GF3 DMC-G3 DMC-GF5 DMC-G5 DMC-GM1 DMC-GM5 DMC-GX7 Digital SLR Cameras) which can considerably extend your flash range and improve modeling.  Using this flash unit (or similar manual slave units) you control the brightness by the ISO setting of the camera (easiest from the QMenu).> ZOOM RANGE:  Arguably the ""30X"" zoom range is also more of a selling point than a feature since images taken at greater than 10X i.e. (240mm in 35mm film camera equivalence) the image quality significantly deteriorates.  Even with the excellent image stabilization you need at least a monopod to get decent photos much above 10X.– HOWEVER the long telephoto range is still useful since most users don't mind that bison or eagle a half-mile away is a little fuzzy.  Travel photos are more about memories and bragging rights than image quality.  RECOMMENDATION: don't buy a camera because it claims (for example) 30X instead of 25X.  The 25X image will be the better photo and a 20X image would be even better.– The Lumix has difficulty focusing at long telephoto (it will ""focus"" but the actual photos will often not be in focus).COMPARED TO A NIKON COOLPIX S9000 SERIES CAMERA> Physically the Lumix DMC-ZS50K is very similar to a Nikon Coolpix S9000 series (e.g S9700 S9900 and the older S8000 series) cameras (as well as the new Coolpix A900).  The feature mix and even the operating logic are very similar.  They are even nearly identical in size.> The Nikon Coolpix S9000 series cameras are impressive (I’ve owned two).  They take beautiful photos of almost anything in any circumstances.  The Lumix DMC-ZS50K is basically the same camera but with manual control over the aperture shutter speed and focus including “macro” and a few other Lumix advanced features.> ADVANTAGES of the Lumix DMC-ZS50K over Nikon Coolpix S9000 series cameras:  Although limited the Lumix DMC-ZS50K offers aperture shutter speed and manual modes manual focus and focuses closer than the Coolpix.  Although I rarely use it the Lumix DMC-ZS50K eye-level viewfinder is advantageous in very bright light and when following moving objects.  Manual mode on the Lumix DMC-ZS50K works well with slave flashes.  The ability to define 2 function buttons and 4 custom sets of features on the Lumix are not available on the Coolpix> ADVANTAGES of the  Nikon Coolpix S9000 series cameras over the Lumix DMC-ZS50K:  The color balance (hue) and degree of vividness can be manually chosen on Coolpix S9000 series cameras.  I find these options very useful in many circumstances.  These are NOT available on the DMC-ZS50K.> IMAGE QUALITY:  I’ve taken multiple series of side-by-side photos with the Lumix DMC-ZS50K and a Coolpix S9700.  The quality is very similar.  On the viewscreen the Coolpix photos look better because they are more “processed”.  The Coolpix enhances contrast saturation and applies sharpening the Lumix does NOT.  Because of this the Lumix photos are truer to “life” than the somewhat artificial photos of the Coolpix.  If you plan to work with photo editing program to improve your photos (especially if you use the RAW option) the Lumix is the best choice. If you’ll never use photo-editing software you’ll like the Coolpix photos better.  It is my impression that in the DMC-ZS50K the auto-white balance is more accurate (at least in bright sunlight).  However honestly I don’t think than anyone other than a professional photographer would notice the difference.> CONCLUSION:  Depending on the highly variable Amzn prices the often extra $200 for the Lumix DMC-ZS50K over a comparable Coolpix is hard to justify.  That said the Lumix DMC-ZS50K is my choice.> ALTERNATIVES: If you can live with a 10X zoom range (25-240mm equivalent---which most folks can) and shell out another $300 or so the LUMIX DMC-ZS100 (with a much larger sensor) is probably a better choice as a travel camera.  Since the sensor is four times the size you can think of the LUMIX DMC-ZS100 as having roughly the equivalent of 25-480mm on a Lumix DMC-ZS50K or on a Coolpix S9000 series camera---meaning that you can ""electronically zoom"" (aka ""digitally zoom"" which simply magnifies the central portion of the image) a LUMIX DMC-ZS100 image (at the maximum 240mm zoom setting) to the equivalent of 480mm and get about the same (or better) quality as an image taken with a Lumix DMC-ZS50K or a Coolpix S9000 series camera at (optical) 480mm.  You should NEVER use digital zoom on either Lumix DMC-ZS50K or a Coolpix S9000 series camera because (beyond maximum optical zoom) you are only magnifying an already barely acceptable image and making it worse.> Coolpix A900:  Although the Coolpix A900 shares many of the ""hollow"" features of the DMC-ZS50K (excessively long zoom range aperture priority shutter priority) and an excessively high 20mp resolution (which practically speaking adds nothing but reduces low-light capabilities) I'd seriously consider it for the tilting viewscreen.  I use the tilting viewscreen on my Lumix GX7 constantly when taking photos of flowers etc.  Since the camera has not been released at the time of this writing I don't know what other features it may have or lack.> Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews or leave a comment to ask a question.",0

The mode dial lets you switch to such settings as automatic program aperture priority shutter priority scene panorama etc.  I bought my ZS50 in May and by a month later the lettering had faded and disappeared during my normal daily use. The Panasonic support people were little help. They acknowledged that the problem is a ""known issue"" to Panasonic. But all he did was say I should send it to their McAllenTexas repair center. I was given no info on whether the problem was correctable how long I would have to do without my camera or any assurance that the same problem wouldn't recur even if they ""fixed"" it or gave me a new camera. If you get a ZS50 with this problem you can determine what mode you are in by looking at the monitor screen but you will no longer just be able to look at the mode dial to see what setting you are in. By the way it's a good camera.",0

The camera fit all my needs; small size wide angle lens and AA batteries but I am so frustrated with the inconsistencies and issues with it I want to throw it in the trash! First it does not have a setting to force the flash which I need all the time to take interior photos of homes (real estate appraiser). Either the flash will not flash and/or if I adjust the light exposure the pics are either way too dark or way too light. Several times they have been just solid black or solid white. I have wasted hours on end trying to get it adjusted and when it is finally right (at the moment) it reverts back to the default as soon as its turned off & back on.  Very unhappy!,0

I am a building / home inspector and as such (recently did the math) I take upwards of 500 - 600 photos a week for my inspection reports that people rely on to purchase perhaps the biggest purchase of their lives - their home.  I bought this camera in February of 2015 (14 months ago) and after ~33000 photos my beloved DSC-W380 has finally met its match by way of a lens booger.NOW let me get to the point.  Being the centerpiece of my livelihood and the tool that has captured more construction sites floor decking landscaping electrical components low lighting conditions of every kind frost rain (and yes even falling off a building... action shot ; )) I was troubled when its tiny little heart gave up on me (natural death).  Since then I have tried virtually every Point and Shoot on the market $200 and under $200 and over Sony Nikon Canon done side by sides swam in camera specs that would make any sane person's head spin and have come to one resolute conclusion...  If you are in the inspection business and need an amazing quality image on the quick this is it.I'm not selling cameras here so let me get back to my letter.  SONY... PLEASE PLEASE... DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS CAMERA.  It is the perfect marriage of low light taking no nonsense perfect design for working professional (love the thumb zoom... can and will never zoom with my index finger... thumb on zoom trigger finger on trigger... amen) perfect optics aluminum non-plastic tough as nails shell perfect amount of zoom... I could go on.  This is a timeless camera for a no-nonsense user and should NEVER be discontinued.Thank you Sony for the genesis of this camera and your attention to this open letter I would guess I'm speaking for a large swath of real estate inspectors everywhere.  Phenomenal camera just repurchased after at least 30 hours of research hands-on experimentation etc (03/16)...I will not buy anything other than the DSC-W830 for my main work camera.Kind Regards,0

We had some enlarged and the quality of the photographs is excellent. This is a excellent camera that you can carry in you pocket and have ready in seconds. We bought a spare battery as she takes a lot of pictures. That worked well as we needed it. If you don't take a lot of pictures one battery will certainly work. We recharged both batteries every night and were ready to go every morning. When all is said and done - the pictures are what remains to remind you of those special moments. And this camera takes great pictures. This is the second Sony camera of this size we have purchased. I got her old one and it still works well - but this one is better!,0

I had previous good experience with Sony's CyberShot model line and Carl Zeiss lenses and that's why I bought this to replace my 9-years old Canon PowerShot A400. To my disappointment not this time!I took the same frame with this camera and my old Canon that I must have put at least 10000 shots on compensating for the difference in focal depth by stepping backward for a mere 5-6 feet (the Sony has a wider viewing angle than my poor old Canon). On the surface both shots looked ok. On 1:1 scale the details and edges are completely smudged and lost with this Sony. The tired lens of my 9-years old Canon was able to produce a crisper shot overall and captured more fine details of near and far objects in the frame. Mind you I had both shots set at the same ISO and light conditions. I have uploaded and noted the pictures of the 2 cameras for everyone to see. The should by under Customer Images page http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00HNJWUBI/ref=cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdrThen I thought about the difference in Megapixels. The Canon is an old 3.2 MP this one is 20.1 MP. I'm guessing that the Sony's processor is unable to utilize all these pixels efficiently in the time the camera takes to shoot the image. My experience with older DSC CyberShots have been amazing. But this was also around the time when 4 megapixels was considered high-end for point-n-shoot cameras. So this is all speculation. But the bottom line remains: A new camera is unable to produce a crisp clear fine detailed image as a 9-years old one with 1/6th the megapixel power and outdated processing technology.I still love an value Carl Zeiss optics. In fact I own several interchangeable lenses from this company and they are superb in every aspect. I just don't understand how Sony managed to smudge this lens's reputation so badly by installing it in this particular model.Another possibility is that this particular camera was a lemon but I don't have the time or energy to order a replacement just to verify that it was actually this particular piece and not the entire DSCW830 line.Thankfully it only took me 3 days of testing to make up my mind and decide that I'm not interested in paying for a new camera that gives out pictures that are worse than the one I'm trying to replace. I already started the return/refund process with Amazon and shipped it back yesterday! 5 Stars to Amazon though for their return/refund policies.,1

Good For Video  Pictures Mostly Blurry & Battery Stinks (READ)  August 11  2016By Twinpossible,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,***UPDATE AFTER MANY MONTHS OF USE***- For my videos this is an OK camera but it dies SUPER fast. You need like 3 extra batteries on hand if say going out for a day trip No other camera I have had (about 20 of them in my life) has died this fast. The pictures are rough. I would say 3 out of 5 are blurry. I have to take numerous photos to get any that aren't the least bit fuzzy. It might be closer to 4 out of 5. Sometimes it's minor and you don't notice w/o zooming in. I didn't realize that problem very fast because I use it more for YT videos than anything else. Also the shutter speed for photos is rather slow but it's a cheap camera so that isn't too abnormal there.The pros to this camera are that it is small light-weight and films video in the 16:9 widescreen I need for my online videos. IF I could turn back time I would have returned this camera and bought something a little bit pricier and better all around. Oh well. Hopefully I get a better one from Santa Claus :)!!I love this camera so far as far as what I bought it for my You Tube videos and other stuff. I only used it one full day but the battery STINKS!! My other cameras last 5x's or more longer. Did I get a bum battery???? I charge it fully and take video and it starts going down to one bar and done FAR too fast to be normal. I read reviews that said it lasted people through many flash photos and videos during the day. I'm wondering if this is a camera I can take out for a day trip or not. My husband thinks maybe I got a bad battery. Anybody have any issues??? I love that it doesn't change the lighting to an orangey color which is what the problem was with my more expensive larger cameras. It's all over the place with those which makes editing sooo difficult. This seems to stay true and the video quality is very good. I wanted a 1080 but I cannot tell the difference to be honest. This is worth the $$ in the quality dept. & it is a Sony. I haven't taken photos yet. I'm just concerned about the battery. If the battery gets replaced and lasts a lot longer than I will give this a better review. PS- The size is great but very tiny compared to my old point and shoot. In a crazy house like mine it may not last the year lol. All is good but the battery. I'm thinking that may be a defect.,0

Nope it is really a 5-sec delay between photos  I invested not only in this camera but and extra battery and battery charger.

March 5  2016By Skullywag,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"From a day one aspect it does what it is supposed to do.  This is my 3rd Canon ELPH previous models being the 110 HS and 330 HS.No discernable difference in picture quality when compared to my 330.Zoom has greatly improved and has a bit better image stabilization vs the 330.  MP4 has replaced the aged MOV format for videos.I am NOT a camera techie and don't use half the features on this camera but know a good picture when I see one and one of the main things that impress me with the ELPH line is how great pictures and videos look when displayed on a large screen TV.  That's the test for me... I've purchased other models that failed and were returned.It's true that today many cellphones take WONDERFULL pictures and vids but you are NOT going find  the kind of zoom that point and shoots have.  When on vacation I'd have to say 50% of my pictures involve the use of the zoom lens.  Actual cameras are still relevant in today's cellphone centric world (at least for the time being).The REAL reason I upgraded this go around (my 330 is in excellent working condition) was that Canon FINALLY made MP4 the format for the 360's videos.  Although previous versions took wonderful HD videos you have no idea how frustrating it is to transfer a video to your phone and having to convert it from MOV format first!  Converting formats always involves a loss of quality and I never understood why an Apple format had to be standard on a non-Apple device. MOV is an age old format and MP4 beats it hands down and is playable on almost any PC or Android device.Nit-picking... this model has a flimsier battery/card door and using the Wi-Fi feature I had to use ""manual"" steps to do so as the ""auto"" feature would recognize the device but not connect.... not a big thing but would be nice if it would connect to devices as easily as cellphones do these days.Over all I'm quite happy with the camera and feel the ELPH series offer the best pictures and smallest size in the compact point and shoot category. If it didn't....I wouldn't be on my third model of the line.  My first ELPH (110HS) is still working wonderfully 5 yrs later the only reason I upgrade is for the improved features .  I can't recommend this camera highly enough...it's GREAT.A piece of good advice is when buying a case...look for a hard/semi hard ""clamshell"" type case.  My ELPHs look and act pristine after years of use because they are well protected when being carried or not in use.  Pouch style cases won't protect your camera from bumps or accidental drops which I have encountered many times and have had no ill effects due to the clam shell cases superior protection.Update 4-24-16Just got back from a Vegas trip where this camera was use extensively.  I had nose bleed seats at the T-Mobile Arena Guns n Roses concert.  My 1080p cellphone camera could not capture stage action as the low light filter does not work in zoom mode (all it could capture at full zoom was a blurry mess).  Was able to get video with my HS 360 in zoom mode clear enough to actually capture facial expressions....GREAT video from some of the worst seats in a 40000 seat arena. How can you beat that from an ultra compact point and shoot?  When filming in full HD I was getting about 45 mins a battery (I took 2 extra).  Low light ability is A LOT better than my Note 4's camera.  In DAYLIGHT....my cellphone takes excellent pictures and video....at NIGHT....not so much.  Glad I had this camera with me.If you are taking pictures expect to get 300+ to a battery charge....video around 45-60 mins.  Extra batteries are cheap and quite fast to change out when filming extensively....well worth the money.",1

I am not a professional photographer but my main camera is a Cannon EOS Rebel T3 Canon EOS Rebel T3 Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (discontinued by manufacturer). I also have not fully read the instruction booklet yet either.Pros:--------------1) Small & Light Weight: One of my co-workers tossed the box holding the camera to me and didn’t think there was a camera inside of it.2) Great Distance view: I will get a series of photographs I took during my lunch break from our back door. We are 0.7 miles from the cranes in the picture. I was able to get a good enough distance picture to read the manufacturers. I am not sure if I can do that on my Rebel T3 with just the normal lens.3) Filter Settings: I have not gone through all the settings yet. However there is a setting where the camera will take 3+ pictures and change the filter automatically. I just took a picture of the texture on the ceiling to test this and it was pretty neat.Cons:------------------1) The first thing I noticed while taking pictures outside is that it is hard to see what you are shooting in the display screen. I tried taking pictures in the shade and direct sun and in both instances I really had to struggle to see.2) Close up images: I tried using this vs the camera in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone to take pictures of my Beta Fish tank at work. I found that out of 8 attempted shots only 2 came out non-blurry while using the cannon. I have purchased the same SD card that I would use for my Rebel T3 so that should not cause the delay .Overall so far I am happy. I am marking it at 4 for now but mattering how things change once I read the directions it might be lowered. If I am spending $200 on a camera I want it to work outside. I wanted this camera to ride in my purse on the go since I don’t always want to carry the bulky DSLR. SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB UHS-I/U3 SDHC Flash Memory Card with up to 95MB/s- SDSDXPA-032G-AFFP,1

May 23  2016By TamiP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Best camera I've ever owned! Does a great job on pictures though I'm no photographer. I really like the picture quality but this little thing shines on the video end. Nice and crisp videos and with the picture stabilization it is wonderful.I'm still learning about it so haven't gone through all the paces. Last camera I had was a Sony cybershot and I always hated it. Took forever for the shutter to engage after I pushed the button and I missed shots all the time. This takes the picture when I want to not when it wants to.Best part by far is the true point and shoot set up. I don't understand all the technical stuff and wanted something I could point and shoot period.,0

January 29  2017By Jaz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought a Cannon ELPH well over 10 years ago and used it all the time. In the last year I started having some problems with it and because I loved it so much I purchased this one. The first thing I noticed is the craftsmanship of this camera. While it is significantly lighter and thinner than my first camera it is not made as well. The battery door is made so flimsy when I go to open it I'm afraid it will break off. Also the latch to keep the battery in place is cheaply made. The settings are time consuming to find what you want or need. And if you are an amateur photographer like me and want to learn how to use the settings you have to download the over 300 page manual. This is not convenient to be out taking pictures and have to drag a computer with you to read the manual. Whatever happened to getting the manual with the product? I just received this camera this month so haven't really had a chance to play yet. I did take some pictures both inside and outside and so far not overly impressed. Maybe once I learn all the settings and how to get to them I will change my mind. So far the verdict is this will be the last ELPH I will be purchasing!,0

February 8  2017By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After taking two photos with new batteries the camera would show the  batteries as being dead and would turn off.  Taking out the batteries and putting them back in you could take two more photos before it died again but the previous ones would be lost.  The product description said it could use a sd memory card.  No truth in that.  Called the consumer care center which was a disconnected number.  I went to the website of Polaroid.com and after being referred to two more numbers finally got a  person who said the product had been long ago discontinued by Polaroid.  I will be returning it.,0

Yes it goes through batteries very quickly but we just turn off the flash most of the time and they last a little longer.  The quality is actually not bad but it's perfect for a child that is just learning and having his own camera.  The pictures are easy to upload to the computer as well.  And if he drops it or scratches it at least it wasn't extremely expensive either.  It's great for a first time camera.  The only thing I was disappointed in is the description stated  ""Snap and store up to 120 images using the 8MB of built-in memory or insert a SD/SDHC card to expand its memory capabilities and snap many more pictures.""  Well because I was basing it off that I didn't buy the memory card.  After receiving the camera it was clear that I HAD to have the memory card because the camera wouldn't work without it.  Granted the memory card was like $5-$6 but it's the whole point.  Don't have it in the description if it's not true.  All in all I'm pretty happy with it.  More importantly my son loves it!",0

The camera looks nice it came with all the accesories batteries and even the original box. I unpacked it and tried some pictures which came out very clear. I was just happy with my product until... 5 minutes later the screen froze and started showing lines accross the image. When I tried to turn it off the buttons would not respond anymore. I had to remove the batteries to reset the camera hoping it was just a one time glitch but unfortunately it kept on doing the same freezing problem over and over. I was just really hoping the problem would go away because I wanted to keep the product but it will have to be returned.I don't think I will be able to get another one as cheap as this one. i have the feeling that I just got a bad apple.I will keep on looking for a working camera again.Edit: As it turned out I was able to get the same deal with the same vendor. I just for the new camera today and it works great. The pictures are crystal clear the camera is very easy to handle and it does not feel cheap at all. So far so good. Another interesting fact is that I returned the defective ítem today and I was just notified that I got the money back even before they got it. That is great customer service and I will gladly bump up my review to 5 stars both for the product and the service.Edit2: After using the camera over the holidays it seems to me that the pictures taken are not as sharp as those that I have been taking with my LG4 telephone. It probably needs a little getting used to but I have not been able to get a decent picture that I really like. I am using it @ 15 MP with the auto mode. I have only used it with interior pictures at night. I am waiting to take some pictures on panorama mode at a landscape. Probably it will work better that way. Still waiting for the perfect picture.,0

This camera did the job beautifully! I can't believe it. When I was taking pictures of the doll art I was working on the pictures were so detailed that I had to lotion my hands really well because the camera showed how dry my hands were. I love that this camera!!! The camera looks traditional and professional but I know looks aren't everything.  What was included with the camera are batteries a USB cord which works really well with my MacBook Air.  It used my iPhoto as the way to down pictures.  It also included a strap and projective cap over the lense. You'll need to by a SDHC memory card. The camera has a nice heft to it But even with that weight  I can still take a picture with one hand while trying to take photos of what I'm working on.  I am an amateur at cameras but I know what I wanted my pictures to look like and this camera did that for me!  Just fantastic.,1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01CQEN2U2,Sony DSCHX80/B High Zoom Point & Shoot…,        137 of 142 people found the following review helpful       One of the best 1/2.3 sensor point & shoot!  June 19  2016By S.C. Dallas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is my fourth Sony product after my purchase of Sony a7s RX100 and RX100III (wife's cam).  I currently also have the Lumix GH4 as I like to take videos as much as photos.  I bought the HX80 as a gift for my niece.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't quite need the prosumer 1"" sensor point and shoot or who wants the extra zoom capabilities that the larger sensors can't pack in such a small form.  I will work backwards and start with the cons then the pros.Cons:*  Smaller 1/2.3 sensor as opposed to 1"" sensor (then again price is reflective of smaller sensor and the 1/2.3 sensor on the HX80 is back illuminated which makes it much nicer than other comparable sensors)*  No 4k video*  No manual zoom*  No touchscreenPros:*  Pop up viewfinder*  Flash that's semi-tiltable*  Quick menu with 12 customizable functions*  Full PASM modes for manual and semi-manual controls plus full auto modes if that's the preference*  Monitor that tilts 180 degrees for selfies*  30X zoom fantastic for travelers*  High quality XAVC S video format up to 50mbps at 24p 30p and 60p (requires SDXC memory cards)*  PASM modes all available for video*  Video manual mode has auto-iso option (not all cameras allow video auto-iso in manual; i.e. the much more expensive RX100 doesn't have this option)*  5-AXIS image stabilizer works great*  WIFI/NFC included plus downloadable appsThere are many more features that I could go on about this neat little point and shoot just check out the spec sheets.  At this price level especially for those that like to shoot both photos and videos the Sony HX80 in my opinion is one of the best 1/2.3 sensor pocket cameras.  I hope you find this review helpful!",0

Amazing! Sony has done it again. Before this pocket camera I would use my iPhone in situations where I did not want carry or shoot a larger camera.  Of course in low light the iPhone photos weren't great particularly when I tried to zoom in in the subject such as a Congressman at a political celebration.  With this camera I was able to get long zooms in low light that came out surprisingly well.  It's never going to match a long zoom full format camera but those are 4 to 5 times the size of this camera.  This camera is a real winner and makes taking a great camera with you anywhere so much easier.,0

Only complaint so far while shooting it's very easy to 'bump' a button on the back and change a setting especially if wearing gloves.  Maybe there's a way to disable these buttons but I have not found it so far.  Otherwise a very good deal especially for the price.,0

I am a building / home inspector and as such (recently did the math) I take upwards of 500 - 600 photos a week for my inspection reports that people rely on to purchase perhaps the biggest purchase of their lives - their home.  I bought this camera in February of 2015 (14 months ago) and after ~33000 photos my beloved DSC-W380 has finally met its match by way of a lens booger.NOW let me get to the point.  Being the centerpiece of my livelihood and the tool that has captured more construction sites floor decking landscaping electrical components low lighting conditions of every kind frost rain (and yes even falling off a building... action shot ; )) I was troubled when its tiny little heart gave up on me (natural death).  Since then I have tried virtually every Point and Shoot on the market $200 and under $200 and over Sony Nikon Canon done side by sides swam in camera specs that would make any sane person's head spin and have come to one resolute conclusion...  If you are in the inspection business and need an amazing quality image on the quick this is it.I'm not selling cameras here so let me get back to my letter.  SONY... PLEASE PLEASE... DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS CAMERA.  It is the perfect marriage of low light taking no nonsense perfect design for working professional (love the thumb zoom... can and will never zoom with my index finger... thumb on zoom trigger finger on trigger... amen) perfect optics aluminum non-plastic tough as nails shell perfect amount of zoom... I could go on.  This is a timeless camera for a no-nonsense user and should NEVER be discontinued.Thank you Sony for the genesis of this camera and your attention to this open letter I would guess I'm speaking for a large swath of real estate inspectors everywhere.  Phenomenal camera just repurchased after at least 30 hours of research hands-on experimentation etc (03/16)...I will not buy anything other than the DSC-W830 for my main work camera.Kind Regards,0

August 27  2014By Randall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought this camera for my wife for our vacation to Utah. She took hundreds of great pictures. We had some enlarged and the quality of the photographs is excellent. This is a excellent camera that you can carry in you pocket and have ready in seconds. We bought a spare battery as she takes a lot of pictures. That worked well as we needed it. If you don't take a lot of pictures one battery will certainly work. We recharged both batteries every night and were ready to go every morning. When all is said and done - the pictures are what remains to remind you of those special moments. And this camera takes great pictures. This is the second Sony camera of this size we have purchased. I got her old one and it still works well - but this one is better!,0

I was going to delete my comments about my first order but I think it's important to know how Amazon responds when something isn't just right and I appreciated the help. Great videos great photos! Buy this camera!I love this camera (have an older version) but I have a concern about the condition. It came with photos I didn't take on the internal memory. I'm not sure if this is a reconditioned camera and I'm not sure how to contact Amazon about that.  It also didn't come with a wrist strap (as advertised.)Pros: The lens is awesome. It takes great photos and great videos. Great resolution.Cons: The flash isn't great but I don't expect a huge flash for a point and shoot. The door to the battery is a little flimsy (again I knew what I was ordering.)It's a great camera and takes great photos. My only concern is why someone else's photos are on this camera!,0

I had previous good experience with Sony's CyberShot model line and Carl Zeiss lenses and that's why I bought this to replace my 9-years old Canon PowerShot A400. To my disappointment not this time!I took the same frame with this camera and my old Canon that I must have put at least 10000 shots on compensating for the difference in focal depth by stepping backward for a mere 5-6 feet (the Sony has a wider viewing angle than my poor old Canon). On the surface both shots looked ok. On 1:1 scale the details and edges are completely smudged and lost with this Sony. The tired lens of my 9-years old Canon was able to produce a crisper shot overall and captured more fine details of near and far objects in the frame. Mind you I had both shots set at the same ISO and light conditions. I have uploaded and noted the pictures of the 2 cameras for everyone to see. The should by under Customer Images page http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B00HNJWUBI/ref=cm_cmu_up_thanks_hdrThen I thought about the difference in Megapixels. The Canon is an old 3.2 MP this one is 20.1 MP. I'm guessing that the Sony's processor is unable to utilize all these pixels efficiently in the time the camera takes to shoot the image. My experience with older DSC CyberShots have been amazing. But this was also around the time when 4 megapixels was considered high-end for point-n-shoot cameras. So this is all speculation. But the bottom line remains: A new camera is unable to produce a crisp clear fine detailed image as a 9-years old one with 1/6th the megapixel power and outdated processing technology.I still love an value Carl Zeiss optics. In fact I own several interchangeable lenses from this company and they are superb in every aspect. I just don't understand how Sony managed to smudge this lens's reputation so badly by installing it in this particular model.Another possibility is that this particular camera was a lemon but I don't have the time or energy to order a replacement just to verify that it was actually this particular piece and not the entire DSCW830 line.Thankfully it only took me 3 days of testing to make up my mind and decide that I'm not interested in paying for a new camera that gives out pictures that are worse than the one I'm trying to replace. I already started the return/refund process with Amazon and shipped it back yesterday! 5 Stars to Amazon though for their return/refund policies.,1

Good For Video  Pictures Mostly Blurry & Battery Stinks (READ)  August 11  2016By Twinpossible,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,***UPDATE AFTER MANY MONTHS OF USE***- For my videos this is an OK camera but it dies SUPER fast. You need like 3 extra batteries on hand if say going out for a day trip No other camera I have had (about 20 of them in my life) has died this fast. The pictures are rough. I would say 3 out of 5 are blurry. I have to take numerous photos to get any that aren't the least bit fuzzy. It might be closer to 4 out of 5. Sometimes it's minor and you don't notice w/o zooming in. I didn't realize that problem very fast because I use it more for YT videos than anything else. Also the shutter speed for photos is rather slow but it's a cheap camera so that isn't too abnormal there.The pros to this camera are that it is small light-weight and films video in the 16:9 widescreen I need for my online videos. IF I could turn back time I would have returned this camera and bought something a little bit pricier and better all around. Oh well. Hopefully I get a better one from Santa Claus :)!!I love this camera so far as far as what I bought it for my You Tube videos and other stuff. I only used it one full day but the battery STINKS!! My other cameras last 5x's or more longer. Did I get a bum battery???? I charge it fully and take video and it starts going down to one bar and done FAR too fast to be normal. I read reviews that said it lasted people through many flash photos and videos during the day. I'm wondering if this is a camera I can take out for a day trip or not. My husband thinks maybe I got a bad battery. Anybody have any issues??? I love that it doesn't change the lighting to an orangey color which is what the problem was with my more expensive larger cameras. It's all over the place with those which makes editing sooo difficult. This seems to stay true and the video quality is very good. I wanted a 1080 but I cannot tell the difference to be honest. This is worth the $$ in the quality dept. & it is a Sony. I haven't taken photos yet. I'm just concerned about the battery. If the battery gets replaced and lasts a lot longer than I will give this a better review. PS- The size is great but very tiny compared to my old point and shoot. In a crazy house like mine it may not last the year lol. All is good but the battery. I'm thinking that may be a defect.,0

Nope it is really a 5-sec delay between photos  I invested not only in this camera but and extra battery and battery charger.

The camera held up against everything we threw at it including my 9 and 5 year old kids =)The pictures we got off the camera were actually surprisingly awesome. In daytime light the pictures are great. In the water things also were better than expected. Lower light situations the camera seemed to struggle a bit but that might be to be expected for a camera in this price range.One feature I like playing with is the time lapse feature. It's pretty interesting to set up an interesting scene and let it capture for a while and then see what you get in the end.,0

The selfie mode took a while to get use to but went on a trip recently and used it quit a bit and the extra wide screen helps capture more in the background. Indoor shots are average at best. One note don't leave the battery compartment door open for long periods. Humidity can get into the camera that way and cause fogging in the lens compartment.

Composite shooting with non-moving subjects works great inside but don't plan on using that on people. Seems well built but I can hear a slight rattling from within the camera's body. Not concerned about that but this thing is supposed to survive a 6-foot drop. Powers on VERY quickly has integrated GPS and the wi-fi functionality is dead simple. If Olympus would just upgrade the optics this would be an amazing camera. As-is it's a very portable weatherproof camera that will take acceptable pictures in sunlight.

But let me back up first...I had a previous ELPH that was working fine for a few years but I started noticing cataracts in my pictures.  Examining the lens I noticed that the lens was scratched in the middle from what I assume was the lens cover opening and closing several times over the years.  Maybe it was my fault for carrying it around in my pocket throughout the years maybe it's Canon's fault...I don't know but it did force me to get a new camera the ELPH 170.Size - I specifically like this camera for what it is - a small but powerful camera.  I have an SLR but to be honest it sits in the closet for the most part.  I don't want to be on vacation at a family event like a wedding or out with friends and have a big clunky camera.My brother once asked me when seeing me with my ELPH ""Who still carries a separate camera when everyone has one on their phone?""  Well my answer to him was that phone cameras are great for their size but really as cameras they're not the greatest.  And this is why I like this size of camera.  It fits in a pocket and it takes excellent pictures.  12x zoom...dedicated camera...you'll get much better pictures than anyone else who is taking them with their phone and then you can simply stick it back in your pocket again.As far as specs you can compare them yourself but for me I remember the days of film and the early days of digital cameras.  The pictures I'm able to take today on a cheap camera with image stabilization and high resolution amaze me when I think of the past...but then I digress.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think you can go wrong buying a Canon or Nikon today but size is of importance to me and the size of this camera fits a nice balance between power and size.",0

The main thing that convinced me to buy it was the 12x zoom. One thing about it however really annoys me: It's impossible to turn off the digital zoom when shooting in fully automatic mode. Apparently it can only be turned off in program mode. Watching the zoom indicator while framing a shot is distracting but when zooming in the fully auto mode I have to; otherwise it will zip right past the 12x optical limit & into the digital zoom range up to 48x (!) without so much as a ""by-your-leave."" I HATE digital zoom! I'm undecided whether or not that's a deal-breaker. I may keep the camera & always shoot in program mode or I may return it. Camera makers know that digital zoom is a useless gimmick! Why do they do things like this to their customers?",0

We recently went on a two trip to Europe.  I was looking for a small camera which could take good quality pictures and was more convenient than lugging around my DSLR.  Boy did I find it!  Quality of images is superb.  Color reproduction couldn't be better.  The camera's ability to handle difficult lighting situations is phenomenal.  It focuses quickly in any lighting situation in which I used it including low light.  Because of its small size and versatility I was able to capture many great images on the fly that I would not have been able to get with my larger camera.  I could not be more pleased and highly recommend this camera to anyone!,1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00RKNNA1G,Canon PowerShot ELPH 170 IS (Blue),        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Good camera for the novice.  December 21  2015By R. Thomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought the ELPH 170 IS to replace an old Powershot A470 that started having some issues.The positives: It's small & easy to carry. It's easy to use especially if you've owned a Canon camera previously. The LCD screen is adequate (the exact same size as the one on my old A470). It's not overly complicated to use if you're not a camera expert just put it on AUTO point & shoot. Maximum resolution pictures so far seem to be OK quality wise but take up a fair amount of space so buy an adequate SD card. No flash images are much better quality than my old A470. The flash is better as well it has a longer range than my old camera.The negatives: It doesn't come with any onboard storage for images. It doesn't come with a user guide. A manual is downloadable from Canon but that's up there with kissing your sister. It uses an uncommon battery (in the sense that you can't go into a convenience store & by batteries if yours fails). One strong point of my old A470 was that it uses AA batteries that you can get everywhere. Because it uses a special battery I had to buy an extra to always have a charged battery available. Not supplying onboard memory and using a special battery adds to the cost of the camera.Conclusion: The camera is easy to use does a good job. When you guy an SD card don't go too large unless you're going to take a LOT of pictures or do a lot of video. I had a spare 16GB SD card in desk and it's got space for literally thousands of max resolutions images. A 2GB card would probably be plenty for most people. If you're looking for an easy to use camera that takes good pictures this one will probably do you just fine. If you're a professional photographer and want to control every aspect of the shooting experience this likely isn't the camera for you.,0

The images are clear with little distortion except in very low light (most cameras have this problem - nothing unusual there and still better than our last pocket camera). The optical zoom works well. A big step up from most phone cameras. The controls are relatively easy to access and it is lightweight small.

It just feels cheap to hold. The retractable lens cover rattles doesn't close completely and is very loose. Picture quality was okay. I expected better from Canon. I sent it to Canon for repairs which they said they won't do on this model. I had to pay to ship it to them for a replacement camera (albeit at a reduced price) and to have it shipped back to me.,0

The zoom is incredible contrast is great and every picture feels very alive. Video quality is 10/10 and everything moves at a rapid pace for the on-the-go traveler. The menu functions have been elaborated a bit just enough to give a bit more control to the user without being overbearing.Admittedly there is a bit of grainyness when shooting darker scenes and audio can sometimes be muffled at concerts and whatnot. Somehow even my $150 smartphone is better at capturing audio and shows than this thing which is a big part of my personal life.,0

September 13  2016By Michael T Kennedy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A very nice and small point and shoot camera. We took this to Alaska two weeks ago and used it extensively to photograph animals in Denali Park. The zoom feature worked very well. The only limitation using the zoom is that the image on the viewfinder is so small that I did not know if I got the images I wanted until we got back to the lodge and I loaded the memory card into my laptop. Then we could see the full image magnified and could edit or delete those we did not want to keep. I have other larger cameras and chose not to take them as they are bulky. This little camera fits in a pocket. I gave my big digital SLR camera to my daughter as it was a pain to carry on a trip. Others with us in the park had elaborate equipment and several commented favorably on my images when seeing them on the laptop. It is a good choice forma trip unless you want superzoom capability and are willing to put up with the equipment. The battery life is also excellent. I have taken trips in the past with teenagers who were always having to recharge batteries. I did not recharge this one at all.,1

Romero,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The size is just right. for portability.  I have many Power Shot Cameras that are excellent and better than the ELPH 170 IS.  The feature that I like best about the 170 IS model is its macro mode for close-ups of flowers etc.  It is small and light which I can carry with me all the time.  The photo that you preview on the view finder is not as good as the image that is down-loaded in a computer. It is very economical at $139.  I recommend this camera to anyone who has the need for the above features.,1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00K7O2DJU,Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital…,        965 of 986 people found the following review helpful       An improved RX100M  June 20  2014By Richard Enthusiast: Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,(Update Dec 6th 2014)I highly recommend this book for the RX100M3 by Gary Friedman.  I bought it and love it ([...])I bought this camera because of its faster lens (f/1.8 to f2.8) which means to me more light entering onto the cameras sensor which in turn means to me slightly better images than previous models. Which translate to a shallower depth of field available. And that's exactly what I like and want in this model and precisely why I bought it even though I also have the previous M2 model. One thing I want to note here before I go on. The Aperture seems to move quite fast from 1.8 to 2.8 thru the smaller zoom range. In that a case could be made that this lens is more of a steady 2.8 thru out the zoom range.So then what exactly did I get with this upgrade from my M2 to my new M3? Well you've got the newer Bionz X processer. The new 180 degree LCD (for Selfies if you are so inclined). The pop-up EVF (which is an innovation in and of itself and a help with image stabilization when pressed against my face). Zebra pattern and focus peaking which is available on my RX10 and now the M3.I feel the 24mm-70mm lens (though not the same reach as my previous M2 model - 28-100mm) is a good walk-around lens. And since I have been using this same zoom range for a long time on my DSLRs I feel very comfortable with this zoom range in a very capable and now compact camera. When I use this for portraits at the long end of 70mm I expect to shoot mostly 1/2 to 3/4 body shots to full body shots. As opposed to the previous models zoom range of 28-100mm where I used it up to head and shoulder shots at the long end.This camera has the same Bionz X processor that Sony has in their A7 line of cameras (one of which the A7R that I have). That was another plus for me in buying this camera. As far as image stabilization it is important to compact cameras today and thus to me. And I find that holding the camera up to my face while using the EVF gives me the 'feel' of a more stabilized shot. And my pictures look better to me. This is important to me because now that I am in my 60's try as I might holding the M2 or my smartphone without an EVF - is not as steady as I'd like it to be or as I remember it was when I was younger. And I need image stabilization in lower light. And this EVF on my new compact M3 seems to provide that for me. The only 'unofficial' (perhaps non-technical) test I could do with this camera was to zoom it out to 70mm and hold the shutter half-way to see how much 'lock' I had on the image. Then I tried it with my M2. My observation was that I did see an improved difference with the M3.There is a slight difference in camera size from the previous model (which I also have). The thickness of this model is about 2mm more. And the weight is about 8 to 9 grams more. What this also means in terms of fitting a leather case to it is that my previous models Sony leather case will not fit this camera. You're going to need the Sony LCJRXF/B Premium Jacket Case (Black). This new case will fit all previous models as well as this model. Just as the Sony LCJRXC/B Premium Jacket Case (Black) would only fit the M2 as well as the M1. Some people think that the case for the M2 will also fit the M3. It will not. I have tried it. I also recommend the custom camera grip by Richard Franiec (camera accessories by Richard Franiec). This goes for about 35$ and is worth its weight in gold - to me. It is far better than the Sony grip that I used on the M2 for 15$. Its made of metal (anodized aluminium) is sleek looking feels good quality and solid and gives you a good grip on the camera while still maintaining the cameras pocketability (because it doesn't protrude past the lens assembly). Of course with the camera grip added the M3 will not fit in the Sony Leather camera case. So it is either one or the other. So to get around this I ordered another OP/TECH USA Soft Pouch Digital D-Micro (Black) for my M3 which I also have for the M2. And it fits great.If my review was any help with your decision to purchase and I hope I was of some help kindly choose 'Yes' in the comments section below. Thank You. Richard,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00K7O2DJU,Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital…,        313 of 325 people found the following review helpful       A Very Nice Upgrade from Sony - Update 6/22/14  June 20  2014By Walt Kurtz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought the RX100 in its original configuration a few years ago when it first came out. I liked the camera from the outset and have taken more than a few pictures with it that I am really happy with. It is my choice for backing up my Nikon D4 or D800 when I can't deal with taking along two large DSLRs. I took a look at DXO mark and they rate the sensor the same as the sensor for my old D200 which may sound like damning with faint praise but the D200 was a workhorse and shot a lot of great stuff. I will say at the outset that I like the M3 a lot. I am happy I upgraded from the original but I think that if you have the M2 you may not need this update. The faster lens is a noticeable improvement. Indoor shots without flash at reasonable ISO's are much more feasible now.Updated 6/24/14 - I thought I would add a comment about a statement from the dpreview piece on the M3. Dpreview praises the cameras abilities and then go on to say that it is not ""fun"" to shoot with. I guess an old SX-70 may have been more fun with all the whirring and spitting of prints but beyond that I am at a loss. I have had great creative session with both the M1 and M3. In fact one of my favorite things about the camera is that is so easy and transparent to handle.Pros:Articulating LCD - I think this is a huge improvement over the original RX100. The ability to easily shoot high or low angle pictures is a great advantage. I have always liked using compact cameras from the ant's eye view and this makes it a lot easier to do. Like most of the construction of the RX100m3 the articulating LCD feels well built but clearly this is not a ruggedized camera. Care must be taken with the flash EVF and LCD or damage could result. Things don't feel cheap they just don't feel ""battle ready""Picture Quality - I really like the output of the RX100M3. The pictures are sharp vivid and relatively free of noise at moderate ISO settings. One of the big improvements in the area of low light is the enhanced widest aperture of the lens. One can pixel peep any lens into a corner (no pun intended) but Sony has done a very respectable job here. I will discuss this more later but by going with a fast modest zoom with a nice wide end Sony has created a more enthusiast oriented camera. As Robert Capa said ""If your pictures aren't good enough you're not close enough.""Zoom - As mentioned above the zoom range is modest. I just really like the ability to use 24mm equivalent at the wide end. The zoom speed is quite good. Again I think it compares favorably to other high-end compacts that I have used.EVF - When I opened the EVF for the first time and look through it was terrible. Then I adjusted the diopter and it was beautiful. Seriously beautiful. This is my first EVF and I like it very much. I can see using it a great deal with this camera.Shutter - The shutters drops very quickly without any undue lag. I really like the burst mode on this camera with the shutter sounds turned off. It is a great way to get very natural candids of friends and family.Neutrals:Weight - The RX100M3 is noticeably heavier than the original. Noticeably but not significantly heavier. Yes when you pick it up you are just a touch more cognizant of gravities pull but nowhere near the point where you would leave on the table because it's too heavy to deal with. When carrying and using the camera the extra weight never crossed my mind.Size - Certainly related to weight but also a function of adding goodies like the EVF and articulating LCD. I wear a lot of clothes with big pockets and I have never been one to just stuff a compact camera in a pants pocket on an ongoing basis. I have a very small Lowepro belt case for my original RX100 and the new one fits perfectly even with an extra battery tucked inside. The size and weight differences are certainly discreet.Added 6/22/14 The current implementation of the Fn button is very nice. I really didn't use this button in the past but now it brings up a very clear easy to follow UI for the some of the most commonly accessed functions. I really like this feature.Added 6/22/14 I am growing very fond of the artificial horizon in the EVF. Despite 30+ years of photography I am still amazed how often in Lightroom I have to straighten the horizon. Maybe my head is just tilted. Whatever the cause the artificial horizon really helps and as a result I am not losing any of the frame having to rotate in post.Cons:Menus - While the menu system on the M3 is improved and certainly better than the old NEX software it could still use improvement. My biggest complaint has to do with navigating between menu categories and sub-menus. To me the UI manipulation is not intuitive but is certainly workable.Functions - Marketing people are wonderful and I know scene modes and scene recognition must be important to some segment of customers but I am not in that demographic. I suppose there is little harm in all the bells and whistles but it is very funny that Sony includes both an Automatic and Superior Automatic mode. When does one say ""I don't want the superior results let me kick this baby down to stinky normal Automatic mode.""Items on which the jury is still out.Wi-fi - I know there are people who can't wait for the favorite camera to come out with built in wi-fi so it can't be dismissed. I would only say that thus far my experience with the RX100M3's wi-fi functions have been cursory and I will amend this review when I am able to be more definitive about my experience.Would I recommend this camera?For a lot of people yes I would. If you are an enthusiast this is a credible compact contender. If you are an ultralight traveller who likes good photos this is also a good choice. If you are thinking of some for an adventure vacation with water snow sand or surf probably better to look at a ruggedized compact. Up until the RX100 all my compacts had been Canon's and they were great. I am happy with the move to Sony and believe I will be happy with the M3 for several years.",0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00K7O2DJU,Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital…,        316 of 342 people found the following review helpful       Good photos  but I would not recommend this camera or any Sony product after my experience.  Buy something else!  December 8  2014By ENX,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I was excited when I bought the new Sony RX100M3 Camera brand new from Amazon about 3 months ago.  I used it for a week on vacation and took about two thousand pictures. I have also used it for a couple day trips since then with no issue.  I turned it on last week and to prepare it for my Christmas trip format the SD cards and set some of the presets.  The camera powered on the lens extended but the rear screen would not display text or images.  Also all the buttons stopped working and it seemed to be stuck in movie mode regardless of the dial settings any button I pressed turned on and off record mode.At that point I checked Amazon online to see what the service policy was and where to go for support.  Amazon's site said to contact the manufacturer for questions and/or repair fair enough.  So I called Sony support.  The Sony tech asked me to try a couple things power off and on take the battery out and finally said it sounded like a firmware issue and told me to send the camera back.  He said that Sony would fix it under warranty.I sent the camera in.  A few days went by and Sony called me.  They told me that the camera has some corrosion inside on the circuit boards and said it was probably due to the humidity or moisture that may have entered the camera while in my use. I explained that I take very good care of tech gadgets and know for a fact that this camera was never exposed to any water or moisture.  Apparently corrosion is conveniently excluded from coverage under their warranty.  Anyway they told me that the repair of my camera is going to cost $225.  I could either accept the fee or they would send the broken camera back to me. What was I going to do with an $800 paperweight and I really wanted this camera for Christmas photos.  After trying to negotiate a more amicable solution with no success I agreed to the repair.This was an $800 ""TOP OF THE LINE"" Sony camera (plus case batteries and other accessories) that I used for one trip owned it for a total of 90 days and now I have to spend another $225 to have it fixed.  I checked online and found a lot of similar complaints about this corrosion issue with this camera and others are in same situation having to pay out of pocket for repair.  In my opinion here are the reasons this camera failed: inferior parts; poor construction; lack of quality control; and the body is not sealed from humidity.  I have gone back and forth with Sony customer support and keep hearing ""this is our policy"" and ""while we would like to help there is nothing we can do"".  I asked them to send me pictures of the corrosion which I have not received.  I can see me being charged if this was negligence on my part or if I had dropped the camera in the pool or ocean but this camera has been dry since day 1.  I don't expect every product to be perfect if Sony would just acknowledged the camera was faulty and fix it under warranty I would be happy.I have several other cameras Panasonic Canon and Nikon as well and iPhone iPad etc.  Most are less expensive than the RX100M3 and some more than 10 years old.  They are all still in top working condition except for the Sony RX100M3.Needless to say I am very disappointed in Sony!  The product quality and customer service are horrible!  At one time Sony was the go to company for high quality equipment and you didn't mind paying a little extra for it.  It's just not that high quality company anymore.  If Sony won’t stand behind the products they sell who will?There are far too many quality products on the market to waste your money on this overpriced junk.  It takes great pictures and has lots of features but in my opinion the costs are not worth the risks of getting one with a corrosion issue.This will definitely be my last Sony product!",0

But it has a design defect.  On some models (one I purchased and two I subsequently heard about) the lens cover sometimes does not fully retract when the camera powers up.  You don't know this happened unless you look very closely at the image on the screen.  This ruined several of my recent vacation photos.  I'm returning the camera I bought for a replacement in hopes of getting one without the defect.,1

It has never failed me.  I love the pop-up viewfinder which is a godsend in super-bright shooting.  The low-light performance beats my DSLR hands-down every time.  The camera feels solid in your hand despite its compact size and the majority-metal construction makes it a tough rugged device (even in my accident-prone hands!).  That Sony managed to pack all this power into such a compact size is still amazing to me but I am grateful every time I can slip the RX-100 into my pocket and leave my bulky (beloved) Nikon behind.  The Wi-Fi feature has also been a huge plus for me - I feel like I get a lot more out of the moment when I can share it with my friends and family rather than waiting a week or two for me to return home from a trip and download it from a memory card.There are limitations of course.  Mainly the field of view is not as wide as I would like for landscape shots the depth of field is insufficient for some artsy close-ups and the zoom is respectable but necessarily falls short of what you get with a telephoto lens.  I also routinely carry an extra battery because this little demon can run through a full battery in a few hours of continuous shooting.  Overall though this is a great camera for an advanced amateur photographer looking for a more compact option to supplement a steady DSLR habit and it's a particularly good choice for people who take a lot of low-light photos where this camera exceeds even the capabilities of some DSLRs.,1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00K7O2DJU,Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital…,        21 of 22 people found the following review helpful       Great super-small camera  but needs some add-ons to avoid dropping it.  September 21  2015By BGW,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"My DSC-RX100M3 arrived a few weeks ago but I've only a chance to take a few pictures with it.  It is amazingly compact which is what I wanted so that it fits in my pocket and thus more likely to be available when a shot comes up.  Years ago I gave up lugging a monster around my neck.I also wanted a fully articulating LCD screen so that one could protect it from scratches by folding it to face inward (like my old Canon which recently failed R.I.P.).  But alas this one only articulates upward 180º  and downwards 45º -- OK for selfies for shooting from over one's head in a crowd and for use on a tripod to copy documents-- but the screen remains vulnerably exposed in storage (I found a suitable pocket case for it and added cardboard to protect the screen when in pocket).I also hoped to replicate the AA battery size used by my old Canon so that I can buy replacements most anywhere when they go dead at just the wrong time. But again alas the DSC-RX100M3 uses a lithium one only rechargeable while in the camera (~230 minutes to full charge! according to the manual) unless one buys a separate charger.  The stock Sony charger that comes with the DSC-RX100M3 is basically just a not-very-powerful USB charger (output 5 volts at only 0.5 Amps) with no way to charge the battery directly. If plugged into the camera when it is turned on one gets a non-closeable error message that blocks the screen to warn that the charger is not strong enough to power the camera for shooting.So I bought a separate non-Sony charger of output 4.2 volts at 0.6 Amps (Amazon item B00UFQOBI6) that came with two compatible batteries with higher Ampere-hours rating than the stock Sony one.  The non-Sony charger also has convenient foldout parallel-blade prongs for 100-240-volt wall/mains charging plus a 12-volt-plug and cable for car charging.  The spare batteries have worked fine in the camera while the stock Sony one (NP-BX1) was being successfully charged out-of-camera in the non-OEM charger.The greatest feature of the DSC-RX100 series is its compact size but it has little real estate and smooth surfaces that are not conducive to grip it securely especially if one's hands are sweaty on a hot day.  The spot for one's thumb is particularly small.  To avoid dropping this close-to-US$800 item I bought and added some features to make a drop less likely.One accessory was a ""Skidproof Hand Grip For Sony RX100""  (Amazon item 111556506274) which is similar to a pricier Sony one.  But one has to be really careful to avoid airgaps if placing it too close to the lens because once it sticks even partially it's very hard to reposition.  I suggest testing the grip's position while temporarily keeping in place the peel-off strip that covers the strong 3M adhesive on its camera-contact side in order to see where it needs to be to get 100% contact with the flat and curvy camera front.But even the grip did not provide enough friction to protect this expensive little camera.  So I also bought 3M Safety-Walk® slip resistant tread (3M part number 7635 or 7635NA) which is sold to provide friction for stair and ladder treads and other potentially slippery surfaces.  I cut it with scissors and carefully applied it to all camera surfaces where fingers are likely to be gripping the camera but would not interfere with its function.  See uploaded photographs.  Given the 3-dimensionality of the grip cutting the tread in one piece that would cover all the grip's surfaces took some trial and error. But it would probably be fine to use separate pieces of the 3M tread tape for the grip.  The tiny thumb-hold spot also needed the increased friction of a piece of 3M tread if it is to be held securely.Now even with slippery sweaty hands I can grip the camera in various ways with less chance of dropping it.  I also added an REI cordlock so that the DSC-RX100M3's cord can be adjusted to fit snugly around my right wrist to allow sturdier access with forefinger to the top buttons.Finally as the the paper instructions booklet that comes with the camera is pretty basic I recommend downloading the full 214-page ""How to Use"" owner's manual from the Sony website.  This camera is like flying a 747 compared to the instrumentation and features of a Piper Cub so learning its features will be useful even if rarely or never used.  One can easily get into a menu dead-end without obvious way to back out.All in all a great camera.  But with both rechargeable lithium and non-rechargeable lithium batteries now available in standard AA battery format I sure wish some camera company would design a perhaps slightly larger camera to take them as well as a fully-articulating LCD screen that can have its business side folded inward when not needed.  Thus only 4 stars for this one.",1

Finally decided on the MKIII because while the extra features like the improved slowmo capabilities at up to 1000fps super fast shutter speed a 1/32000 an improved resolution EVF 4k video recording and generally improved image quality from the stacked CMOS sensor are fantastic they weren’t justified for intended use at the cost of $200 more.  This camera is intended as a high quality point and shoot travel camera and in that realm it succeeds without the added cost for the MKIV.The build quality is fantastic although from my research and what I can tell this camera is not weather sealed which would have of course been preferred.  Other than that the metal construction feels solid the flip out screen feels sturdy enough and the customizable ring is very smooth and functional.  For the most part the buttons are easy enough to press but like others have mentioned the video record button can either be pressed inadvertently or sometimes hard to get to when you need it.The menu is typical for Sony cameras and although I’m used to it having used other Sony cameras I can understand that it would feel a bit clunky to others who aren’t used to it.  For those new to Sony cameras it can definitely take a while to get comfortable and familiar with but it will be in your best interest to learn it and customizing your buttons well.The image quality and video quality are outstanding.  I have not used other high end point and shoot style cameras besides this but I use the A6300 with some decent lenses and I can say that you can take pictures with quality much closer to the A6300 than any other $200-$400 point and shoot.  I don’t want to get into image quality too much because there are a lot of places you can go for very in depth reviews on the image quality but let me just say that it is fantastic.  If you’re coming from a typical point and shoot camera you will be amazed at what this little camera is capable of.Deciding between the MKIII and the MKII was a little difficult as well.  At the time I bought the MKIII the MKII was $250 less.  Part of the reason I went with the MKIII was because of the EVF and the fact that I didn’t plan on using the hotshoe on the MKII.  I’d say for the most part just snapping pictures the LCD screen is fine and easier to use but sometimes there is just too much sun or you really want to look closely and review a shot to make sure you got good focus.  While I steered away from the super slowmo on the MKIV I did want the ability to do some slowmo which the MKIII seemed to have over the MKII.One thing that made it tricky was the fact that the MKIII loses some zoom range going to 24-70(35mm equivalent) from the 28-100 on the MKII.  I do think having better wide angle is more important for this type of camera but it is still somewhat unfortunate for it to lose so much zoon in my opinion.  It does keep the aperture down to f2.8 at 70mm compared to the f4 at the same focal length of the MKII so it does stay pretty bright at the long end which is a major plus for me.There are a few things I’d like to see a little different on this camera.  First off the price is a little high and considering the price drops after the new versions are released I thought this might be a little cheaper.  It isn’t a big deal and you really can’t go into the RX100 line thinking that you’re just getting a point and shoot.Second I would have loved to see a touch screen on this camera.  In fact if the MKIV included a touch screen I would have happily paid the $200 more for a well implemented touch screen.  The touchscreen just makes navigation on the camera so much easier as well as using it to change your focus point.  At the price point I really would have liked to see it but you can live without it.Finally the ergonomics are secondary to style.  They continue with their very minimalist design and while it looks great the metal clad camera is very slippery and small which makes holding comfortably sometimes a challenge.  I bought the adhesive grip sold by Sony for the RX100 and it is great.  It adds a nice bit of rubbery grip to the right side of the camera and it looks great too.  I wish the camera either came like this already or included the nearly $15 dollar grip in the box.  It wasn’t a deal breaker but it would have been a great addition considering the cost.This is not a full in depth review of the camera.  If you want tech specs and a full listing of all of the features there are sites for that because it would take me a long time to go over all of the great features and specs.  This camera is loaded with great features fantastic specs and it produces amazing pictures and video.  What I am trying to do here is tell you why I went with the MKIII considering the MKII and MKIV are both available and are both excellent cameras.  I wanted some slowmo video the better low light capabilities and general image quality and the EVF which the MKII didn’t have but I didn’t need the super slowmo 1/32000 shutter speed and 4k video that the MKIV has.Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and am very impressed with the photos and video that the RX100 MKIII provides.  I considered giving it 4/5 stars for the reasons I stated but felt that the positives outweighed the negatives by a lot.  If you are not happy with the pictures your standard point and shoot is giving you and don’t really want to take the step to mirrorless or DSLR cameras this is what you’re looking for and I can easily recommend the RX100 MKIII.  Be aware that there are currently 4 versions of the RX100 ranging in features and value.  I will update my review should I find anything else great or not so great about the camera.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00K7O2DJU,Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital…,        49 of 53 people found the following review helpful       The perfect little camera when I want high quality and RAW but don't want to carry around DSLR's  July 12  2014By The Creative Fellow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is the camera I have been waiting a looooong time for.I am a professional photographer who does a lot of work overseas. So I find myself traveling with all of my camera gear packed into my Thinktank rolling bag and always have liked to have a small fast camera to use in case I saw something I wanted to shoot. Be it something that just peaked my interest or even if I was on a flight where the flight attendant decided to strip naked swig a bottle of champagne and then deploy the emergency shoot and run away (no that has not really happened on any flights I've been on but you know it could).I wanted to be able to make a picture of something if I needed/wanted to without having to drag my roller out of the overhead and pull a camera out or feeling like the image quality would suffer because of the compromise of having a smaller point and shoot camera. But every other P/S camera I have used over the years left me feeling just that way... it was an image quality compromise either because the sensor was not very good or because the lens was slow or the camera was painfully laggy.So I usually ended up carrying one of my Canon 5d mkIII bodies over my shoulder with the 24-70 on it... which is also not an ideal solution because you have to take it through security and try to keep it from swinging around while carrying bags etc... then you have to find somewhere to put it once you get on your flight.Then I saw this camera... and fell in love with it. The image quality is amazing. It has a sharp and fast Zeiss lens 24-70 f1.8-2.8 fast and accurate autofocus great fps rate (if you need it) and absolutely knockout image quality. I actually used this to shoot some work for a client (alongside my regular pro gear) and a liked a couple of the images so much that they made it into the edit and it is hard to tell the difference between the images shot with pro dslr's and the RX-100M III.This is also the perfect vacation camera or for trips with the kids where I don't want to lug my work gear. It is small and light but is good enough to shoot just about anything that they end up doing on a daytrip/vacation.I have been very pleased with the battery life on this camera. It seems to go an awfully long time for such a small battery.I also like how easy it is to operate settings like exposure compensation flash modes etc. on this camera. It takes seconds and minimal button pushing to reach most of the features one regularly accesses on a small camera like this. Sony really thought this through when designing it.I can't say enough about how good the image quality is. I have not shot the camera in jpg mode only in raw but in some very tricky lighting situations (kids in mid-day sun wearing hats on carnival rides) where you would expect a point-and-shoot to stumble the Sony produces an image with more than enough latitude to burn and dodge a bit to end up with an amazing image. Color looks good as does the contrast. It seems to do a great job with white balance in less than ideal light too.Finally the perfect carry-around small camera to compliment my pro gear has arrived.,0

December 21  2015By Robert,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a truly fantastic compact camera with capabilities and performance that far outshine most smaller cameras of its type.A little background: experienced semi-professional photographer here used to shooting with a full-size pro-level DSLR and pricey lenses.  I wanted a camera that was simpler to carry on off days for personal trips and just keep on hand when not working and not carrying the big camera rig.  This seemed to fit the bill and I've been extremely happy.  Image quality while not *quite* the same as my DSLR is nonetheless stellar.  I've been recommending this to anyone who asks - the performance is truly awesome.Downsides?  Well of course - first it costs a lot more than many compact cameras but the performance is another category entirely.  If you want a budget camera this may not fit.  If you want a reasonably priced camera that can produce pro-level images with less hassle - this is that camera.  On a similar note it's a compact camera....but there are certainly other cameras that are significantly more compact than this.  In it's fully-off and lens-retracted state it is still relatively thick and the weight is more than I expected before I received it.  For me none of these are dealbreakers and if you want amazing image quality you can't get it much smaller than this so that trade is worth it to me.In short - great image quality full manual control variability in control setup solid build a great viewfinder awesome lens and nice clear screen.

March 11  2015By Alex,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera has everything I've ever wanted in a compact.Legitimate viewfinder full manual controls fast lens fast frame rate (10fps+!) and it's very small and light weight.It's the camera I've been waiting for since digital cameras came out. (no joke - there isn't another digital camera on the market that comes even CLOSE to offering what the RX100 III does.)It has officially replaced my Canon 5d3 setup for travel.Excellent as an underwater camera as well (with use of Nauticam underwater housing of course).,1

Over the years I have seen these cameras evolve becoming more powerful with more capacity and features and at increasingly lower prices.  I have a perfectly good Canon Powershot SX 150 and it takes fantastic pictures although it is a bigger camera than this one. But like all people who are looking to find even more features at a better price-point and also looking for a very thin pocket size camera after doing lots of online research I settled on this Nikon.First of all it is small. It is thin and it has many features that I will not go into as they are readily available in the product description. Suffice it to say that I am impressed by this camera. The photos are crisp the menus are intuitive and making adjustments are straightforward. I will not be using the Wi-fi or video features but would expect them to work very well indeed based on the photos. The zoom. while not exactly earth-shaking is more than adequate for the amateur or serious amateur. If you ant more than 8X and are a serious camera enthusiast get one of the $1K+ big boys.The EN-EL 19 battery is wafer thin and takes a while to charge but holds the charge quite well. I will probably get a backup battery and charger for trips.  The camera took a 16GB SDHC class 10 card without a glitch. I am sure it will provide all the capacity I will need.One last thing The instructions that come with the camera are pretty basic. But as is becoming standard practice you can go to the Nikon website and download the BIG instruction manual.1-22-2016:  I have now had this camera for about 9 months. I recently took on a trip to Hawaii and took around 500 photos at the highest resolution. Also took about 16 minutes of videos. The SDHC micro card  easily handled all this information. My experience is that you can get about 300-350 photos on a single charge.  Beforehand I bought a spare battery and charger to take along. It paid off as there was one time I had run out of juice and changing over to the new battery took about 30 seconds.All in all this is a fine camera. It does as you may suspect have limitations compared to other more expensive cameras --  wish the optical zoom was higher but I do like the thinness of the camera. It fit easily into a small side cargo pocket on my shorts and there was really no bulge at all.  It's a keeper.,0

Owning several cameras during my life at 68 I am a more seasoned user since I did take photos for many years with a Mamiya 1000 DTL SLR and numerous lenses and filters. Now I am seeking the lightest weight camera with the highest megapixels and a decent zoom ability - with a user friendly in-camera menu... and of course a better battery source than rechargeable alkaline batteries (which I find very frustrating at best). I own a ten year old Fuji Finepix E550 - and for it's time a great little light weight camera. I have reviewed the real manual (which is downloadable through the Nikon website) - and printed out pages I need to review until they are memorized. The in-camera menus are* intuitive and while the screen is tiny for my tired old eyes - put on your reading glasses and proceed! The buttons and menus are well organized - the ""on/off"" button is a little tiny but unless you have super large hands - should not be an issue. Not having a 'view finder' is a drawback - but in such a tiny camera I will get used to using the screen.  My first few photos taken were excellent and I am a happy camper. I hope this camera holds up well since I love it already.",1

Is it the best camera ever? No of course not. It's a point and shoot camera. But it's a good one.I've not owned a Nikon before and decided to give it a try. There's a lot less features on this then other similar cameras on the market especially in regards to different ""modes"". For the most part I don't even notice that the modes are limited to under ten though I do miss my Sunset mode.Where this camera shines in in the close-up detailed nature shots. The colors it can capture at close range are amazing for a point and shoot and I find it focuses easily even against reds and purples that other cameras have trouble with. Everything is crisp in the Marco setting and if you are out of focus you can try before clicking the button all the way and taking the picture; the display is that good.The place where this camera looses some of its' appeal is in action shots. For me this is not a big deal since I mainly take nature photos; nothing is moving in the frame. However if you plan to take action or speed shots this may not be the best option. It takes a moment (even without a flash) to snap the picture. This can mean you might miss something darting by.The menus and displays are slower too and the camera takes a minute between each shot and when you turn it on and so forth. I'm not sure what the delay is about but if you can be patient with it you probably won't mind.All in all this is a great camera for the price and that's all any of us can ask for.",0

I purchased it to replace a 'Coolpix' model S2 which finally died after some 5 years of pretty heavy use.  It took me some time to learn how to operate this camera for taking close up shots of stamps in an album which at least 50% of my useage is for.  With the S2 I mounted the camera on a tripod that positioned the camera lens maybe 14 inches above the object to be photographed.  I used the zoom feature to where I was able to enlarge a single stamp to fill almost the entire photo.  Trying to do this with the S3700 on the same tripod using the close up setting didn't work.  (Could not focus).  Actually had the same problem with an S2800 which I returned to Amazon after speaking with Nikon customer service who recommended I return the camera to their service department. (Also learned that the S 2800 was an old product).  It was only after again having had the same problem with the first example of the S3700 which I again returned to Amazon because of the same scenario wth a Nikon customer service rep that I got to talk to a Nikon Service rep that understood what was happening when I again experienced the problem with the second example of the S3700.  He informed me that the camera lens on the S3700 must be within 2 or 3 inches of the object when operating in the 'macro mode' setting. The Nikon instruction manual makes no mention of this.  Once I purchased a 'Goliton Mini Desktop tripod' all my problems were solved.  I think the close up shots now are even better than those I used to get with the S2.,0

For whatever reason the charger that came with the product doesn't seem to work properly and the charging lamp on the camera which is supposed to indicate that it's charging doesn't turn on. I've decided to purchase another charger in hopes that the problem will be fixed but as a certified refurbished product I would've preferred that everything is in working condition right out of the box. As the first time I've ever bought a refurbished product I am incredibly disappointed. Hopefully the next buyer will have a better experience.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00T85PUJY,Nikon COOLPIX S3700 Digital Camera with…, Positive  but iffy  February 12  2017By Amazon CustomerVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I got this camera for a trip that I'm going to be taking in august so I didn't plan on using it a whole lot before hand. I've turned it on a couple times and taken a total of four pictures. Overall I'd say I've had it on for 5 minutes collectively if not less. With just that little bit of time the battery has already died and it came fully charged. It doesn't come with a charger so I've got one on it's way along with an extra battery. I'm scared that it may not be the battery but the camera. Some of the buttons also don't want to work sometimes. It's a bit moody. Other than that everything else is positive. The picture quality is better than I originally thought it would be. The camera is small and lightweight perfect for someone like me who wants to take it hiking. I think for the price and it being refurbished it was a pretty good deal. Be sure to include the price of what the accessories are going to be. (I.e. Charger wrist strap SD card/ computer A/V cord) it doesn't come with any of that so you may end up paying a bit more. I just hope that I can figure out the battery problem and it's not something unfixable.,0

I have owned many Nikon cameras without problem.  the shutter was slow to respond I missed many shots. Focus was difficult. I couldn't get panoramic to work kept saying failed.  WIFI connection was null could not get any connectivity to any of my devices doesn't connect to the computer via USB either.  this is just a few issues.  now i am trying to return for a refund and only option i get is to send for repair.  I want a full refund not a repair.  It should have worked right out of the box it was not a refurbish purchase.  I would not buy this camera again. I received the 'repaired' camera back - still doesn't work.  I want a full refund guess now I have to contact AMAZON by phone to make that happen.,0

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00I8BIB1S,Sony DSCWX350 18 MP Digital Camera…,        83 of 86 people found the following review helpful       A VERY CAPABLE POCKET SIZE CAMERA  June 30  2014By RTS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Pros:Size20X Optical zoom (40X Digital)Excellent battery lifeGood image qualityVery good image stabilizerHD moviesCons:LED screen can be hard to see in bright sunlight.No viewfinderThis camera is easy to use.  For those who want to shoot nice photos without fuss just choose the automated setting you prefer and forget about it.  I find the automatic settings produce very good results over all.  I think either the Intelligent Auto or Superior Auto (higher quality) setting will produce acceptable results in almost all situations.  For movies just press the movie button on the top rear of the camera to begin recording and press it again to stop.  It's as simple as that.I have found the auto focus to be quick and accurate under varying conditions.  The only exception to this may be long telephoto shots in minimal light.  For non telephoto shots in low light the camera has an auto focus illuminator which lights for a second to establish focus.  This works well.  The camera controls are easy to use and have a nice feel to them..It took a little while for me to get acquainted with Sony's menu system but once you get the hang of where they put things it's ok.  Frequently adjusted settings such as flash on / off single shot / burst mode and what info is displayed on the screen and can be selected quickly with one tap on the control wheel on the back of the camera with no need to go into the menus.Shooting still photos couldn't be easier.  Aim and press the button the camera does the rest.  The camera produces good images.About Movies.  A couple of things I noticed.  The sound of the zoom motor that is picked up by the camera is minimal in my opinion.  More noticeable was noise in the form of little clicks and squeaks introduced by my fingers physically handling the camera and operating the telephoto zoom switch.  Considering the small size of the camera and the close proximity of your hands controls and the microphones I think that most cameras of this type are going to pick up some sounds.  With careful attention to your hands on the camera while shooting movies you should be able to minimize the amount of noise you introduce by physically handling the camera controls.  The camera also has a wind noise reduction setting for shooting movies. It seems to be effective.I expected that the image quality of the camera at 20X zoom and especially at 40X (20X optical 20X digital zoom) would be marginal at best.  To my surprise I found that the image stabilization works exceptionally well and that hand held shots at 20X are quite acceptable even at 40X you can anticipate acceptable results.  I shot hand held videos of a hummingbird at a feeder at 30X and the video came out clear and in focus.  Amazing.The manual states the camera can use SDHC or SDXC memory cards.  When researching which camera to buy I found conflicting information on various sites whether the SDXC cards were supported.  I am happy to report that they are.  I am using an SDXC Class 10 80MB read/write speed 64GB capacity card with no problems.  I would recommend a fast card that can keep up with writing to the card while recording HD movies or taking burst shots.  I have not experienced any problems using this card.  The manual states that the camera has been tested to accept up to 64GB SDHC or SDXC cards. Implying that it may or may not support larger capacity cards.  If you think 64GB may not be enough capacity for you I might suggest buying extra 64GB cards rather than chancing a larger (and more expensive) card.The camera has a solid feel to it.  Some reviews felt that the camera was so small that it was difficult to hold.  I do not find this to be the case. I have large hands and have had no problems in that area.I purchased a separate Sony battery charger (Model No. BC-TRX) so I could be charging a battery while using the other battery in the camera.  As for charge times.  The initial charge using the camera to charge the battery took about 2 ½ hours.  Using the Sony battery charger took about 2 hours to fully charge the battery.  The difference in charge times may or may not be due to the amount of charge if any in the new battery to begin with.I don't have a need for WiFi so I can't comment on that feature.For those who don't want to deal with a lot of manual settings to take good pictures this camera should serve you well.  If you want or need more manual control over your picture taking this likely isn't the camera for you.AN ADDITIONAL NOTE ON FLASH PHOTOS.  Taking a flash photo that is very close to the subject in my instance about 6"" the cameras extended lens casts a small arched shadow in the lower left corner of the picture as it blocks the output of the flash in that direction.  Otherwise the picture taken this close with flash had a good exposure not too bright or washed out as might be suspected. It looked good.",0

November 13  2014By Angela,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Well I decided to get another Sony Cybershot since my other one got stolen. I am not sure of the model I just know I bought it a couple years ago. It's pretty much the same quality as my other. This camera does best with animals and outdoors which is fine because I mostly take pictures of my dogs parks and then pictures of family&I. The low light pictures are good however they do come out blurry. The camera takes excellent pictures on flash no red eye and actually really makes your eyes pop if you have blue or green eyes. The one thing I don't like is on the top the wheel to change the settings it's super tight and chips my nail just to turn it. I feel for the price I could have gotten an older Cybershot and got the same quality pictures it DOES have some lens flare... but overall it is a good camera and does exceedingly well on automatic. I have attached pictures in my review of pictures I took with the camera.,1

The digital zoom is garbage but you can lock it out and use just the optical. This also happens to be the nicest and smallest 1080p/60 video camera I own so I frequently use that feature as well without any hiccups at all so far. I can record about 7000 shots at 18MP or ~5 hours of 1080/60 video onto a 32gb card.This camera never leaves my side on vacation and it's effortless to pocket or put on a belt clip. There's more depth and features to the camera than I have time to review but I wanted to offer my general sentiments and some shots I've taken using this model. It is definitely worth considering if you want to step up the quality of your effortlessly shot vacation photos. If you want something more technical or professional you should probably look elsewhere.,1

Like some of the other customers the ON/OFF switch quit working.  The online manual said to obtain a new battery and after doing so - there is no change.  While this camera has received many positive reviews there are still issues with it.  It's too expensive to purchase taking a chance of it not working after a year.,0

The note 5 is better. I had a very hard time making this camera take decent shots everything indoor was so blurry even with sun coming through the windows! I would say 9 out of 10 shots were so blurry that I had to delete them. It was like the shutter speed was stuck on turtle mode. The pictures taken at night were not any better than my phone as well so a miss on that. I guess this camera is good if you are only going to take pictures outside of things that do not move at all...like a rock.. if there is any wind to blow the subject then you can forget about it.I really wanted to love this camera and I'm sad that I can't.,0

In other words they rather mangle a gray scale.I've checked out several point-and-shoot cameras (Canon Nikon Sony and Kodak) on a calibrated achromatic reflectance chart and did not like what I saw. The chart has chips of known reflectance which are supposed to be reproduced at specific values. Generally speaking these cameras reproduce dark tones much too dark resulting in a tremendous loss of detail in dark regions even in a brightly-lit scene. As a result shaded areas go into a black hole. I suspect the built-in jpg encoder is to blame. Taking a RAW file and applying a gamma law of 2.2 or the sRGB curve would hopefully give better results. Unfortunately RAW files require a great deal of space in memory and the cameras tend to be expensive.The Sony DSC-WX350 takes pictures which are just this side of adequate and are probably fine for the casual non-critical snapshooter. The camera's ergonomics and user interface are OK and the battery charges while hooked up to a computer via USB a nice feature. Depending on the setting the jpg files are of reasonable size enabling the storage of many exposures on a memory card. The lens is no great shakes and exhibits a bit of portholing. Again for the non-critical vacationer this camera is probably fine. If accurate photographic reproduction is desired you're probably looking at a much more expensive camera.Of the four cameras mentioned above I'm keeping the Sony DSC-WX350.,0

I had the previous model and it worked great; it took fair photographs. I bought this one to replace that when it broke. The image quality is so poor that you can take better photos using a smart phone (I'm not kidding). I don't know what Sony did to the sharpness... all photos I took using this camera are just blah. They increased the amount of megapixels but I guess the sensor and/or lenses are of inferior quality than Sony's previous standards?,0

Snyder,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera takes amazingly high quality photos for the price.We purchased this for my mother who travels a lot and back then had refused to get a smart phone so she took all photos with her film camera (yes in 2014/2015). We tried out every camera we could find in our $300 or less price range at Best Buy CostCo Fryes etc. and read as many reviews as we could but this camera was BY FAR the best quality.  Once we started taking photos this camera blew the rest away.My mother now is using her iPad and smart phone to take photos but I still have to remind her that this camera is far better to use for travel. I may steal it from her if she stops using it it is that good. After all sometimes you may want to blow up your photo snapshots and this is a great camera for that purpose.,0

We have rarely been disappointed. The Sony DSC-WX350 is a very small camera which is capable of producing excellent image quality in both still and video modes.It is capable of recording video in true 1080  60 P quality.The camera appears to have a very high build quality.The supplied documentation is very poor and it is very easy to confuse the input areas for USB and Power. There is a very detailed manual available online but we think a camera of this cost should have some kind of users manual included in the box.We found the image quality (especially when set to the highest settings) to be generally excellent and the same can be said of the video. If you want to record/transfer in the highest video quality settings (1080 60 P) you need a very high quality SDHC card as the video transfer rate is 28 MBPS.The following criticism is partially due to our age and declining vision. If you have excellent vision you can probably ignore this portion of the review.We found the camera controls and buttons to be very small hard to differentiate/discern and the controlling actions themselves to be somewhat confusing. There is no touch screen control at all and selections are made by various controlling buttons. This made the camera difficult to set up use and control.  You will find yourself frequently double checking which control your fingers are accessing.One interesting feature is the ability to change the aspect ratio of the still images.All in all this is a very small camera with a big performance capability.Touch screen control would make this camera rate 5+!,0

Of course the photo quality and colour cant be compared to those expensive underwater cameras but It held up well for my maldives snorkelling for 2 full days (2-3 snorkelling session which are at least 1 hour long) with lithium battery.

We just finished viewing all the wonderful pictures that our son took and this helped share the memories our son had on his trip.  I didn't have to show my son much on how to use this camera and we sent him with 10 pairs of batteries because of the poor battery reviews.  He went through only 3 pairs of AAA batteries took close to 400 pictures and about 20 minutes of video.Now the caveat about a camera in this price range is that he took a ton of pictures and when he zoomed in he had to have a nearly flawless grip on the camera or the photo was pretty much worthless.  But he figured it out pretty quick and started to hold the camera with more stability when he zoomed in and he was able to get some very good pictures even while zoomed.  So don't expect this camera to be some super point and shoot magic photo taking machine.  It's a $69 camera that was essentially a ""throw away"" just in case our son happened to lose it on his first trip away from home.Our son also used it for snorkeling and again there were some bad pictures in the bunch but he took so many pictures that there were plenty of absolutely wonderful and colorful underwater photos.  Again for a $69 camera we are quite happy with the outcome for a 12 year old who has had very little time with taking photos.  I'm sure with a more stable hand and a bit more experience with this little camera the photos could have been even better.Finally he used the camera to take video as well.  The quality of videos followed suit with how stable he held the camera and if he zoomed.  Most of the videos came out wonderful.  Sound quality wasn't all that great but the video he was taking was pretty much of the animals he interacted with.  In fact it grabbed an awesome shot of him feeding a tarpin fish who jumped out of the water and swallowed not only the bait but his entire hand capturing his wonderful laugh and his friends commenting on how awesome that was.  Definitely not HD quality but for a mom and dad who sent their son off on his own for the first time in his life we were able to feel like we shared the experience with him.Absolutely NO regrets on purchasing this camera.  Yes we could have spent double or even triple the amount of money on another underwater camera and perhaps on a future trip we will send him off with a better camera but as a great lesson in responsibility our son showed he could care for this less expensive camera and take some great photos to share with his family.",0

August 26  2015By SB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought this for a trip to a waterpark - it worked great!  No problems at all. I bought some Duracell Quantum batteries for it (it takes 2 AAAs) and they lasted through two days of picture and video-taking and are still going strong. You do need to buy a micro memory card for it as well. Was very durable we took it down slides and swam with it underwater quite awhile. Then our son played around with it afterward at the hotel pool taking photos and videos as he jumped in over and over.  I was so impressed at how well it functioned never any issues with it. Photos came out nice as well although I can't really give a good review of those as we were just taking pictures for fun not for documenting underwater wildlife or anything. The photo I'm putting on here was taken with the medium-quality setting but there are higher-quality settings as well.,1

July 9  2015By Bat Elohim,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So this is a waterproof camera. It is designed to take pictures outside in and around water. It is not for taking classy portraits. If you are looking for a fun easy-to-use water camera for taking pictures of your family at the pool or lake or amateur snorkeling pictures this seems to be a great choice. If you are a professional photographer looking for a top-of-the-line underwater National-Geographic camera then this is not what you are looking for. This is great for the price.

A waterproof camera so this was it! The picture is NOT that great i would say comparable to a kids camera or one of those action cams BUT its waterproof so he took it in the tub and i dont hv to worry about it getting wet which is so nice! He really enjoyed taking it in the tub for now since its winter time.. Hopefully it lasts till summer so he can take in the pool! I didnt find the menu hard to use at all and the batteries were NOT hard at all for me to get in (which is what a few ppl mentioned on here) one big thing i can say is that this camera requires a MINI memory card! Luckily i bought one that was both! But def make sure i look at that before buying one! I gave it 4 stars b/c i really thought the picture would be better but oh well! I can take pictures and videos as well!,0

Looks more like an adult camera than The fisher price one but the picture quality wouldn't work for most adults. That being said it has given us tons of fun in our pool the bath and at the river and I feel we got our money's worth. I would recommend for a young photographer who is more interested in the idea of a camera than the photos.

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01DLLJ8CU,Sony DSC-RX10 III Cyber-shot Digital…,        161 of 169 people found the following review helpful       The decathlete of digital cameras?  May 11  2016By D. F. Watt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a somewhat revised review based on an additional month or more of experience with this camera. This is my seventh Sony digital camera (Sony Alpha 55/65/99/77ii) and my third RX model (after owning and loving both the RX1 & RX100III). So you could say I’m biased or alternatively pretty comfortable with Sony products and operating systems. There is little question that Sony is at the head of the class in designing sensors for digital cameras and they lead if not dominate the sensor market all the way from cell phones to medium format and virtually everything in between. On the other hand there have been times when users might readily question whether they have clearly moved past simply making great sensors to creating great cameras and great camera systems.  The latter takes a very different set of technical skills from the former.Opinions on this vary of course but I believe that their recent products suggest that Sony continues to learn evolve and improve their grasp of what it takes to create a great camera (and system) beyond simply a great sensor. This latest effort is overall most impressive with only a few caveats and minor problems. Indeed if you could carry only one camera with one lens with you on a long trip and were not constrained to carry something that would fit just in your pocket I cannot imagine a better choice for an enormous variety of shooting situations for both video and stills. It’s the digital photography equivalent of a brilliantly balanced decathlete who can’t really challenge the best in the world at the glamour events of sprinting (analogously not as good as FF professional equipment in stills photography where their DR and low light S/N performance is clearly way better) but whose overall excellence and versatility is very tough to equal.  And in good light it’s capable of taking excellent still images and simply stunning video. Its video is leagues better than virtually any professional full frame stills camera excepting the Sony A7Rii/ASii (two models that can equal it in the HD and 4k video department). It offers very high quality video in both more traditional 1080p as well as newer 4K modes and excellent still photography image quality as long as you stay under ISO 800 (and frankly ISO 400 is a reasonable limit if you’re shooting JPEGs and want fairly clean images). The lens provides an enormous range of view angles from wide-angle to super telephoto plus a macro ability at 600mm and with generally excellent optical quality.  The lens itself a technological tour de force and recent formal testing suggests that it is sharper at least most of the time than the lens on the competing Panasonic FZ 1000 as well as perhaps slightly sharper than the fine lens on the RX10 Mark 2. The lens alone might be almost worth the purchase price as there’s nothing like it available on larger APS-C or full frame sensors.  Its optical quality easily exceeds the nearest APS-C competition the recently released 16-300 Tamron which has only ¾ the reach and is not nearly as fast and that lens is not remotely as sharp all the way out (at a 450mm equivalent view) as this lens is at 600mm equiv. view.  Of course it’s not a fair comparison as smaller sensors allow the construction of lenses that would simply be huge (and hugely expensive) on larger sensors. Still with all these qualifications it’s a very impressive lens.  I would argue based on recent testing (see the DPR and IR reviews) that it’s the best 24-600 anyone has built up to this point in time (and it’s in another league from the only other 24-600 on a 1” sensor the lens on the Canon G3x).For those unfamiliar with the RX10 line some history might be useful. The original Sony RX 10 Mark 1 came out with basically the same operating system and sensor as the hugely successful much more compact Sony RX100 but with a significantly larger and faster and more versatile 24-200 2.8 lens and a correspondingly larger form factor. Features on that groundbreaking first model included:20.9 MP 1”-type Exmor R CMOS sensor with BSI construction24-200mm equivalent F2.8 lens with optical image stabilizationUp to 10 FPS continuous shootingISO 125 - 12800 (expandable to ISO 80)3” tiltable LCD with 1228000 dotsBuilt-in 1.44M dot electronic viewfinder1080 60p/24p HD video with full exposure control (MPEG-4/AVCHD)Raw/JPEG/ Raw+JPEGBuilt-in flash and expandable Smart Accessory Shoe for system accessoriesEye AF function detects and focuses on a subject’s eyeBuilt-in Wi-Fi and NFC for sharing and remote camera controlBright F2.8 Zeiss Vario Sonnar T* Lens (24-200mm)Fast AF thanks to new “BIONZ X” processing engine (but using CDAF instead of on-sensor PDAF).It easily garnered a Gold Award from DP Review but it was rather expensive on release at $1300 although it has now dropped significantly to only $800 less than two thirds that price. It was fairly successful commercially although its high price made it less attractive than its closest large sensor compact rival the Panasonic FZ 1000 (which used the same Sony sensor as the RX10) but which sported a lens that went twice as long to 400 mm even if not a constant f2.8 – and it offered in body 4K two very significant advantages all for a $300 lower price. It generally looked like clearly the better value and was rated slightly higher on DPR also easily garnering a Gold Award.Sony was clearly not content to rest on this first benchmark and knew that they needed to up their game in view of Panasonic’s impressive offering in the FZ 1000. That original model RX10 released in early 2014 was updated early last year in the RX10 Mark 2 which provided all of the previously mentioned features plus some very significant upgrades centered around a ‘stacked’ sensor with very fast data readout enabled by the layered sensor construction allowing extremely high frame rates up to 960 FPS in slightly down-rezed HD along with now being able to do in-body 4K recording (finally!) and gaining a useful bump in continuous shooting from 10 frames per second to 14 frames per second (but with AF locked from the first frame). Sony has chosen (at least so far) not to sell this new sensor to the competition so there are no directly competing compact larger sensor compacts from Canon Nikon or Panasonic (unclear what the sensor is in the new Nikon DL 24-500 which is late arriving to market due to production problems in Japan but it’s not likely a Sony sensor). In any case this seems to parallel their new-found reluctance to sell their state-of-the-art full frame 42 megapixel BSI sensor to Nikon. Perhaps they’ve decided that when they have a technological advantage they’re no longer going to give it away even at a premium cost to the competition. Perhaps long overdue?Both of those predecessor RX 10 (I/II) models are still available so the RX 10 Mark 3 is intended to be their ‘big brother’ taking all of the advances in the Mark 2 and adding the impressive 24-600 f 2.4-4.0 Zeiss lens. The weight penalty from the 3x longer telephoto reach increases only modestly from 849g to 1095g (both weights w/batteries). This creates essentially a super-zoom ‘bridge camera’ but with a significantly larger sensor than that class of camera has traditionally contained. And while it can’t compete with the truly ridiculous 83x optical zoom of the Nikon P900 its 24x zoom exceeds anything currently available on the 1” Sony sensor. Given that the newest version of this exceptional sensor is still only available currently in Sony products this means that these cameras are without real peers – although there is now more competition with several more compact travel zooms from both Canon and Panasonic using an earlier version of the 1 inch Sony sensor in addition to the aforementioned Panasonic FZ 1000 – but nothing remotely as fast as this lens.  Additionally initial testing suggests that this lens is significantly sharper than the lens on the Panasonic FZ 1000.So . . . . how does it function? Overall I’d have to say exceptionally well although it’s not perfect and its autofocus system is still a LARGE step down from the best PDAF systems particularly in low light and like its predecessors the price of admission is steep. Then again there’s nothing quite like it and although it will clearly not take the place of full frame or even APS-C equipment in low light or for shooting wildlife or sports at the highest possible image quality with long telephoto primes it offers a set of functional competencies in a single package that are extraordinary even when you have to take into consideration its rather steep price. You get what you pay for here.  I would say that if you weigh still image and video image quality equally it’s the best camera I’ve ever had and the best on the market for under $3k – and only bested by the likes of the Sony A7Rii and A7Sii but not on the video side only on the still image side.The photographs at the end of the review show the RX10iii compared to an APS-C semipro a77ii body with a Sony 70-400 G2 lens offering comparable telephoto reach.  Although that big and heavy combination (costing nearly $3000 or twice the cost of the Sony RX 10iii) clearly takes better pictures as ISO drifts past 800 or when autofocus demands are particularly challenging in bright light and when the target is not challenging the CDAF there is little to separate this camera from an expensive APS-C rig costing twice as much and weighing almost three times as much.  Additionally when I’m using the RX10iii and taking advantage of the ~ one stop faster lens aperture and the two stops better OIS I can undercut the ISO of a larger ILC by two stops at least where the 1” sensor is now less noisy than the sensor in the A77ii.  To be clear I’m not suggesting that this camera can replace APS-C let alone full frame equipment for taking the best possible picture particularly in challenging light but I am impressed with how close it can get in good light and where the autofocus system is not unduly challenged. And the 4k video is so good when displayed on a 4k set that has been properly adjusted and calibrated that it will take your breath away.  It’s like looking through a window onto the subject matter.  And the audio is excellent to boot.  If you love video don’t mind getting bigger hard drives and like a ‘single solution’ that avoids all lens switching hassles (and lots of other hassles too associated with that big bag of gear you’ve been toting for years) buy one.  If you’re not sure rent one.  It will likely win you over in short order.Pros:1) Extraordinary ‘stacked’ BSI 1 inch sensor with exceptional versatility capable of 4K video in body high resolution 20 megapixel stills variable high frame rate video up to 960 FPS an overall package of capabilities currently unmatched by any single system in the digital photography world.2) Customizable menu and operating system with high degree of menu organization overlap with other Sony cameras (but see cons).  You can customize this to the moon in terms of several custom buttons and multiple settings such as whether aperture ring has click stops or smooth action.3) Overall very good photo IQ quality with decent lowlight ability.  Good JPEGs to ISO 400-800 and usable RAW to 1600 and perhaps even to 3200 for smaller prints and web postings – losing ~ 1.5 stops in low light ability compared to the Sony A6300 which is competitive with the best APS-C bodies and about 2.5-3 stops compared to full frame.4) Remarkable 24-600 f2.4-4 lens that has very few weaknesses (but see cons). Sharp contrasty and with variable speed zooming action. Capable of minimal focusing distance of 2.3 feet essentially making it a .4x macro lens at 600 mm.5) Exceptional video rivaling professional 4K equipment and excellent sharpness and definition with minimal moiré at both 4K and 1080p. Many advanced video features including various S log profiles focus peaking flat picture profile etc. Possibly an even better video cam than still cam?6) Decent autofocus – certainly a step down from the A77II but not nearly as bad as several reviews have suggested (but see cons). In good light AF is reasonably fast and accurate. And given the CDAF on-sensor no endless fiddling with MFA (I dislike dealing with MFA on cameras with traditional separate dedicated PDAF arrays).7) Excellent EVF fully the equal of the unit on the A77ii bright contrasty fast and very sharp. Image stabilized (even more so than the A77ii which also sports this feature given virtue #8).  You get to see exactly what the picture is going to look like before you shoot it.  After you’ve used a first rate EVF OVFs seem quite primitive and confining.8) Highly effective IS worth ~ 4-5 stops.  This is significantly improved from the previous model.  I have taken many shots at 1/10 sec (!) exposure (on non-moving subjects) at 600mm equiv. view and had many of them be quite sharp.  Significantly mitigates noisier 1 inch sensor and allows you to shoot at lower ISOs (can typically beat ISO of a Sony A77ii which has a less effective IBIS by two stops).9) Both zoom and focus rings are now on the lens barrel and can be customized in terms of placement (either ring can be assigned to zoom or focus) and lens zoom speed is nicely variable – but see cons.10) Video IS has options for modes that offer very impressive stabilization at least in 1080p (if not in 4k).11) Excellent if not remarkable remote control software in form of numerous apps.  Apps can be activated easily from a custom button allowing for example total smart phone remote control time lapse star trails or special portrait face processing among the many useful Sony app store apps.Cons:1) Weight and balance. Not only is this significantly heavier than the RX 10II but it’s a bit front heavy with the lens.2) Menu system – many have commented on the top heavy and cumbersome nature of the Sony operating system where you often have to do a lot of menu diving. Somewhat offset by the highly accessible Function menu which gives you easy access to your most frequently changed settings and by the highly customizable buttons.3) Not the camera for sports action junkies. Continuous autofocus is disappointing if you’re coming from dedicated PDAF arrays and it’s a large step down from the Sony A77II and other large bodied cameras with excellent PDAF.4) Clearly struggles a bit with autofocus in low light - one suspects the next generation will have PDAF or perhaps hybrid PDAF-CDAF. Takes significantly longer to achieve AF lock in dimly lit indoor scenes and you often times have to hunt for a high contrast edge.  PDAF is likely in line for the RX10M4?5) Lack of a touchscreen is a deficit for some although not for this user.  However this is a consistent complaint in reviews (including no doubt in the upcoming DPR review).6) As a minor ergonomic gripe the back control buttons are virtually flat with the surface instead of more raised up making simple tactile location and control more challenging and requiring more focused attention.7) The focus and zoom ring control systems are both fly-by-wire systems and lack any version of tactile feedback or immediacy.8) Video IS during 4k is limited to the least effective (but still decent) base IS mode (presumably limited to prevent overheating).9) As minor gripe deleting images on smartphone not allowed from smartphone.10) As another minor gripe lens retraction is automatic after a minute or so of inactivity (configurable as a menu item?).Pros and Cons Relative to the Panasonic FZ 1000Pros (Relative to the Sony)Way cheaper (basically half the cost)Faster Autofocus (DFD is excellent)Less turgid menu structure?Cons (Relative to the Sony)Not nearly as much reach (400mm vs. 600mm)Lens not a sharp or as fast (Sony is f4 at long end)Sony has better build quality and is weather resistantSony may have 4k IQ advantageSony may have a JPEG engine advantageThe well-informed reader will note that both the Panasonic FZ 2500 and the Nikon DL 24-500 are conspicuous by their absence as these are both still unavailable and the Nikon is looking like it's not going to be available any time soon whereas the FZ 2500 is supposedly shipping in November.  It's likely that the new Panasonic model will continue to autofocus faster than the RX10iii with Panasonic's excellent Depth-from-Defocus algorithms.  However it's unlikely that the lens even though they've extended it to 480mm will be fully the equal of the 24-600 F2.4-4 in terms of sharpness and it certainly isn't as fast at the long end but getting within half a stop of the Sony at 480 (f4.5 vs.f4).  The FZ 2500 however it does have a very video-centric operating system and it's possible that with all the upgrades that it equals or perhaps even slightly exceeds the RX10iii in the 4k video department - and most regard the current 4K video coming from the FZ 1000 as perhaps not quite fully the equal of the 4K coming from the Sony RX10M3.  The Nikon DL 24-500 has the advantage of a hybrid autofocus system phase detection on chip which is likely to offer faster autofocus than the simpler contrast detection method on the Sony but nobody's actually seen one of these cameras or tested one so who knows.  The DL is also supposed to offer high frame rate video but the lens is neither as long nor as fast as the Sony's.  On the other hand both the new Panasonic FZ 2500 ($1200) and the Nikon DL ($1000) are going to significantly undercut the price of the Sony RX10M3 which should put some downward price pressure on the Sony model.  Competition is after all good for the consumer and prices.  Right now as of the first week in October this camera still doesn't really have any true competition as neither the Nikon DL 24-500 or the new Panasonic FZ 2000/2500 have even been tested by the digital photography press – And right now they're both unavailable. For those with smaller budgets both the Panasonic FZ1000 and the Sony RX10M2 remain the most attractive options.In any case I’m finding far more to like than dislike as I get to know the camera and its systems - I'm now in my fourth month of ownership. As a neat bonus for those with other Sony cams you can simply drop your SD card from an RX100 or other Sony product into this and go and your photos and videos across different bodies appear in a neat chronological order when reviewing and in their normal folder (as long as you don’t stray from the default folder assignments). I’m finding this a big plus and highly convenient as I can rotate the SD card from body to body depending on what I’m shooting. While I can’t review or magnify photos from an A77ii or RX1 (due to the larger image dimensions?) I can still see them in the viewfinder and all RX100 photos can be conventionally magnified and manipulated. As another neat bonus there are a huge number of useful apps although not cheap with many of them $10 at Sony app store (but some are $5 and some are free). Some are potentially very useful for specialized shooting situations: Star Trails and Time Lapse apps a super-bracketing app a Sky ultra-high HDR app and both sync to smartphone and smart remote control apps (both free). While some of these may strike some users as gimmicky the results so far suggest the apps are quite effective at what they do.  In fact the remote control app that works both for this model and various RX 100 iterations is possibly the best in its class and allows you to control many shooting parameters from a smartphone remotely.  When shooting on a tripod it's really quite useful. It allows super-stealthy shutter activations (as far as 30 ft. away from the camera) without any chance of moving the camera when you press the shutter button.  Don’t leave home without it.  I have gotten some amazing wildlife picture using the smartphone remote app from inside the house while the camera and tripod are outside.I’m impressed with the fundamental truth of the old aphorism – “it’s all trade-offs”. While this camera comes close to excelling at everything there are still important compromises that you must appreciate: this camera trades off some weight and slightly more compact size against its smaller brother RX-10II trades off any version of ‘pocketability’ to the RX 100 series trades off photo (but not video) image quality against bigger APS-C let alone FF equipment and trades off cost against the slightly less capable Panasonic FZ1000 and the minimally less capable RX-10II. You’ll have to decide for yourself what your optimum balance points might be and how you might trade your favorite virtue against other functional competencies particularly how much ‘pocketability’ trumps excellence in other areas. Certainly there is little difference in picture quality – if you are shooting at 24-70 mm – between this camera and the much more compact RX-100IV. So for shooting where I simply can’t stand to carry anything even moderately sized this will not displace the Sony RX100 (I have the M3 version). However for a ‘single solution’ encompassing high degrees of competence in relationship to both still photography and videos and offering an enormous range of focal lengths it’s hard to find a more balanced athlete than the Sony RX 10 III. There is a reason why is camera is sold out virtually everywhere and often backordered all the way to November . . . demand for this kind of exceptional flexibility and versatility has been running very high ever since its introduction in May.  And Sony concedes that they have grossly underestimated the enormous demand for this camera and they are scrambling to catch up.,1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01DLLJ8CU,Sony DSC-RX10 III Cyber-shot Digital…,        77 of 84 people found the following review helpful       The Sony RX10iii is a remarkable camera that is as good a video camera as it is a still photography camera.  May 6  2016By Kirk Tuck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is a superb camera the capabilities of which seem to be lost on people who would just judge it as a casual camera. Starting with video: The cameras shoots in UHD 4K video at 100 mbs. The files are sampled at 6K and down sampled to 4K making it very very sharp. The files are not binned or line skipped; you get a full sensor read for every frame which means again sharpness and high image quality. The camera features cinematic profiles including S-Log-2 and every one of the video profiles can be customized with a wide range of parameters which will be familiar to professional videographers (gamma black level knee etc.). The camera also includes a microphone input and an audio circuit unhampered by AGC (automatic gain control) so you can actually set microphone levels to your taste or set a single point that's be calibrated in conjunction with an off camera mixer or digital audio recorder and then you can use physical control knobs on the mixer to even more effectively set levels.I have tested the video from the camera I bought (locally) and found it to be superb. I underexposed a little bit (my fault) and I could see some shadow noise start to creep in at ISO 800 but exposed correctly I would feel comfortable shooting up to 1600 for interviews and up to 3200 for images with lots of detail that might hide noise.Speaking of interviews the camera also features a headphone jack which will help you get better sound by monitoring. Also included is professional caliber time code and the ability to ""mark"" your screens with ""safe zones""  center marks and other guides to composition. In my mind this is a full on professional video camera and one I will use in conjunction with the previous model to do work with for paying clients.Now add to this a full 29.99 minute record time with no over heating and you have the makings of a perfect hybrid camera.But there's more. The lens is amazing and it delivers everything Sony promises. I have samples on my blog site which show amazing sharpness handheld at the 600mm equivalent. Some less well educated reviewers have said that the camera does not really have an f4.0 or f2.4 (at wide) aperture but of course they are dead wrong. What they are trying to say is that one does not get the same depth of field flexibility with smaller sensor cameras. That part is true but rest assured you are not getting a ""slower"" lens. f4.0 is f4.0 because it always describes a geometric relationship.Moving on. The still portion of the camera is on par with the still capabilities of its immediate predecessor; which is to say Pretty darn good. While it is not a low light monster like a Nikon D750 it does very well with shooting situations that go all the way down to ISO 3200. Is there noise? Of course! But it's not obnoxious unless you underexpose.There is always negativity about the small Sony battery but I've gotten an hour and ten minutes from a freshly charged battery while shooting video (worst case scenario) and that's just a little shy of what I was getting from a Nikon D810 battery when shooting video with that camera.Do not buy this camera if you are imagining that it is small and light. It is not. The physics of the lens preclude that. But it feels good in my hands and the extra space on the grip and the overall surface of the camera is welcome.The still images especially raws processed in Adobe Camera Raw software are great. At ISOs like 80 and 100 they are amazing. Rich color and great sharpness. This is a camera that WILL require reading the manual but it will repay your time with great photo and video files. If you are looking for a tiny and simple snapshooting camera you have definitely landed on the wrong page.The camera is a solid value and something I wanted the minute I read the first press releases about it. If you want to read more about my early experiences with the camera please look for my author's page here on Amazon under my user name. There is a feed from my blog and the entries from May 4th and 5th are the ones cogent to this camera.The images above are handheld and shot from exactly the same location. The first wide shot is the widest focal length while the second image is a shot at the longest end. The image quality delivered at the long end reaffirms the Zeiss reputation. It's a great overall system.",1

It comes with neither.  As purchased you can only charge the battery in the camera tethered to a short cable plugged into the wall.  This puts your camera out of action and an opportunity to step on it in a hotel room.  The manual that comes with the camera is like knowing all the bones in the body without any idea how they go together.  The full manual is far more informative.This obviously is not a pocket size travel camera.  But if you've given up carrying a full size DSLR camera and lenses on travel this camera is a happy compromise.  The new 1 inch sensors take remarkably good pictures and the reach of a 600mm lens gives you the shots you might otherwise miss or be too small to be useful.  Yes the pros tell you to move closer to your subjects to get the shot.  Try doing that in a country where people don't like having their pictures taken.  With the reach of a 600mm lens you can shoot across the town square and if your subject notices and isn't happy at least you'll have a good head start. Likewise this camera does reasonably well with wildlife if sometimes a little slow in focusing. Video is excellent although I have not used it for more that a few minutes at a time.You can use this camera in point and shoot mode but presumably if you're looking at this camera you know about all the other DSLR-like functions it has all of which work very well.  Many reviews cite this camera's ""confusing"" menus.  I found the logic of the menus fairly straight- forward and easy to navigate.  The two function buttons can also be easily customized allowing immediate call up covering almost all travel situations. The panorama mode on this camera actually works but takes some practice to get right.For travel this camera is pretty easy to live with.  Weather sealing is a huge plus especially in dusty or damp environments.  Because it is a relatively heavy camera that you mostly carry around your neck I'd also suggest getting a padded strap to replace the the fairly narrow nylon strap that comes with the camera.  The body and lens are reasonably sturdy and will take the occasional hit without damage. But it is certainly not a ruggedized camera.  I found I get close to the advertised 420 shots before replacing the battery.  Buying a second carry-along battery is strongly suggested.In sum this camera won't fit in your pocket but does a good job of replacing a DSLR camera for lighter travel.",0

I've been a fan of SLR and DSLR cameras for almost fifty years and I love the flexibility of being able to get a lens that is ideal for every situation I might encounter and even use it without a lens on microscopes and telescopes.  What attracted me to this camera was its high frame rate- up to 1000 frames a second for slow motion videos.Somewhat to my surprise it is also a great general purpose camera and I find myself using it in place of my DSLR a lot of the time.  The astonishing range of the zoom lens surpasses my DSLR lenses and the picture quality is just as good.  The image stabilization is also excellent- again better than my DSLR.  I couldn't imagine being able to hand hold a camera at equivalent 600mm FL yet this camera does it with ease.This camera is also smarter than any camera I have owned which is both good and bad.  If you snatch it up to capture a fleeting event it usually does a good job but when I want something specific it often seems to think it knows better- not always correctly.I had been warned that this camera has poor documentation and user interface but I was still surprised at how bad it was.  If you want to use the enormous range of capabilities that the camera provides be prepared to spend lots of time experimenting searching and learning.  I got the Kindle edition ""Photographer's Guide to the Sony RX10 III: Getting the Most from Sony's Advanced Digital Camera"" by Alexander White and it does a good job of getting you started.The camera is big and heavy which makes it easy to hold and keep it steady.  It also provides space for the numerous dials and controls- some of which can even be customized- when you have spent the requisite hours learning how to do so.This definitely isn't the ideal camera for everyone but I am finding that I like it more and more.",0

Images were spectacular zoom range was incredible albeit slow electronic zoom to get from wide to tele.  The 4K video was sharp and smooth best I have ever used the slow motion capabilities were mind blowing although I was not a skilled user it could prove a great tool.My only complaint was AF speed and shutter response it is painfully slow compared to my Micro four thirds system I was hoping to replace.  And even slower compared to a DSLR from the the past few years.  If you are coming from a bridge camera or a smaller point and shoot this may be an improvement for you but this will not replace a MILC or DSLR for any moving subjects or active wildlife uses.,0

This is the best ""all in one"" camera on the market right now. The improved image sensor in this model provides stunning image quality and excellent 4K video clips. I had the original RX10 and really liked that camera. However this latest model blows the original away in mage quality and lens performance. The 24 - 600 zoom has an incredible focal length range that allows for detailed close ups from quite a distance. The images have excellent color dynamic range and contrast straight out of the camera. The camera is pretty easy to set up. The price is on the high side but the image quality is almost equal to my 4 year old full frame Canon DSLR. The only downside is that you can not make deep crops of the photos you take the picture quality goes down in a hurry. But if you don't crop your images the quality is awesome.I highly recommend this camera for all forms of general photography especially if you need extreme telephoto coverage. This would make a great wildlife and birding camera without getting into the expense of a DSLR. I recently returned from an awesome trip out of the country and came back with photographs of a quality that previously would only be available hauling a full frame DSLR around.",0

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01DLLJ8CU,Sony DSC-RX10 III Cyber-shot Digital…,        6 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Beware of reviews on the RX10iii and FZ/2000 --- After Follow-up: Wonderful Camera  December 28  2016By Kimball Corson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I researched this camera and the Panasonic FZ2000/2500 thoroughly before I bought this one in an open box sale from Best Buy which forgot to include the AC charger and cord but is working on it. I have only had the camera for a day and on it for now will only say 1) the few photos I have taken under adverse conditions have excellent IQ (much better than I expected) and 2) it is heavy so how you hold it must change as the zoom lens extends. I am learning. It is the reviews of the FZ2000 and Rx10iii which concern me. Only Photoreview out of Australia bothered to provide standardized Imatest resolution and noise test results for it and the FZ2000. There it was no contest. The RX10iii won hands down on both notwithstanding the reviewer's rather biased conclusions on IQ. Then read the comparatively lackluster reviews on IQ of the FZ2000 on the B&H Photo site and the CameraLabs site. Also my own experience with Panasonic optics has been lackluster IQ with the FZ70/72 and the FZ200 as well as many smaller zooms. Finally the reviewers of the two cameras spend most of their time describing the cameras' features and saying too little about IQ in a way they back up. Many complain about the Sony's menu system which contrary to them is not a mess but makes most features of the camera accessible by the push of a button if you have the intelligence to figure out how to so set it up. In that regard I found Alexander White's book on the RX10iii cheap in the Kindle version and truly excellent. Other reviewers test for noise but not IQ at many focal lengths. Many clearly do not have a handle on how to operate the camera well. Conclusion: beware of the reviews but read them all. I will comment more on the camera and my use of it later.Follow up: Much better than I expectedIQ is better than Nikon D5300 and D7100 with upgraded lenses on JPEG's. Still haven't tried RAW yet. Smaller than expected but not small. About same size as bulky lensed D7200. But really heavier than expected. Far fewer focusing problems than expected; essentially none. Easy and simple to use; hard and complex to set up correctly. Must learn the manual. Alexander White's book on Amazon is excellent help. Stabilization is much better than on Nikon VR and VRII lenses. Product is pricey.  Highly recommended for all in one camera. The Zeiss lens is a masterpiece of optical engineering. Moon shots taken below were hand held at 1680mm (optical + smart zoom) with 70% enlargements. Unbelieveable for a 24 to 600 optical zoom lens that is excellent throughout its range,1

I never pre-order cameras but when I read the specs on this a few months ago I decided to risk it.  The elements that caught my eye were: electronic viewfinder purported low-light sensitivity 30X zoom and integration with smartphone.I'd characterize myself as an advanced amateur user.  Meaning I like to learn all the functions and play with different features and mode.I've also been disappointed many times by cameras with poor low-light performance and poor focusing so those are particularly important to me.Having said that here's my review after 2 days of using.Interface:  I've used Panasonics before so switching to a Sony took a while to get used to.  There are lots of rings and dials and very tiny buttons.  If you have fat fingers don't get this camera. My fingers are average for a guy and I do have to be careful where I press.  If you leave settings on full auto of course you don't need to use buttons but if you want to control a lot of settings then you do.  One nice positive is the big control ring around the lens.  It can be used to adjust shutter speed and aperture.Viewfinder:  You have to manually pop up the viewfinder with a tiny slider.  I'm somewhat nearsighted (-1.50) but the diopter adjustment was easy and I have no problem seeing perfectly clear through it.  The viewfinder is high enough resolution that I can actually see that the image is focused.  Lots of information is also presented in the display.Display:  The main display is great and I like the fact that it can pivot 180 degrees up to do selfies and also is good for taking pictures close to the ground.  It also can display whether the camera is level which is great for shooting landscapes with horizons.  It is also good enough in bright sunlight though in such situations I do prefer the viewfinder.Low light:  Low light performance is above par for a camera with such a small sensor. Sony has a nice feature where it will take multiple fast exposures and blend them together to achieve a low-noise yet non-blurry low light image.  I've included an example of that.Zoom:  the 30X optical zoom is amazing.  I've include pictures comparing full-wide to full-zoom.  On other 30X cameras I've tried the long end of the range is almost always unusably blurry. With this camera it is quite acceptable and even impressive from the samples I've uploaded.Dynamic range:  The camera has 3 modes - regular mode expanded dynamic range mode and HDR.  Photos with HDR do look a bit odd but the camera does a great job of blending multiple shots together without blurring.  I didn't spend a lot of time playing with these modes but most people will leave it on the expanded dynamic range mode and let the camera decide when to activate HDR and by how much.Video:  The camera promises 5-axis stabilization.  It does work quite well as my hands have tremors and I'm usually disappointed with handheld videos from my smartphone and previous cameras.  I shot a video rapidly changing subjects far and near and moving the zoom a lot and the camera kept up the whole time without doing that annoying ""focus search"" that other cameras seem to do whenever the subject changes.  I'd give it high marks for being intelligent.Conclusion:  I wanted a great pocket-sized camera that works for travel indoor parties and some fine photography such as flowers landscapes and portraits.  I believe I've found the camera with the best of all worlds without excessive compromise.  Would I get better images from a 1"" sensor?  Probably but then I'd sacrifice the zoom.  If I were to have just one camera this would be it.",1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00VWJOK7M,Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera with…,        19 of 19 people found the following review helpful       An interesting improvement over previous models  August 2  2015By A. Morales,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been the previous owner of the Sony HX series of point and shoots including the 20v 30v and the 50v. While all of them had their strong points and weak points the HX90v has improved its strong points even further while some of the weak points still plague the small sensor. Sony has reduced the number of megapixels from 20 down to 18 improving its signal to noise and dynamic range. You can now do exposure bracketing from +/-3EV where before it was +/-1EV. This opens up a higher dynamic range shooting exposure bracketed images for HDRs. The camera also has an auto-HDR feature which will take three shots for you at the exposure range you set and process it into an exposure balanced image which of course retains you shadow and highlight details. The camera has also been reduced in size but has has new features added such as a popup EVF and a flip up rear LED display for those selfie moments.  It is a marvel of engineering to pack so many features into such a small camera. It also features a movable lens ring that will give you better control over zooming in or out of your scene. Like I mentioned before the small sensor still has problems with noise at higher ISO ranges above 800. Navigating the menu to get at certain features is complex but has a lot of customizations that could be useful. The popup EVF was clearer than I expected from such a small display but totally adequate for shooting in bright sunlight where the main display is totally washed out by the sun. I would have preferred to have had the rear display be able to tilt up or down rather than just flip up. Like the 60v this camera can also accommodate PlayMemories applications which adds more capabilities and automation to help process and/or shoot your photos. You have the ability to wirelessly transfer your images to your smartphone of computer as well as being able to remote control the camera from your PlayMemories Mobile app including settings zoom and remote viewing of the scene before triggering the shutter from your smartphone. The only downside to the apps is that Sony has not updated all their apps to accommodate the HX90v yet.All in all it is s great improvement over the previous models and I look forward into using it a lot more for those times that I don't want to lug my big DSLR around.,1

The following review (after this one) is about the latter.That said I am happy with the great zoom ability of 30X - about dectuple that of the 1"" sensor model. It is of course a tradeoff (in a 'lower CyberShot league') with a small 1/2.3"" size but surprisingly in spite of such differences the quality of photography is near that of that other model. Noise reduction is appropriate and does really well on the 18 megapixels something that all other compact 'super-zoom' cameras come nowhere close.Pros:+ Great for distance photography such as wildlife on the lake lunar shots - even at night.+ Decent video quality during the day and zooming is very fast (default setting is normal).+ Unlike the DSC-HX60V model the new 50 mbps codec is available but you must have a supported card. (See cons.)+ Half the price of the DSC-RX100 IV (much better overall value).* Fits easily in even a shirt pocket.* Better battery life than on the DSC-RX100 IV (this is obviously due to processing requirements so this con is acceptable given the laws of the camera's physics).* Excellent focusing ability and accuracy (still a problem on all RX100 models).* Oustanding photo quality found on the DSC-HX60V (even though that model is 20 megapixels).Cons:- Poor video performance in low-light because of the f3.5 aperture (again a tradeoff with the extreme zoom and small sensor size).- Cannot record 4K (this is actually UHD - 4K is true on another camera such as Panasonic GH4).- Cannot take still photos during movie-recording as on the DSC-RX100 IV (does not have the new DRAM chip; stacked sensor).- Flash barely tilts enough for even flash lighting as on DSC-RX100 IV.- Viewfinder needs pulled out after ejection-up unlike DSC-RX100 IV (the image size is far too tiny; you do not even need to do this on that other model).- Must choose high display quality to see WYSIWYG results in photos and videos (this is misleading because the concept is like preview quality over actual render quality in a video editor on a computer).- Very low aperture of f3.5 at wide angle at night (for example clouds passing by stargazing and so forth).- No internal memory (even Panasonic no longer includes it in their upscale cameras) and no memory card; same with the other model.- No still capture during movie-recording.- Need specific card class to shoot in the new 50 mbps movie-record setting (this is not a requirement on Panasonic DMC-FZ1000 even though it caused a rare malfunction yesterday afternoon).- No UHD recording support but a camera of this type would not be powerful enough anyway.I really like this camera and recommend it over the DSC-RX100 IV if you do not do much night videography do not need advanced video capabilities and need great photo quality. Distance shots are the strongest selling point for me on this camera (whether at a park buildings across a lake amusement park close-ups of roller coaster tracks and so on). Even though it may be great for sports shots at a ballgame it probably won't be ideal for clouds rolling on by at night because the aperture is too small. The price is very attractive too. Given the technical compromises for such a small body and retail value I issue this a 5-star review. Great for what it can do and what it cannot do I have no complaints. In most respects I prefer it over the DSC-RX100 IV for most purposes when best quality and wide-angle-only shots (during the day) are less necessary. Be sure to read my upcoming review on that model if you have not already done so. Thanks for reading and good luck.- Matt Eye",0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00VWJOK7M,Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera with…,        12 of 12 people found the following review helpful       Low Light Auto Mode Differences + Extra Benefits  February 29  2016By CT,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought this DSC-HX90V to replace my old DSC-HX-9V which recently had a scratch on the lens.  I searched and compared among Nikon Panasonic and Sony.Finally I decided to continue with Sony.  I was particularly concerned about some reviewers' comments on poor low light sensitivity but the low light issue was not my prior experience with the 9V model.  So I ordered it anyway. Today I received the HX90V and I am happy about my decision.  I shot at various light levels and tried at different Scene and Auto settings.  I would like to share my observations here:1. Shooting at very dim indoor lights:  It turned photos into very good photos.2. Shooting at objects placed under dinning table with lights dimmed to minimum: got dim photo just light seen by naked eyes.  When the light turned very slightly righter still dim it triggered much brighter photo.  The trigger level is still low light to me.3. I finally found the difference: 90V has two auto settings on the dial:  Intelligent Auto (Green Symbol on dial)) is not as good as Superior Auto (Yellow Symbol).  Superior Auto took a decent photo when Intelligent could not even produce any photo. Also if the Scene (SCN symbol) is set to Steady Night Shot (Half moon with Palm hand) it will take in more lights than other daylight setting.  So by choosing the Steady Night Shot and then also use the Superior Auto  much better low light photos are obtained.4. Other settings that can produce good photos under very low lights: Set dial at A (Aperture Priority) and P (Program Auto).  These two settings will take a picture with one shutter click sound.  The Superior Auto setting will take a photo with several shutter click sounds.Also I just realized another benefit when I searched the Sony web site.  It provides a free download of Play Memories software which is very extensive in the latest edition.  It will be worthwhile for people who may want to try some fancy work on photography or simply organizing the photos on the computer. It search through the hard drive and organize them under one roof..I would give it a 5 stars if it does not have the following minor issues:1. The On-Off button is level with the body and very difficult to find it in the dark.  Wish it can be found more easily if it can be made more obvious when being searched by finger in the dark. Some difference in vertical height or surface texture will be easier to use in the dark.2. The zoom at 30X may lock onto out of focus scene due to hand vibration and then I needed to pull back the zoom and restart the zoom a few times before it will refocus properly.3. The battery compartment door is very difficult to open and close. Wish it is Slide knob is bigger with more friction for easier opening with the finger.4. My old HX9V will display remaining battery power for how many minutes. The HX90V does not display that information.  That information is very useful to let user know how full is the battery and how much longer usage time is available.Overall so far I like it.,0

July 4  2016By james taglienti,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Pros:-Super portable.  It's the size of a pack of cigarettes.-Better photos than expected even in super zoom-Many features of Sony's more expensive cameras-Good battery lifeCons:-Fragile-So small controls are cramped-Not well sealed against dust-Extensive menus can be troublesome-Viewfinder is difficult to use and finickyWe used this camera on a 3 week vacation and took about 4000 photos with it.  It worked well but does have a few issues.The camera takes great JPG photos and has menus and photo effects similar to Sony's DSLR lineup.  Super zoom is reasonably clear and auto features are accurate.  With some Lightroom editing the pictures are far beyond what a smartphone can achieve and honestly better than I had expected to generate.  Slipping it into a pants pocket while on hikes and other activities was a huge bonus.  It was about 2/3 the size I had expected!  The battery life was ample and lasted through over 400 photos using only the LCD screen.  That being said the ""pocket camera"" title is exactly what caused the most headache.  The lens now has 4 large dust particles on the inside which can be seen in some photos.  I think this is from poor sealing and of course being in my pocket for days on end.Also the lcd screen is showing some wear from the same treatment.The biggest upset happened when I managed to turn the camera on while still in my pocket.  The lens extended bound inside my pocket and stripped a few teeth from a gear.  It still works but is noisy during zoom and off/on.  I will have to send it in for service.The viewfinder is difficult to use thankfully the LCD is bright enough for direct sun.  Also I have some skepticism about the long term durability of this camera.  It's almost too tiny for it own good.  If you plan on pocketing this camera you may want to get a clean cloth bag or neoprene sleeve for it to avoid dust invasion.",0

Vogt,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The Sony HX90V offers great functionality and a nice shooting experience but ultimately even considering its sensor size image quality falls short with detail smearing down at the lowest ISOs when blown up to anything larger than web size photos.While I realize that they have decreased the MP slightly on this model I still think 18MP is way too much for a camera with a 1/2.3"" sensor. I kind of feel for an enthusiast-oriented megazoom they should've gone with something like 12MP like Panasonic did for its Lumix ZS50. Detail smearing due to noise reduction is visible at reduced sizes at base ISO. Most pedestrian point and shoot cameras these days should at least be able to give you the ability to blow up your prints at ISO100. RAW capture is also not available on this model which is unfortunate because you can customize the level of noise reduction applied and potentially get better photos than what they out of camera JPEGs display.To balance this out color and exposure are pretty good. The camera doesn't blow out highlights as badly as some of its peers.It's unfortunate that image quality falls short because otherwise this is a nice camera to use. The autofocus is fast and mostly on target. The image stabilization works well. And the viewfinder is actually very nice despite being a lower resolution than the ones found in the RX100 series cameras. Battery life is also pretty good. The LCD screen on back is pretty good as well.I have not shot with the Panasonic ZS50 so I can't really comment on overall image quality compared to this camera but the fact that you can shoot RAW gives it a leg up over the Sony. If you never really blow up your photos at all then this might be an alright choice. But if you at least want to make larger prints from images at base ISO in good light I would look elsewhere.",0

I have a Sony DSLR and 2 previous HX models.First if you are wanting this camera to perform like a DSLR this camera will not do that. It is still a point and shoot with a small sensor. As long as you are aware of this limitation then you will probably be pleasantly surprised. I purchased this camera mainly for use at concerts going to places like Seaworld video recording my daughters dance performances and just general photography. I do have a DSLR but I find that its size and weight prevents me from using it very often. There is nothing wrong with my other HX models but the 30x optical zoom on this camera in a small body was just too much to pass on.My favorite feature of this camera is the control ring. I thought it would be the zoom but it's definitely the control ring. I find myself shooting in S mode quite often at concerts and the control ring allows me to easily and quickly make adjustments in the dark. This is wonderful!!My least favorite feature is how the pop-up viewfinder works. It pops up but then you have to pull part of the eye piece towards you to get it to work. Its a little cumbersome but not terrible.The size is nice. Since this was going to be my main concert camera size was extremely important. Most venues do not allow any camera with a detachable lens or one where the lens extends beyond a certain length. My larger HX (sorry I dont know the model number off the top of my head but its in the ""bridge camera"" size range) would often give me issues. I would have to explain that no the lens does not detach but sometimes they still didn't want to let me in with it. I am confident that I will not have that problem with this camera. I know there are lighter and smaller cameras out there but I'm not sure if any of them pack so much into them. The grip took a little getting used to as the body is slightly different than my other HX model but that was nothing significant. The record button for video recording is in a much better position now and can be found easily in the dark.The menus and scene selections are very intuitive particularly if you have ever used a Sony camera before. The battery life is as expected. I had no problems during a 3 hour concert taking stills and videos about 40% of the time.The picture and video quality was what I would expect from Sony and this type of camera. It works excellent in great lighting struggles a bit in low light. I'm not one of those that zooms in at 100% and looks for purple fringing noise and so forth. I also don't do large prints - 8x10 maximum but mostly 4x6. I found the concert images were better than expected. This is really putting the device to its maximum capabilities. I know I'm not going to get perfect images when you zoom in at 30x optical from really far away. But I could tell who I was taking pictures of and wide angle shots caught some really beautiful mood pictures of the overall stage. I was impressed that the camera was able to capture the colors in almost the same hue as I was seeing with my eyes. I've noticed that at concerts cameras tend to not be able to capture the stage lighting well. Purples come out as blue and so forth. With some experiments with the settings this camera did a pretty decent job.The tilting screen is nice to have on such a small camera. I kind of wish that it rotated in the opposite direction so that you could hold the camera above your head and use the lcd screen but this is a minor issue. It worked well for taking a selfie.Overall I am very pleased with this camera. I would definitely recommend it to others.",0

May 31  2016By Ultraviolet,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought this camera in a hurry after my Olympus OM-D E-M10 broke just before a vacation to India. I could not have made a better choice. First and most important to me image quality of this little camera is amazing. Using the automatic settings it accurately chooses the right focal points exposure resulting in vibrant-colored images. Manual modes are there as well and although they are not as easily controlled as a larger camera they are adequate. One of the best surprises of this camera was the zoom - which is a real tele zoom allowing for some amazing shots of wildlife etc. Low light exposures come out well there is little noise at higher iso settings. Personally I feel the red color is a bit too vibrant but that is easily helped. Camera size is very small and the battery lasts for many exposures. The only negative is maybe the viewfinder which requires two steps to deploy and is fairly hard to use for someone with glasses (I wear glasses and used it regularly but I think I can't see the whole viewfinder due to the extra distance). I used the USB port to charge the camera on the road and it requires a good overnight charge to be completely full.When I received my Olympus back I had to get used to it after using the Sony so intensely and for a while I wasn't sure if I wanted to go back. Of course they are very different cameras but since I travel a lot there have since been many situations where I would have preferred to the smaller Sony despite the lack of pro-style exchangeable lenses.Overall if you are looking for a very compact camera for many different situations (like a vacation) this is an excellent choice.,0

Wilcox,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Before purchasing the HX90V I compared against all similar cameras I was attracted to the WIFI small dimensions zoom EVF Viewfinder the pop up flash the rotating (selfie) LCD screen. Before purchasing I read positive reviews and noted the complaints. I found that this camera may not be right for persons that don't have refined touch or handle items roughly. The pop-up EVF flash and USB port cover could be easily broken if handled roughly. Some buttons are small to locate and feel. I noticed the plastic case comments about the camera. I can't say it would be a problem for longevity but didn't think it has a cheaply made look or feel. Plastic does changes over time and I'm hoping it will give me at least 5 years of service. After some photo taking WIFI connecting and feature tests I found the camera very satisfactory. Regarding accessories I bought the Sony screen protector PCKLM15 and found it easy to install. The Sony fitted case LCJHWA does have a nice quality to it. This light compact camera suits my needs for a camera that is easy to bring along and take nice photos.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01FFACR50,Canon PowerShot SX620 HS (Black),        43 of 45 people found the following review helpful       Bring back the function wheel  Canon!  November 9  2016By Otis Maxwell,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I got this camera to replace my SX-280 which was stolen. Amazon suggested this as the ""newer model"" of the same camera. My two main requirements are shooting pictures for my food blog (Canon's color temperature is just right for this across their product line) and taking movies and telephoto stills of kid sporting events. For the latter it's a plus that the zoom is 25x vs 20x for the 280. (By the way whenever I get a new camera I immediately turn off the digital zoom. You don't need that extra noise in your picture. Just use the optical zoom and if you need to get in closer you can edit your photo after the fact.)The reason this review is three stars is that Canon made the terrible decision to remove the settings wheel on the back of the camera (used to toggle back and forth between auto mode shutter priority aperture priority etc) and move those settings several levels deep on the onscreen functions menu. There's a lot of good stuff there--there is now a fisheye mode for example--but you'll have to shoot with the manual at your side to make use of them. The 280 was a point-and-shoot that had additional functionality readily available if you needed it. This is still a good point and shoot but I am afraid most folks (including me) are not going to make the considerable effort to train themselves in the more complex features.Also I was hoping I would be able to use the wireless which never worked for me on the 280. Unfortunately I am on the Apple platform. There is no software available for my OS (10.11) and the touch-and-transfer technology is for Android only. It would be great to wirelessly send photos to my PC but I can't do that.UPDATE: after spending some time with the manual I discovered that Canon has actually removed the Aperture priority and Shutter priority features entirely. Instead you have to choose one of many special programs such as ""Nighttime Handheld"" which give limited ability to control settings. If you liked the idea of using a very low aperture so only part of your picture is in focus (for example) that's no longer a choice for you.",0

July 5  2016By Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased the SX620 as a pocket camera for special events traveling and so forth. The camera is quite easy to use and provides decent photos with very little effort. For the novice photographer it is a great camera. If you simply need a simple camera for weddings museums galleries parties insurance claims and those sorts of things this is a nice camera to have on hand. The camera is a decent size not too small but also not too large. You can easily carry this camera in a jacket pocket but it might be bulky for trousers. I did purchase an extra battery and extra memory card which both came in useful during a casual day of shooting photos. The camera is still new but I have had Canon cameras for years and count on their reliability and craftsmanship. You do have to get used to the flash not being automatic as the user has to raise the flash manually. The quality of the photographs is great! For the cost to include accessories it is quite a good camera!,0

I did my due diligence and read reviews and researched prior to purchasing this camera and I learned that ALL waterproof cameras should be rinsed thoroughly with fresh water and dried thoroughly prior to opening them to recharge battery etc.  With this in mind we followed those instructions after each underwater use and we had no issues at all with moisture inside the compartments.  In addition to the fresh water rinse and thorough drying we inspected each compartment cover for even the tiniest drop of water or grain of sand prior to opening.  A couple of times we did see a tiny drop of water or a grain of sand and we removed them and dried again (even waiting several hours for extra insurance) prior to opening.  This seemed to work as we used the camera daily for 7 days in the Virgin Islands and used it underwater on three different snorkeling excursions.  It took great underwater photos and we are very pleased with the camera.  Just be sure to follow all instructions and don't open compartments without a fresh water rinse and making sure absolutely no moisture around compartment openings or on seals.  Attached are just three of the several dozen under water photos we took.  By the way for accurate underwater color be sure to put camera on underwater setting.,1

September 4  2015By jonas rejda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a solid performer. It's real strengths are not so much on land but underwater. Shore performance is acceptable but there are much better options if you are looking for a land only point and shoot. I used it over three months as my dive camera. It fits nicely in the pocket of a BCD. The quality of the images particularly macro is very good for the price range. It is important to learn how to set the white balance by evaluating something white like a dive slate every 3 to 4 meters to get accurate colors. Following this advice the quality of the shots can be extremely high. Warning: If you compare your images to a G16 with housing or similar...you will see a difference. This camera can not do much higher priced options can do but if you are a casual photographer then it will do the trick. It is much better than a GoPro in my experience.A few words on the depth ratings. The camera works fine up to 25m depths. Beyond this at about 28m it becomes unresponsive as it should. I took the camera to 30+ meters on many occasions sometimes it just stayed in my BCD pocket and other times I attempted to test it. It would power up but just display a countdown timer and was non functional. No surpise here. When I returned to 25m is worked perfectly again on the same dive. So this is a real bonus. I even took to to 42.5 m on on dive and it continued to work fine once I returned to 25m and also on shore. It is a great deal at 300 bucks and a solid performer. Plus it is so nice to have a camera that you can stash away and use or not use on a dive without the hassle of carrying around a bunch of excess gear to look after. For people who dive and wnat to take a few images and HD videos along the way = yes. Professionals who truly want professional quality images from their dives.....move up into the $1000 plus price range.,1

I have been using a 5 year old Canon Powershot with water housing to take underwater photo so D30 is a real step up.  I have an older Nikon DSLR for photo on land so D30 gave me HD Video and better MP.Transitioning out of water (beach snorkeling or pictures on dive boat etc.) and having to wipe the water off the glass covering the lenses is an annoyance when you have no access to dry towel.  Some reviews mentioned using Rain-X I wonder if that worked.On the last day of my trip the camera took in moisture and fogged up the LCD display.  It seems the water leaked in from the HDMI door on the side of the camera NOT the SD card and battery door. So at least it didn't fry the camera or damage the SD.  I only open that door once when I received the camera and I had no issues in 10 meter salt or fresh water scuba dive.  It only leaked in shallow water.  I was able to ""dry"" the moisture by opening both doors and put the camera under the sun and let the moisture evaporate and the camera seems to work... I am leaning towards returning this within Amazon's return window and get a new one in case this is a lemon.",0

I was hoping it would be a good point-and-shoot for above water use as well but I'm very disappointed with the photos. Maybe because of its waterproof nature and having to have a glass over the lens most shots look like they were taken through a window with some odd light effects at times. Resolution seems compromised and the images are fairly noisy. I think my Samsung Galaxy S5 android phone takes better land-based pictures!I will still use this for underwater photos which I haven't had a chance to put to the test yet but for above water I say you'll still need a different camera and now I have to spend more to get one. How its quality compares to other waterproof point-and-shoots I can't saysince this is my first but if you think it can ""do it all"" and you're somewhat discerning of photo quality you may be as disappointed as I am.",1

Keep in mind this is only the second time I have used this camera. I took just a few pictures and the LCD screen went black. I couldn't see what I was shooting which made the camera useless. I did get a few pictures by just blindly pointing the camera. But it was a big disappointment.  When I came home I opened the compartments expecting to find water but all the compartments were dry. I turned the camera over and water came out the disp. button. I have mailed the camera to the repair center and I will see what happens. I won't purchase another camera like this ever again. It wasn't an expensive camera but way too expensive for having been used only twice and getting just a few pictures.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00I58LNF0,Canon PowerShot D30 Waterproof Digital…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Indestructible  worth every cent  June 7  2015By Bill W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Have had nothing but good experiences with the D30 an upgrade from the D10 I bought in 2009. Better zoom much thinner profile grat photos. I like the new GPS tagging it comes in handy (turing GPS and tagging on an off is a bit clumsy but not awful). If it is anything like the D10 (still running) this camera is indestructible. Most of the poor reviews of the D-series are about waterproof failure; this is likely due to operator error- failure to make sure the doors are clicked shut and the gaskets are totally clean- all gaskets will leak if they have sand in them.,0

March 22  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought this camera to take snorkeling to the Galapagos Islands. I got a great pic of a hammer head shark! Camera worked superbly no problem with water getting inside. I rinsed it off with fresh water after each use as recommended and  gave it a good thorough cleaning when I returned home from my trip. This camera is very simple to use. I loved the slow motion video feature available on this camera for under water filming.  This camera is also great to use on the beach since you don't have to worry about it getting wet.  So happy I decided to purchase this camera.  I will be using it for future trips.,1

We took about 600 photos and almost all of them came out very well. We let the kids take the camera underwater in the pool and they had a great time taking underwater photos. I have other Canon point and shoot cameras so the settings were very familiar to me. The underwater setting does a good job of adjusting the color. However if you forget to change the setting when you are not underwater the photos all had a redish tint. I checked for leaks throughout the trip and inside of the camera was always well sealed and dry. Very happy we purchased this camera.,0

Battery lasted a long time.  Underwater videos were pretty good quality.  The photos were ok but not that great.One thing to note - most cameras have the lense in the middle.  Because the lense on this camera  is in the corner you need to adjust how you are taking pictures.I always found small drops of water when I opened the seals to access the battery or to plug in the USB cord to download the pictures to a computer.  I dont know if water was getting into the camero or the water gets into a portion of the seal and when you open the seal it gets into the camera.  Once I opened the seal I left the seal open so that it was completely dry before I closed up the seal.,0

Thomas,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I had to return this as soon as I received it. Everything about it appeared really great as most people had reviewed it. But when I tried to take sample shots I noticed that the view of everything in the view finder was very dark. (I tested it first inside my house which during the day is still fairly bright). The image also came out fairly dark especially if I then  tried to do a video. With all of the specs that I thought I had checked  thoroughly I neglected to pay attention to the largest f stop...it was 4! I have had a number of point and shoot cameras with the Sony Cybershot  being among my most favorite and they all have much wider f stops and take great photos inside with average inside lighting. I am going to the Galapagos Islands and wanted a convenient  underwater camera and needed to replace my regular cameras for this trip. As soon as you are in an environment that is less than optimum lighting you are in trouble with higher ISOs grain and getting a poor image unless you flash. You can imagine how difficult it is to get shots with this if you then try to zoom in on a shot which reduces the f stop even more. Since lighting underwater is at a premium this slow f stop essentially makes this underwater camera unusable. I was so disappointed. Amazon was great about the return (as usual) and it only cost me a $5 reshipping charge by UPS (it had lithium batteries in the shipping),0

I followed all the suggestions the support team gives me but until now no results at all. I really do not know what to do because at the end neither the support team helps me. They have been giving me the same answers they gave me in previous emails and until now I don't know if its a hardware problem of the camera a software problem of the application or a problem with the cube (that seems that it works satisfactory). A serious company would have suggested to return immediately the product. After all these weeks that have past and if i was not in Greece I would do it immediately.As for the camera I cannot give my true opinion because until now it does not work properly.,0

Love it !!!I love the fact that I can remotely monitor my home without monthly fees. I added a couple of iSmartalarm KEEP cameras for monitoring large open areas. I get such piece of mind from a quick visual of the house when away. Why the Spot ?  I have a mechanical room that contains a Geothermal system. There is a PSI gauge that needs to stay above a certain psi. When away my son volunteered to stop by and monitor the gauge. A hassle for him. Then I read about the Spot - perfect solution !!! I ordered a smart switch along with the Spot. Now I can turn on a lamp in the mechanical room remotely and visually monitor the psi gauge to get a status. I can then take action only when I need to. Perfect solution for me.,0

Morgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,At first I had issues with the camera but figured it out all without reading a thing. Yes it was both simple and complex at the same time. A little playing around in the app will get you a long way! Reading the instructions though may actually help as well.Do I like it? I love the motion and sound alerts. I love that is is capable of recording clips when motion is sensed. I love that I can and have inserted a card into it and I am using it to take time lapse video of the day while i am away. The time lapse has even let me see and know that the ChemLawn guy isn't really treating the entire yard but just spots here and there - as i had thought. Too bad for him. Time to call the boss and complain again about the service.I liked this camera so much I went out to bestbuy and purchased their alarm system. The ones at bestbuy are a little differently packaged in that their system includes a spot camera. Now i have two of them and an alarm. A review for the alarm will be forthcoming and if the interaction of the camera and alarm causes any issues I'll be back here to update this review of the spot camera.,0

November 27  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After the considerable issues I had with the iCamera keep (wouldn't stay connected to Wi-Fi never connected to live view!) I didn't have high hopes for Spot. I was wrong.Super easy to setup was up and running within a few minutes with zero connection issues. This little camera has restored my faith in iSmart alarm.The video quality is acceptable at 720p but where it really shines is with the night vision. I wasn't expecting much but I was blown away at how clear everything was in total darkness.As others have mentioned the audio is a little annoying because you have to switch back and forth between talking and listening within the app but really are you expecting to have a full on conversation with a thief or your pet? I can live it.To anyone debating between the spot or the iCamera? Save your money and go with spot!!,0

As a result they are only really useful if I'm in my house which makes no sense for a security system.

When I came home dinner was ready in 15 min- not 45.  Double score!Honestly it's really cool. There's night vision speaking and listening functions you can take photos and you can inset a micro disc. The fact that this is all done wirelessly and the feed is through my phone is huge. I currently have two cameras and am going to buy two more. The fact I can check to make sure my family is safe and also when we are away that the pets are good is so comforting!!,1

This camera works great but doesn't alarm very far from the camera.  We placed this camera near the inside man door and it doesn't pick up movement from the garage door opening or the side walk thru.  It only alerts if someone walks over by the inside door.  The picture quality is great. The speaker is really quiet so you really can't talk to a person via the camera.  We are still debating whether to buy more for our other inside door.,0

Good quality video & time laps photos. Night vision works great too! I did take off 1 star because it's not water proof (so it can't stay outside) it does work through a window make sure you have night vision off if you place the camera against glass because the red light will make your video solid gray. Against a window w/the outdoor lights on works great for night viewing. I'm happy with it & I purchased a 2nd camera shortly after receiving the 1st because I like it so much.,0

Seaman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was looking for a waterproof camera to take on the family vacation that I could reuse (ie. not a disposable). I figured I'd give this one a try since it was only $80 digital took still pictures and video and the dual display feature seemed neat. I got this with Prime shipping with enough time to test it out before vacation. Note: the batteries and microSD card do not come with the camera as it states. So if you do purchase this also get the microSD card. Amazon packaged it with the SanDisk. I got a 32G microSD card for $13. That was cheaper than other vendors I checked out.I tested it in the pool with my daughter and took video and pictures. I attached a picture here's the video link https://youtu.be/jnU55pOE6f4. It was pretty good quality for the price paid. I didn't want to pay $$$ for a GoCam or equivalent so for $80 I'm really happy with my purchase. Other reviewers thought less of the item but perhaps they just got a bad one. IMO I'm happy I got this for vacation. By the way my daughter dropped this several times already and it is pretty rugged.,1

July 10  2015By Lisa Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I wanted a waterproof camera to use on a vacation to Mexico. We knew we would snorkel and such so I wanted something cheaper we could use for that.This camera turned out to be awesome for us. It is exactly what it says. We took many pictures above and below the water with this and nearly all turned out great.Understanding a cameras limits on power we did purchase lithium batteries for it as designed. We took 160 pictures (all in high sunlight so no flash was used) but we still had 3/4 left on the batteries. I never changed them out on our 10 day trip and still have plenty left. I have no problem opening the door i just read the instructions. push the lock while sliding. Opened right up and we were set.All in all please let me say this this camera took our 10th anniversary pictures and these were the best of the bunch because we took them in and on the water where we could not take our other camera and you cant tell the difference between the two when we look at them on the PC.,0

August 20  2015By MemoriesMummiesMéxico,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I like the camera and it takes decent pictures and video but it has some drawbacks. I gave it the H20 test in Puerto Rico recently while snorkeling and it came through for me. I have pictures and video that I wouldn't have had without the Ivation or one of the disposable underwater cameras sold on the boat. It's solidly built and the 20MP images are huge.The drawbacks:1) The battery compartment is the dickens to get open. I know the seal has to be tight for the integrity of the camera but it's a real challenge to open the thing.2) The design is lacking in that you can't plug in the USB cable in to transfer pictures and video because the mini SD card doesn't click into its slot and stay seated. You have to have the battery compartment closed for the card to work properly. With the door closed you can't plug in the cord. Catch-22.3) Making a video isn't intuitive. You have to hold the ""M"" button down at the same time as the shutter button to shoot video. Figured that one out at the dock while waiting to shove off since I'd forgotten the QuickStart guide and searching online for a manual proved fruitless.4) The selfie screen on the front of the camera is a nice idea but the lens doesn't have a wide enough angle for good pictures.5) There's no auto-focus when you press the shutter halfway down like you find on most digital cameras.With all that it's a decent camera would likely buy it again. Caveat emptor.",1

So after a lot of researching we decided to give this camera a try despite our reservations about the low price and name we had never heard of.  This was a mistake.  Here are a few pros and cons to sum up our experience with this camera :Pros- Looks good- Selfie option is nice- Most controls were pretty user friendly- Decent pictures not great but not terribleCons- Battery/MicroSD/USB compartment are all under the same cover so when you open it to upload your photos the batteries fall out- Flash has to charge EVERY time you want to use it.  We were in a dark area and every time I tried to take a picture with the flash I had to wait 5-10 seconds for the flash to charge and every time I missed the shot or got someone right in the eyes with the flash because it doesn't tell you when it's charged you click to take the picture and get the 'flash is charging' message.- The videos are recorded in .avi format and Macs don't recognize this format.  And even my husband's Windows PC kept saying the files were corrupted & had difficulty with playback.- Once you enter Playback mode you can't easily switch back to taking pictures you have to turn the camera off and back on again to take a picture.All in all this camera has potential.  If the manufacturer can make a few small improvements it would be well worth the $80 on Amazon.  Personally I wanted more and there were too many little things that bothered me so I'm sending this one back and continuing my search for a Waterproof camera.,0

Those reviews did not show any photos of the camera taking any photos under water only that it takes okay pictures or that the battery compartment where the ""micro SD"" goes is hard to open.Well they are correct.  The camera has some limitations to what it can do.  Remember your not buying a high end camera only a cheap version of a camera that takes pictures under water.  If you want amazing photos or videos get a GoPro or higher end underwater camera and spend the money.For this camera the picture quality was good if you did not zoom way out on it to infinity.  Zooming to far with this camera gave you less than a quality picture.Now for the reason you bought the camera.  The product review from the manufacture said the camera will work about 10' feet under water.  Well for me I find that a no sale because I was taking a trip that I needed a camera to work at a further depth then that.  Well I took a chance on the camera since it was priced so cheap and would not be a big deal if it didn't work (money is still important for me since it does not grow on trees).  When on my trip and on the sea excursion I took the camera into the water at a depth of over 25' feet.  The camera preformed very will at that depth and I came out with some pretty good pictures.The issue I had and you might have with the camera is it was very hard looking a the screen to see what you were taking a picture of.  What I was taking a picture of was visible in the scree it was just hard to make out details but when I viewed the images after getting out of the water I could see the pictures were there and of what I was pointing the camera at.I did not use the video part of the camera as I did not want run out of battery power while I was in the water because I was in the water well over 20 minutes and did not lose that much battery power just taking pictures.  I did not have the option of leaving the water to get fresh batteries then get back in the water.Now when I viewed the images on my computer later that evening again the images were pretty good.  The images were not the quality you would expect from a say a higher end camera system like the Canon  or Nikon family but the image quality was good.If you are looking at this camera to buy for under water pictures at a cheap price this is a decent camera to have; again for the depth of over 20' feet I was able to take it the picture quality and ease of use.",1

Otherwise a serviceable device for use in harsh conditions.  December 27  2016By Jonah McElroy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Right off the bat it bears mentioning that this camera chews through standard disposable AAAs like my pregnant wife with a tub of Baskin-Robbins.However once I loaded it with a set of 1100mah rechargeable batteries I got a serviceable life out of it though I would advise having spares on hand.The image quality isn't outstanding for all-around use but it shines at its intended purpose underwater photography. Picture quality is good though not outstanding.Durability is a strong point for the unit I gave it to my adorably clumsy 7 year old daughter for photography in our soaking wet Oregon forests. It's been through multiple drops onto dirt rocks and fallen tress with no signs of damage. Holds up to pouring rain well in situations where you wouldn't feel comfortable pulling out a smartphone or point-and-shoot it's a perfect stand-in.The interface is a bit lacking but to be expected for the cost.As far as VIDEO is concerned I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist as the video is low quality with atrocious audio though that's really not the main selling point so it hasn't impacted my use negatively.My daughter loves the front-facing screen for 'selfies' and so do I as it's made her 'selfies' look less ridiculous now that she can see herself.Overall I'd say its worth the eighty or so dollars I bought it for given that it has survived much more than a similarly-priced point an should would have at the trade off of features and image quality.,0

And it is not easy to figure out how to use some of the functions either. If you use the Flash it has to charge first meanwhile Draining your batteries very fast. I had brand new batteries in it and i wanted to use the Flash and by the time the Flash charged Without taking a picture my batteries were already half way Drained. And it will not work without first Purchasing a Micro SD card and Inserting it which by the way is not too easy when i was able to get the Micro SD card in it i kept getting a Card Error on the screen.

June 20  2016By 8ninja,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Although other reviewers have posted about how fragile this item is I ordered it hopeful that my order would arrive in good condition. The product itself was packaged well and I didn't see any viable signs of it being crushed or mishandled. However soon after opening the base of the re device already shows some damages. This makes it pretty much useless as a waterproof device and also guarantees the crack from opening up even more over time.I tried the camera and while I can live with the mediocre picture quality the wifi connectivity is unreliable.I really wanted to love this device and am disappointed by its poor quality. This should never have made it past the production line and any good manufacturing company would have done its due diligence to do some drop tests before it launches to market. I know because I work for a major HW company and we launch products all the time. Suffice it to say I'm not buying another HTC product ever again.,1

With the external battery hanging from a belt loop and the Re connected to that via USB cable the camera can still be used while charging.Another feature I'd sorely like it to have:  a physical on/off switch.  While walking today this damned camera turned itself on and took 260 photos of the inside of my pocket.  The ONLY way to power off the camera is through the software app.  A physical on/off switch somewhere on the camera itself would be very useful.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE:  Sending it back.  The miserable battery life of this camera makes it unusable without a near constant charge and that makes it pointless.  I can only hope that the version 2.x is better w.r.t. both hardware and software.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&The camera itself is ok.  I knew that it had limitations but the form factor and size/weight were big considerations.  Photos are good quality but you have to know when to turn the wide-angle feature on/off.I am thoroughly disappointed though by the software implementation.  (Have tried Android haven't yet tried iOS.)  Things that should work like ""files will transfer when you close the app"" don't.  Settings like ""transfer only when charging"" turned on/off don't seem to have any effect.  Setup connection and re-connection are slow and cumbersome.Biggest gripe:  Failure of the app to use the SD card.  I can't install nor move this app to the SD card and when I do transfer photos via Bluetooth from the camera to my Android 5.x phone it sends them to a predefined folder in my internal memory.  No option for me to change the folder at all!  No option to redirect the photos/videos to the SD card!  My Samsung S5 has 16 gb internal 64 gb MicroSD card.  I discovered this lack of necessary feature when my images quickly filled up my 16 gb internal memory.I will be keeping the camera and using work-arounds like pulling images off the camera via USB cable to my Mac OSX.  But I'm hoping that when the RE v. 2 comes out it comes with more reliable more thoughtfully designed app.",0

It definitely fits a need. It is not a perfect product and a 2.0 version is definitely needed but I am not unhappy with this item by any means.I chose the orange color mainly because it was cheaper and didn't want the white and have to worry about the dirty on the white one. I did get a white one from Best Buy which I returned before buying this one from Amazon. The one from Best Buy did show the crack near the base as others have noted. I believe I may have done this during opening of the package. The packaging is a little hard to figure out at first. Make sure you unscrew the base from underneath before you try to remove the camera. Take a little time twisting the base before removing the camera and don't tear into it like a lion into a gazelle like I did.I love the always on capability of it. Pick it up and shoot no waiting at all. Wide angle is fine the ultra wide angle is really not needed but is an option. The waterproof option is great. Connecting to the app is a little bit of a pain in the ass because you have to switch your wifi to the wifi of the camera in order to transfer the pics to your phone or tablet. A pain but not a deal breaker. One thing I do not like is that the USB cord is only used for charging and not data transfer. So to transfer pics to a computer you need to remove the memory card. The pics are not top quality and you can get better pics with your phone however the benefits of always on waterproof and the wide angle far outweigh any negatives. Its a great camera at a great price. You will not be disappointed. I haven't been.,0

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00NW3AMY6,HTC RE 16.0MP Waterproof Digital…, SECOND CAMERA DEVELOPED CRACKS: Buy the replacement plan  Poor Customer Service!  December 19  2016By Abone52Verified Purchase(What's this?),1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"MY FIRST REVIEW :Had this camera for just over 1 year. When it worked it was great. Unfortunately it was unreliable. About 1 month after using it I began to have issues with the audio. It would stop so I got video without sound. This happened intermittently for a few months. I then returned it to HTC for repair under their warranty. It was replaced and worked fine for a few more months. I also bought the charger base and the additional ""H20 protection cap"". Well it just stopped working and I am 3 weeks out of warranty. This is the second vacation where I have had no images to save. I actually phoned this past weekend while determining that it stopped working while I had the ""H2O"" package on in the wave pool. Their rep told me to call back on Monday and thought since it was just 19 days out of warranty that they would allow me an exception. Well that isn't happening. I told them I noticed a few tiny cracks at the base and probably water entered there. The camera was never dropped so unsure how the cracks developed (maybe while screwing in their H2O protection base?) The replacement was out of warranty as they start from the original purchase regardless that I had the replacement for only 4 months. They were not willing to do anything. So two vacations with lost videos/photos the camera cost plus accessories and they feel that I was fairly treated? They would not even accept it back for repair at my expense.  I even asked who else in upper management I could contact and was told nobody. BEWARE!! As you read others comments you will see that many mention cracks that develop without any dropping of the camera........ maybe something defective?UPDATE: I recently purchased my second RE camera within 14 months. The first one developed 2 small cracks at the bottom of the camera. Suddenly it would not turn on. I noticed these during using it with their extra waterproof accessory cap in a wave pool on vacation. The camera was ruined. HTC refused to help since it was 1 month out of warranty (13 months). They claim that I physically damaged it. The camera has never been dropped. The cracks just developed over time. I researched the camera on Amazon reviews and found others claiming the same thing: cracks developed with no dropping of the camera.I really enjoyed the camera and decided to purchase another. I had already purchased the additional waterproof cap/bottom a case and many memory cards so I thought to give it a try again.  On this purchase I bought the extra warranty.  Well I just came back from vacation and while there I noticed a crack in the SAME AREA. The camera works but after finding the crack I was not about to try it in water. Again I have NOT dropped the camera.HTC appears not to recognize a problem with their product. 2 cameras and similar cracks that others also have reported?? It's about time that they address this and not assume that users  have caused the damage by carelessly dropping the camera.Produce a quality product......SEE THE PHOTOS OF BOTH CAMERAS BELOW..........................................BEWARE!!",1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00NW3AMY6,HTC RE 16.0MP Waterproof Digital…, Simple  easy to use camera good for activities  November 18  2016By Jennifer WingerbergVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,For the price I think this is a great camera for activities. Although I was nervous after reading the reviews that the camera's plastic casing was poor quality mine camera has held up. I have taken this camera tubing biking and snorkeling. The pictures have turned out very nice and clear and the videos are good for capturing the moment. The only disappointmentsI have with the camera is the sound and bluetooth connection. Because of how you hold the camera the sound doesn't really come through clearly or if you're moving there is a lot of static. The wifi/bluetooth connection to my iphone didn't work at all for me unless I was on a secure network. When I was on my last trip I had no way of looking at my photos until I could get access to a computer with an SD reader (luckily I had my micro SD card adapter with me). With that said I am not a technology wiz so maybe it was a user area. Unfortunately I thought disconnecting and reconnecting the camera from my phone would help but then forget that you have to enter a code that's given in the original packaging. Still have not reconnected my camera. Once I can figure out this feature though I think I will use the camera a lot more since I can share pictures or stream live.Again I would definitely recommend this camera as an easy activities camera that's fun to use to capture the moment.,0

December 1  2015By Bigdumptruck,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm having so much fun with this camera! Time lapse is my favorite - I could play with that all day long! I've also used it to do a live feed to YouTube of my birdfeeder. Temps were in the low 40s and it worked like a champ.My wishlist for the camera would be that- I could connect to the camera while on my home WiFi and not have to use cellular data to do live feeds. I can't imagine anyone has the cell bandwidth to do this more than once or twice a month and I think it's a really great concept. Also I sometimes lose my WiFi connection to the camera and it switches back to the my FiOS connection. It's a bit tedious to go back and forth between settings and the camera app to get it reconnected.- When you create a time lapse just back up the final movie not all the individual photos that made up the movie. I filled my iCloud accidentally because I didn't know it was going to do that. I had to turn off the backup function.- Ability to store photos and videos [offline] in the App instead of my photos.,0

Need a steady grip to take a focused shot. Any movement will result in a blurry photo.2. Not enough clear feedback that a photo has been taken - a brighter LED lamp would suffice.3. Better LED signals on the battery life etc would be better. Having to wait for a ""cool down"" period before lifting it up to see the colour of the dim LED is not practical.4. Connection using wifi is troublesome - would be better if the connection were strictly bluetooth.5. Auto photo alignment would be a welcomed feature so that photos taken would not be so skewed.Overall I love this camera and take it everywhere with me. Too bad HTC doesn't seem to be planning on making a better second version.",0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00NW3AMY6,HTC RE 16.0MP Waterproof Digital…, Great Camera Product  Minor Issues  February 14  2016By Caleb L.Verified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My wife purchased this for me for my Christmas present.  I have been testing this extensively over the past few months through several tourist trips and local trips.  First be aware that this product does NOT come with an SD card.  The packaging is amazing it could probably survive an earthquake and still arrive ok.  The design of the camera is simple and intuitive.  I recommend that while you are charging the camera that you download the phone app at the same time.  Once the camera is charged power up the device by grabbing it with your hand and point and shoot away.  The quality is excellent great for trips where you will be outdoors for most of the time since once you grab the picture you can crop and zoom as you want.  The pixels are high quality enough to compensate.I gave this product 4-stars for the following reasons:- No iPad app.  The design of the camera requires Bluetooth AND WIFI to be on.  If you are in a foreign country like me all the time that requires you to rely on WIFI this means you have to disconnect from the Internet and connect to the camera depending on the functionality you are looking for.  Making an app that would allow users to multi-task between devices would relieve the issue- WIFI required. Pursuant to the previous comment why does this camera need Bluetooth AND wifi?- Startup issues.  After the initial power-up instructions tell users that all they need to do is grasp the handle of the camera and it will automatically power on.  Sometimes this works and other times it doesn't.  Also one day I was using the device and the battery died in the afternoon after a full night's charge.  Maybe I powered it on too much? There wasn't much usage between the morning and afternoon so this puzzled me a bit.Other than that this camera is a great buy and if you can deal with comments from strangers about creep shots and the device looking weird this will be a good fit for you!,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DM8R866,Sony DSCRX100M2/B 20.2 MP Cyber-shot…,        466 of 492 people found the following review helpful       Amazing Image Quality  August 1  2013By Pro Photog,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,As a professional photographer who mostly carries a 36 megapixel Nikon D800 SLR I also needed a strong ultra-compact camera for those times when the big camera is just too much or I need to be inconspicuous in my shooting and also for convenient personal/family use. For both uses I find that the RX-100 Model 2 really exceeds all of my expectations.Shortly after receiving it I set up lab tests shooting the same objects at a range of ISO settings using 4 different cameras. I expected the Sony to surpass my older Canon compact which it did easily. The surprise came when I compared the Sony images with my Nikon D7000 SLR itself a very fine camera. The Sony RX100 M2 matched that fine camera at low ISO settings and surpassed it at ISO 1600 and above.This little workhorse also has nearly all the settings one would seek as a serious photographer - 3-frame bracketing manual white balance focus and exposure control aperture and shutter priority 10fps rapid multiple shots and more. Settings are complex though and the manual confusing So while it can behave as a point-and-shoot this camera is best for someone having a good knowledge of sophisticated cameras.I purchased mine with the optional and rather expensive electronic viewfinder that slides into the accessory shoe. It is a great viewfinder and I highly recommend this add-on for those of us who prefer an SLR-like way of holding a camera. And the electronic finder is really better than the usual optical because you are seeing exactly what the sensor sees and there is no mirror slap when you shoot.I don't work much with video but I conducted some tests of this capability anyway - full 1080 at 60P setting. I just went to dinner set the camera on the edge of my table and recorded people coming and going. The results even in the relatively dim restaurant lighting easily exceed my 4-year-old $750 dedicated video camera. The RX200 Model 2 is a winner all around for those who are serious about image quality and features need a pocketable camera and can afford to pay for these capabilities.,0

August 27  2013By A Matthew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Got the camera within 18hrs after ordering it.  That was nice.  I had a lot to learn to be able to get all I wanted out of it.  Played around with it for 2 weeks.  Then took it to a trip to Las Vegas Zion and Bryce National Parks.  Good movie quality.  (Zoom was slow and exposure was a little tricky - in move mode only.)  Surprised by how well soo many pictures came out.  High Rez screen better than most.  Lots of envy from everybody I showed pictures to.  Very pocketable.  Hiked with it in my cargo pockets.  In the end it had scratches and wear all over the body and on the screen.  Had to blow the grit out of the top knob.  The action on the rotating ring on the back is not what it originally was as I used it soo much backing to review pics I had just taken.  I was never silly enough to put this camera in my pocket with keys or coins.  That is just stupid.  In short I used it hard and still very pleased.  I took some incredible pictures of the milky way out in the parks and away from lights.  1.8 3200 ISO and 20 second exposure.  Amazing.  Good low light pics. Fast from off to picture taken.  Missed almost nothing.  Friends couldn't dodge me.  Fast good Auto focus.  The zoom really slows the exposure.  Wish zoom was a more like 5X or 8X.  Panorama function is a little tricky.  HDR is good.  I wish it had more knobs for adjustments.  I'm not a fan of working through menus to do stuff.  Pricy but only the very picky will be disappointed.  But for the size very hard to beat.,0

The lens selection on the a6000 is small and most of the lenses are extremely expensive. With the RX100 M2 you never have to worry about that.So I became frustrated with my a6000 earlier this year- battery life is not what it ought to be and as I said the lens selection leaves much to be desired even though the image quality is very good. I started researching compact point-and-shoots to make it easier to have something other than my iPhone to take pictures with and I came across the RX100 line.Sony sells all four iterations of the RX100 side-by-side and they all have reasons for and against them. As far as I can tell the entire line is uniformly excellent with some obvious compromises given the form factor. Personally I don't think you can go wrong with any of them but after much research I decided upon the RX100 Mark 2. The reasons are as follows:1. Better sensor than M1 (and the same sensor as M3)2. Wi-fi support3. External hot-shoe4. Longer zoom range than M3 or M45. Great price point6. (Supposedly) Better battery life than the other three iterationsOne of the best things about this camera is that image quality is as good as the a6000; despite what many people believe megapixels aren't everything. The RX100 M2 has a 20mp sensor compared to the a6000's 24mp and the images look just about the same. One area where the a6000 is definitely better (with the right lens) is low-light photography. But obviously a compact point-and-shoot is not designed for that (though this one is more capable than most).The downside with the M2 (like the original RX100) is the lack of a viewfinder; if that's something you need go with the M3 because the optional viewfinder for this model will set you back more than if you just buy the next model up. I do find myself missing a viewfinder sometimes but it's not a deal breaker especially as I had read that some reviewers did not care for the pop-up viewfinder on the later models.This is a compact point-and-shoot so be aware that it's probably smaller than you think it is. If you have large hands invest in Sony's optional leather case (which has quite a snazzy retro look btw). Also the image quality is very very good *but* it is in no way comparable to a mid-range or pro DSLR despite the hype. Sometimes the buzz around Sony's cameras is like that surrounding the iPhone cameras; take it with a grain of salt. This camera will never ever replace a DSLR but what it will do is become your high-quality ""walking around""/travel camera.The ability to shoot RAW is frosting on the cake but even if you only shoot JPEG the 1"" sensor really shines.I'll be getting rid of my a6000 soon in favor of something from Nikon but this little camera is staying right where it is- in my jacket pocket.",0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DM8R866,Sony DSCRX100M2/B 20.2 MP Cyber-shot…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Wife loves it  December 28  2015By CJN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My wife loves taking pictures so I decided to get her a really good camera for Christmas. Now I'm not one of those people who knows a lot about cameras so I can't speak to the technical specifications or anything like that. BUT I am one of those people who obsessively reads reviews and does tons of research before pulling the trigger so hopefully this review will help someone like that. Although if you are like me you'll need more than one review to sway you. Anyway here goes.To begin my camera-hunting process I outlined several criteria that the camera had to meet. I listed them below and explained why this particular camera ticked all of the boxes for me.1.) Image quality has to be better than a smartphone. Otherwise why get an additional camera? If the image quality were similar or even only slightly better than her iPhone she'd end up using the iPhone. I guarantee it. So far this camera has delivered. The image quality is incredible. Super sharp professional looking pictures. Wife loves it.2.) Camera has to be small. Small enough to fit in a purse. She's not going to be one of those people who wears a giant DSLR around her neck. When we travel we walk around a lot so a compact camera was key. This camera is a little thicker than a bar of soap. Perfect for throwing in a clutch which is a purse you put inside another purse (or something). Wife loves it.3.) Easy to use. I know my wife won't use it if it's overly complicated or frustrating. She's not a technophobe but she does get very frustrated when things aren't simple. So far this camera has been super simple to use. I mean it's a point and shoot. The auto-focus setting is easy and she's just starting to figure out all the other bells and whistles. All without ever cracking the manual. Wife loves it.4.) WiFi. She likes to share pics on Instagram and Facebook so this was crucial. I originally ordered the RX100 but then returned it for this one. If WiFi isn't that important to you stick with that one. We played around with it a little and the image quality is very similar. If it is important go with this one. Side note: I thought you had to connect both the camera and the phone to your home WiFi to transfer pics but I was mistaken. There is WiFi IN THE CAMERA. So you connect your phone (or laptop or tablet) to the WiFi in the camera. This means you can transfer pics ANYWHERE. This may have been obvious to you but it was a pleasant surprise for me. Sharing is super easy and fast. Again I wanted a camera that made sharing easy. A lot of the WiFi enabled cameras I looked at got poor reviews in that area. Not this one. Wife has been sharing like a champ. Needless to say wife loves it.So if you're looking for a camera that fits any or all of these criteria go ahead and pull the trigger on this one. Or be like me and read a thousand more reviews first.,0

Having owned the DSC-RX100 version 1 and now an owner of V. 3 I'll say this: if you can afford it go for V. 3 if you can't go for V. 1 and wait until V.3 comes down in price!  There wasn't enough of a change between this and the first version to warrant the upgrade in my opinion. Similar features MP rating lens etc.  The viewfinder articulating doesn't make much difference UNTIL you get to V. 3 where they intelligently made it so it flips into a ""selfie mode.""  This is a game-changer as taking self-portraits when you travel becomes quick easy and predictable.  With V.2 the articulating screen is more of a little novelty but not that horribly helpful.In short there's nothing wrong with this camera but there's nothing particularly right.  I returned it shortly after purchase finding it to be a sorry replacement for my (broken) v.1 and instead went with V.3 which is absolutely phenomenal!

Patterson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I do fine art photography and my regular camera is a D800. I got this because I wanted something to carry around all the time not just when I was specifically on a photo shoot. This little thing is impressive not just impressive for its size but just darn impressive. While it doesn't have the flexibility that my bigger DSLR's have when used properly the image quality is absolutely good enough to make big prints that are plenty good enough to show in a gallery.Now for why I didn't give it 5 stars...For the price it's missing a couple of things. I understand why something like the optical viewfinder or the filter adapter would be extra cost accessories although I'm not sure I understand the pricing on the optical viewfinder. But no external battery charger? C'mon...The camera doesn't have enough battery life to last for a full day of shooting. A $750 camera aimed at advanced photographers should have a battery charger so that I can charge one battery while shooting with another.The other thing is the manual. It's a useless pamphlet that doesn't really even cover the main features of the camera properly. The help button on the camera itself is useless as well. For example if I go to the aspect ratio screen and push the help button I get ""sets the aspect ratio."" If that's all the help you're going to provide why bother with the button at all? Message to Sony...a good firmware upgrade for this camera would be to add help button messages that are actually helpful.The last thing is that when I'm using Auto-ISO I can't tell what ISO I'm actually shooting with until after I've taken the shot. The display tells the aperture and shutter speed and that I'm using Auto-ISO but it doesn't tell me which ISO it has chosen. Since I print big I'd like to have some idea how much noise is going to be in the image before I go banging away and shooting a bunch of shots that aren't usable because of ISO noise. UPDATE: A commenter helped me figure this out.  You have to hold the shutter button down halfway then the actual ISO will display. I wish the manual said something about that.UPDATE 2 (Nov. 27 2013): Now that I've had it a month and shot with it a lot I'll add a couple of things. I still give it 4 stars with pretty much the same pluses and minuses. It's small enough that I use it a LOT much more than my D800 because I carry it with me everywhere. The ability to carry it everywhere has opened up whole new areas of photography that I hadn't really explored before. Image quality is still impressive for a compact. The poor manual is still poor. There are still features of the camera that I struggle with like how to make the different autofocus modes work correctly which are not addressed in the ""manual"". The other thing that caught me by surprise is how it behaves when the battery runs out. The display says that the battery is full until it is about to run out. Then pretty much without warning it runs completely dead and stops working usually leaving the lens sticking out and the lens cap open. I've taken to carrying a USB cable in my pack so that I can get enough charge from my laptop to turn the bloody thing off when I run the battery dead.",0

I am by no means a pro just an avid enthusiast.  My passion is the night sky.For that I usually use a Canon 60Da--with lenses not a telescope.  As others have pointed out sometimes less is more and I needed a little ""less"" bulk to do much the same thing.  The Canon is supposed to be used at night not during the day because it has an IR filter modification.  I've been using a Sony HX400V that I really like for daytime shots.I don't want to imply that this camera can replace the Canon 60Da:  the Sony only goes to F11 in aperature; and ISO settings are limited.  However  as I drive around during the day I sometimes spot sites I want to visit at night;  in those cases I'll come back with this little camera and take some quick ""proof"" shots--which tell me in 1 or 2 shots whether this is a good place to shoot at night.  This is very useful and time saving--it's it's no good I haven't dragged out my big Canon or my big tripod.I take a few road trips a year; carrying both the Sony and the Canon; I thought this might be able to replace the larger Sony especially on long road trips;  and also complement the Canon on night sky shots.I'm not giving up the Canon--it has more incremental technical abilities than the RX100 but I wanted to downsize even more from the HX400 and I wanted to be able to shoot in RAW format whenever I could.  So far  I am very impressed.  Because of it's f1.8 and 10.4 lens (in reality) I wondered how well it would do on the night sky even though that was not the reason for buying it. In manual mode on a Bulb setting with a wired remote (yes I have the Smartphone app and it works also) it should work--and it does a good job.One of the night sky issues is focusing in manual mode:  It was easy--very intuitive--much more than my larger Canon.  Very sharp on stars.The camera buttons are small--even for my small hands.  And they are nearly flush with the body.  That is taking some time to get used to.The manual that comes with it is not as helpful as I'd like:  I recommend a book by Alexander White-- ""Photographer's Guide the RX100 II"".  It has been extremely helpful.  For example the RX100 II has a memory recall feature--you set up the camera the way you want it and then you put in Memory.  You dial MR up and pick your setting.  It works very well for me to be able to call up my manual mode on the fly.  And that is but one of the easy to use features.The camera has a small built in flash--don't expect much beyond 8-10 feet for any small camera.  I did some research and the best TTL (through the lens--automatic) add on flash I found was the Neewer 320.  Not as cheap as a manual flash but I wanted the TTL advantage.  Believe it is also sold under other names.  This add on flash provide a little more ""oomph"" in your lighting.  It also works with the Sony HX400 so that was a big plus.There is also a few aftermarket lens kits--Sony makes one as well. That is if you want to add other lenses:  UV CPL ND etc.Surprisingly--this camera doesn't seem to have the ""PlayMemories"" functions that others do. At least I can't find a way to make it work.  When connected to the computer it loads the pictures normally you just can't download apps to the camera.  This surprised me because Sony seems so invested in this product.The Wifi works well -- I have to keep reminding myself that the *camera* generates the wifi signal and the phone connects to the camera.  My phone is used as a hotspot -- in my mind it's the phone generating the wifi.  Once you turn off the mobile hotspot and turn on the phone's wifi connection is no problem.I am using a Sony 128GB SD card in this--putting the card in a PC then using it in the camera seems to give the camera problems.  Not the first time I've seen this with a Sony product.  I transfer all my pictures to an external drive and catalogue them.  Sometimes my Dell PC doesn't read the card.  Right now I'm using a USB card reader and that seems to work on the PC.My camera came with the LCD glass screen attached (I like this).  It also came with a CamRon case which is functional and stylish.  You want to do everything you can to protect your investment.  I wish the camera had a ""LoJack"" application.This is the best point and shoot camera I've ever owned and I intend to keep it for a long time.  I highly recommend this camera.I've provided some images.  If you've never seen what ""processing raw"" can do:  The first four on the golf course I used a tactical flashlight to ""light paint"" as was the street scene with the clouds coming in--processed via PhotoShop Elements 13. The last two pictures are the same exact picture (I mean the exact same photograph):  the next to the last one is the unretouched JPEG  (i shoot RAW and JPEG -- this creates two files; and the last one is the JPEG created from the RAW image in PhotoShop Elements 13.  The streak in the sky is an airplane--but you couldn't see it until it was processed.",1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DM8R866,Sony DSCRX100M2/B 20.2 MP Cyber-shot…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       One of the best compact cameras on the market  June 5  2014By Lunatique,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I had the chance to test the RX100 Mark II agains the Canon G1X Mark II and as soon I started using the RX100 Mark II I understood why it's gained so much attention. It is a really nice little compact camera with excellent image quality faster AF and shot-to-shot speed than the G1X MKII.The faster AF can be a bit deceiving though since whenever it feels challenged by the scene it has to focus instead of trying to lock focus on a small spot it just increases the focus area by a huge amount and does a general large area focus which isn't as precise and you can end up with your intended focal area slightly out of focus.I liked the menu design better than the G1X Mark II with more tabs instead of extremely long scrolling list. The number of buttons and dials and customizability is very similar between the two cameras.While the size of the RX100 Mark II is actually pocketable like I already mentioned I have no need or desire to pocket an electronic device -- I much rather use a shoulder-sling pouch. There are a lot of people who do want to pocket their electronic devices though so its small size is one of its most attractive points.The image quality on this little guy is so nice that it competes favorably against the G1X MKII. The images have less noise but the difference isn't as meaningful to me since a little noise reduction evens results. You won't get the same level of DOF control though and for some people this is a deal breaker.The other possible deal breaker is the lack of a touchscreen and touch-focus/shutter. The face-recognition helps a lot but when it failed I really wished it had touchscreen shooting. Again the old focus and then recompose or moving the AF point around with physical controls just doesn't cut it anymore when we now have superior methods.For those who don't care about the possible deal breakers of the RX100 Mark II I would recommend it over the G1X Mark II.(And now that RX100 Mark III is out it's an even better camera than Mark II with a built-in EVF. But unfortunately still no touchscreen shooting and it's still an 1"" sensor.)If you want to read my review of the G1X Mark II it's here:http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H83DLB5CIXDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I58M1VKBTW I ended up choosing the Olympus OM-D E-M1 over the RX100 Mark II and G1X Mark II.

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00DM8R866,Sony DSCRX100M2/B 20.2 MP Cyber-shot…,"        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       The Sony DSCRX100 is the ""killer app"" of P&S travel cameras. A Mini-NEX.  October 30  2016By APC Reviews",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The Sony DSCRX100M2 has hit a home run with me for traveling light while not giving up any picture quality. I am a long time fan and user of Sony NEX/alpha mirror-less cameras that I will refer to as ""NEX"" from here on to avoid confusion. Over the years I have owned NEX-3 NEX-5n NEX-7 and a6000 bodies and a wide range of Sony E-Lenses. But as wonderful as the NEX camera bodies have been as compact and easy to carry as they are you still have to mount normal sized lenses to them. That hasn't really been a problem. But I have longed for an NEX type camera that I could tote in a pocket or bag like a point and shoot. So the Sony DSCRX100M2 and its 20.9 MP 1"" Exmor R CMOS sensor was both on my must have list and also something that I was eager to test relative to my past and present NEX/alpha APS-C camera bodies.To start with the Sony DSCRX100M2 really is like mini-NEX camera slightly smaller than the original NEX-3 while being quite a bit smaller than the a6000 type camera bodies. The finish heft and feel are all inspire confidence. I was delighted to find that the user interface was with a few small changes basically the same as found on my a6000 body. There are a few small detail changes in the interface like omitting the AEL lock button and moving that function to the center button which sadly keeps that button from being used to select ISO. The function display is slightly different. But otherwise the interface should feel instantly familiar to anyone who has used an NEX camera. I quickly set the camera up to my usual settings. One small annoyance is that although the Sony DSCRX100M2 supports bracketed exposures it has reverted to the range that was used in the NEX-3. You can only bracket exposures by a max of 0.7 EV with the Sony DSCRX100M2. not by the full 3EV available in the later NEX and alpha cameras. Sony had introduced a firmware update for the NEX-5n and NEX-7 that implemented the 3EV range for bracketing. I hope they will do the same for the Sony DSCRX100M2. The tilt screen has the same layout as on my prior NEX bodies and is along with the great performance of these cameras one of the big reasons I love working with NEX type cameras.I was most interested in the Sony DSCRX100M2's 28-100mm equivalent F/1.8-4.9 lens. I photographed a favorite test scene with full sun and shadow at each ISO and then imported the RAW files into Lightroom. There I applied the noise and sharpening presets that I had created for importing images from my a6000. Then I went through each image and adjusted the parameters to get the best out of each image to create a new set of import noise/sharpening presets for the Sony DSCRX100M2. Although sharpness was not up to the level of my Sony SEL1670Z Vario-Tessar T E 16-70mm F4 it was nevertheless just as good as the kit lenses supplied on the APS-C NEX/alpha cameras. There was some distortion and slight smearing at the edges and corners at the 28mm equivalent that decreased rapidly by 35mm equivalent and after. Sharpness overall from center to edges was very consistent with no negative attention grabbing fall off. Detail resolution was excellent overall.Noise from the 20.9 MP 1"" Exmor R CMOS sensor was very low one big reason to buy a camera with a larger sensor. ISO 100-400 were as one would expect the best ISO ranges for low noise that required minimal correction. But ISO 800 also produced excellent images after careful correction. ISO 1600 was still very good with correction and ISO 3200 was still able to produce usable images with the right noise and sharpening applied. After 3200 you are pretty much in the image salvage business. The images at ISO 6400 are still head and shoulders above the quality you would get with P&S cameras that use much smaller and much noisier sensors. But detail really starts to suffer there and you also reach the limits of noise reduction that can be applied and redeemed by sharpening and detail adjustments.All in all I was very impressed both by the 28-100mm equivalent F/1.8-4.9 lens the 20.9 MP 1"" Exmor R CMOS sensor the camera's NEX/alpha style interface and the general fit finish and feel of the whole camera. The flash is strong and also has EV adjustments and several modes. For shooters able to take advantage of and work in post production with RAW output this is just a great camera. It is really necessary when working with RAW to use Lightroom or Photoshop for example to make use of Adobe's camera lens geometry adjustment profiles that automatically correct for the sort of distortion that is part of any collapsible P&S type lens no matter how fine the lens may be otherwise.One other note: I bought the Sony DSCRX100M2 instead of one of the later Sony DSCRX100 models because I wanted the 28-100 lens. Although the 24-70mm equivalent lens on later models is from what I have seen superior in some subtle ways to the 28-100 lens I wanted that extra bit of tele extension. After testing the camera and shooting with it I am not disappointed. It's a great lens and a minor miracle considering it's small size and collapsible design that retracts into the camera body. I am a happy user of the Sony DSCRX100M2. RECOMMENDED.",0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B001QWG1ZY,Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W230 12 MP…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Good Camera when you figure out how to set it up !!  October 31  2015By NORMAN FRAZIER,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I was aware of comments regarding slowness of operation and ""fuzzy"" pictures when we bought this camera. I deliberately avoided the 20 MP (or greater) cameras since the processing speed of budget point-and-shoot cameras would be slow to write photo files of this size to memory. Most photo quality printers can only reproduce 8.2 MP in print and the human eye is unable to detect the difference between 8MP and 20 MP. The MP ratings refer to the density and therefore the SIZE of the data file... without a lightning fast processor it's going to take a bit to write a 12 MP photo file to the camera's memory stick... hence the ""slow"" speed and ""fuzzy"" photos... with the ""fuzzy"" part being the result of not holding the camera rock-steady while the processor writes the file to memory.You can compensate for the processor speed by selecting a lower MP setting for your pictures... this will allow you to take and write photo files to memory faster without discernable loss of resolution and quality.... you can find the ""breakpoint"" by taking the same still photo at different MP settings and determining at what setting you notice a degradation in picture quality and write-speedTry it.... it really worked well for me",0

August 27  2016By Bob from Mass.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Nice looking camera but some drawbacks.Primary one is I couldn't use my old SD card from my broken Panasonic and the ""duo"" cards this one uses would cost half as much as the camera for the same GB!I liked the intuitive controls but the icons on the camera dial were so tiny they would be hard to work with. Also the type size in the booklet that comes with it is painfully tiny. (Do they really have something against people with bifocals?) Also disappointing that the booklet doesn't spell out how to transfer photos to your computer. (Tried it by the seat of my paints and it ended up similar to most cameras using their funky cable--which has a release button on the bottom of the plug that goes into the camera. That they should have told us about!) Also was disappointed that I had to take battery out of camera every time I changed it--and one review said that would mean resetting the time and date every time.The two photos I took looked quite nice but not enough to make me want to keep it.",0

October 12  2016By Liz Papenbrock,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is NOT a sturdy camera. The first trip I took it on was overseas and I tripped in fell. It was not a hard fall and the camera was closed and in my purse.  Nevertheless the screen broke and I was unable to take pictures for the rest of my trip.  Giving it 2 stars because the few pictures I got were OK and I liked the pretty blue color of the camera.My other objection is that the memory card Sony uses is proprietary and not a standard card that can be interchanged with other cameras. Will be looking for a different brand next time.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B001QWG1ZY,Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W230 12 MP…,        14 of 14 people found the following review helpful       Absolutely Fabulous!  October 3  2009By The Taminator,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I needed a second still image camera for business since we share a single one in the office which often results in delays. I was so happy with the Sony Cybershot DSCW80 that I bought about two or three years ago that it was a no-brainer to upgrade to this newer higher megapixel version. This is my fourth Sony digital camera and I'm loving it.I can't stress enough how wonderful the anti-blur technology on the camera is. While these newer lightweight cameras are much more portable than their predecessors it's also hard to hold them steady without a little of that extra weight. I don't have Parkinson's but I don't have a steady surgical hand either and this camera totally makes up for it. I don't like using the zoom feature without a tripod but the more you zoom in on any camera the shakier you get if you don't have it on a steady surface. It just goes with the territory.I am an amateur photographer--I use this for just regular photographs of everyday things. I need something simple to point and shoot. It has the same basic controls that my other Sonys have had with the bonus of a slightly larger screen on the back. Most users will probably have little trouble using the dials and menu on the back to try different settings and to view the pictures you've already taken. I doubt if you'll have to consult the manual if you've had any experience with digital cameras before.I have video cameras and image editing software so I didn't use the video function and did not install or use Sony's software on my computer so I can't comment on either of those functions. The battery charges more quickly than previous models and seems to have longer life for my still image shooting. The images are just fantastic--I could wave it around while taking a shot and still get a crisp clean picture.Some people don't like the fact that the lens extends out when you turn it on but I think it's a small price to pay for such quality images. My only other gripe about this camera as with all Sony cameras is the fact that it does not take a standard SD card and you must use Sony's Memory Stick Pro Duo. This isn't necessary it is slightly irritating and if it took a standard SD card I would have given it 5 stars.If you can get past the fact that you'll need to purchase a special memory card for this camera (and it's such a great camera that it's not hard to make that leap) you'll be very happy with this for years to come. I highly recommend this camera for anyone advanced users and beginners alike. It's a fantastic value that will preserve your memories and take great pictures for your business for years to come.,0

I've taken a few thousand photos with it!I also have a Nikon D-500 and a Panasonic Lumix Mega Zoom. Each has it's own unique features / abilities so I also have a good point of reference.You do need to spend some time learning how to take advantage of it's features. The image stabilization can be turned on or off.You need to make sure when you take a picture that you have the dial in the correct position.  If you have hit the Macro button for close ups you won't get a great photo of objects at a distance. On the manual mode you can do a lot of programing but you need to understand how that willaffect your picture. The visual aids on this camera are wonderful. I would suggest you leave them on to help in getting the right settings.I most recently took this camera to Scotland and used it while sailing on a grey day with wind and rain and it took some great photos with no blurring.Don't go cheap on the Memory Stick Duo/PRO Duo which you have to purchase separately and make sure it matches your camera.As I said this camera has performed well for 3 years and I have no complaints and highly recommend it.,0

December 14  2015By SunshineVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I can't quite decide if this is value for money or not. It's very handy and sleek and has a bunch of modes you can play around with. But the picture quality when you zoom in isn't that great. And it's awful at taking pictures in the dark-- or maybe I have yet to figure out how to do that correctly. As far as point and shoot cameras go this one isn't too bad for your general tourist pictures. Not the best bet if you're hung up on capturing distant images or images with great detail. It works for my amateur needs though hence the 4 star rating.,0

I like the camera but am looking for a new one!! I am tired of taking pictures trying to hold my hand perfectly still!! I can move the camera super fast at times and get a great clear picture and other times when I am still and there is little movement from object I get a blurry picture!!!!. My sister in law also stopped using her Same camera due to same annoyance!!! I did not pay the Price it is advertised here !! It was under 200$ It is fun to play with all manipulations on it but you can only do them when they are in the camera not once on the computer.! The zoom is only ok not as much of a zoom as I'd like either. Over all it is ok I do want to get a different one after having this one almost 2 years! I'd keep it if I didn't have to delete soo many blurry pictures and NOT being able to get the quick  photos at that momment. I loose alot of one chance shots!!I bought a digital so I would have something much smaller then my minolta film.  There are pros and cons to a digital in general I guess. I also ready many reveiws before buying this camera and looked at it many times. I do not find many of the problems other do .  You can delete more then one picture at at time just go to grid mode check all ones want gone and poof they gone.  Didn't think anything about lens  zooms out when turned on but I do find my hand in wrong spot at times putting tension on lens. I'm getting used to not having a hand there that is all.  I also too have a hard time getting used to motion pictures. Film one click NO BLUR. Digital get some clear and some blur in same photo but not cameras fault ( Digital thing).  Menu is soso to use but I find that once I get a certain setting I have to search to get it back to prior setting. I have read manual and played with it many times. Just at times you can get one spot from one button but not another. Needs a reset button:) Also you Can see picture after you take one. It has a 2 sec setting.  You ccan take multiple pictures at once. Burst mode works well minimal blur. Overall I enjoy the camera. I have taken it out in cold Screen turns purple after a bit  once warmed up is fine.  Even though you have a big screen no match for a veiw finder. So point and shoot and it usually comes out what I wanted. The few pictures I have printed came out nice. I like to play with it and all the neat effects it has on it:)  Over all I really like the camera  Won't let go of film all together yet. I believe most anyone could use this camera. Especially on easy setting. Just point and shoot. Delay is very lil  until you get into different settings. Battery lasts pretty good. Again never had a digital but I am pleased:) READ directions on how to focus first and then take pictures and you will not have any trouble taking nice pictures.  Only reason I give a 4 is due to it not being as quick as my minolta film!!,1

I also did this with my daughter's baseball team and got a great shot of the kids.Well worth the price fun features great grab and go keep in your pocket or purse camera.,0

We used it for the first time on a kitchen remodel. It's extremely easy to use and setup good quality - not quite 'professional' but definitely use-able. A great starter to introduce yourself to time lapse and see if it's a good fit. The price point is appealing because it have us the opportunity to try it out ourselves without spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars. The battery life is AMAZING especially if you take their recommendation and get Energizer Ultimate Lithium - we left it setup on a jobsite for 3 full months and it still had power and space on the memory SD card. Easy to work with video files it does all the work for you. You don't struggle with hundreds of images it's already in video format. The main trick is getting your settings right - selecting the right time lapse photo intervals - we had a lot of blank space & it will require some editing clipping etc. But it's been a great starter tool for us to bet even more familiar with it & show people and prospects a different side to remodeling - it will be really cool when we have an outdoor/exterior face-lift type job showing ugly to gorgeous in 1-2 minutes! Excited to learn more!I also have to mention - we do some 'flip houses' - we recently had an issue of several break-in's - so we took the Brinno Time Lapse off of the current jobsite we were tracking over the weekend put it up at the flip house that was being broken into - mounting it next door at the neighbors property - and we were able to catch our intruder! The cool part was after the weekend we were able to simply put the camera back up on the original jobsite it was on and pick up right where we left off! Great product!,0

April 27  2014By Ben M. Cowan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The camera works well but make sure you do some testing before you miss an irreplaceable moment (or many of them).Here's a big tip.  When you prepare to gather your camera to process the videos make sure you press and hold the enter button until the screen says processing.  If you just press it quickly it starts recording a new video RIGHT OVER THE ONE YOU ACTUALLY WANT!!  Then you just have a time lapse video of your feet.You'll also need to test how often it takes a picture and the frame rate to make sure it turns out correctly.  Don't spend days filming something only to find out it isn't what you were expecting.Finally if you are recording a long term time lapse and not including nightitme hours you'll need to download some free video editing software such as Windows Movie Maker to stitch them back together because it creates a new video for each day of recording.Overall I have enjoyed using this camera.  I have used it mainly for demolition and construction projects.  It can be fascinating to watch over and over.  I also like to watch quicker ones for cloud activity etc.  For a time lapse camera that doesn't require a continuous power source you'll have a hard time finding a better one.,0

Very easy to use we highly recommend this.Each week I download the daily videos and a compile them into a single video. I especially like the fact that you can set a start / stop time per day and that you can adjust the time interval between images. I didn't want to waste a lot of shots on night shots when there is nothing to record. I now have the camera set to take one shot every 15 minutes from 7:30 am to 6:00 pm.Once the house project is complete I plan to re-use the camera as a security camera. Double duty!,0

With four Energizer lithium AA batteries and a 32 G SD card the camera will run for a year on the 5 minute (no night pics) setting.  Amazing.  The setup is mostly intuitive but a few minutes with the manual is helpful.  Bottom line is that this is a terrific value and the next step up in complexity and quality is a quantum leap.  There are lots of options if you only need a system to work for a few hours but when you're interested in documenting days weeks and months it gets bulky and messy.  It's a very wide angle view and understand the resolution is low so you will generally not be able to identify people you don't know; if you need a high resolution image this isn't your choice.I have these set up monitoring the exterior of a remote cabin.If you're mounting outside using the clear housing and expect rain I recommend polishing the lens area with Rain-X or something similar. You may not be comfortable with the included mounting options.  I mounted a couple of $6 camera swivels on a cheap angle brace.,0

The photos are turned into video files that eventually have to be pieced together to make one long video to see the whole project.  Microsoft movie maker works just fine for this and allows you to save in different formats.  The container also has a few entry points where we found dust and moisture can penetrate but have never messed up the pictures.  I would have given 5 stars had it come with software a truly waterproof container and better instructions.  As is those are my only complaints.  The quality of video is excellent and the batteries have lasted quite a long time since we only take video for 5 sec per day.  It is an excellent alternative to the more expensive cameras that require hard-wiring and emit their own cellular signal.,0

After one day I watched the video and its incredible.  Such a great idea! I have been putting the time lapse videos on our website and facebook and its getting a lot of attention. The camera is really easy and puts the images into a video for you so you really just film then take the memory card out and put it into your computer.  Boom you're done. Just a heads up that I would purchase a 32G or 64G memory card for it because the memory card it comes with gets filled up quickly.,0

This Brinno lasted 7 months in the snow rain and summer heat. There were no issues with leaks. Although we don't think it needed one we changed the battery once (just in case) during this entire time span. We had this set at 15 minute intervals during the daytime. The only issue we had was maintaining the foliage that was growing around the pole we installed this camera on. Though it was entertaining to see the leaves growing over the camera view. Highly recommended for any time-lapse projects.,1

October 20  2016By Ric P.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have shot thousands of photos w/ the Coolpix P600 over the years. I got this camera for the RAW feature and the added Megapixels.This is the same P600 body but in a Matte Finish and so a bit grippier.Uses the same battery EN-EL23 and the same cards so I was good to go.After setting to RAW + F (fine) Image Size to 20 M and turning off the digital zoom I took it for a test spin.I'll be using this primarily for birding so I started there.First impressions are Viewfinder is FAR better than the P600 Zoom is smoother and Auto Focus (you probably will not want to us Manual Focus as it's a pain) is faster VR (image stabilization) is KILLER!Single point Focus is dead on as you can see from the shot of a Sparrow buried in the rose bush.Full Zoom (not digital) is dead on crisp. The Cardinal was shot on a windy cloudy dark day in AP Mode (lighter Cardinal shots) and Bird Mode at about 50'. Hand held and braced. Cardinals at full optical zoom.So far I am VERY Impressed!If you are a Birder and Nature shooter you will LOVE this Camera!P600/610 on steroids.Haven't used the Wi-Fi Snap Feature or Video yet so I can't speak to that.,1

So far I'm extremely impressed. I bought this camera (to replace my Canon powershot sx50 hs) with 2 criteria in mind: Ergonomics and raw/high res. pics. The ergonomics work perfect for me. I can hold the camera with one hand when using the viewfinder without inadvertently activating various functions which invariably happened with the Canon.Shooting raw produces 30 MB files and when converted are about 10 MB jpg with the Nikon  progs or 15-18 MB with Photoshop. The detail and clarity is amazing!Couple of other points which might be useful for some: The lens thread is 52 mm for mounting filters/hood and pinpoint focus can be found in the scene/bird-watching mode,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01C3LE44G,Nikon COOLPIX B700 Digital Camera,        16 of 17 people found the following review helpful       Zoomed in and snap on target (mostly)  November 10  2016By Paul McGowan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"First let me say that the B700 has some really nice glass. The zoom is incredible. However the Nikon menus leave much to be desired. They are a bit confusing with a lot of modes and settings being buried in odd locations. Part of my frustration has to do with the fact I'm coming off the Nikon D5100 where most camera modes/functions are a LOT more ""convenient"" and intuitive. Another frustration and one that Nikon should be ashamed of is the viewfinder. It desperately needs a rubber eye-cup. The viewfinder currently sits behind a flat HARD piece of plastic and there is a cheesy square cut out to look through (COME ON NIKON!!!). If it's bright outside the sun is gonna blind you because you can't seal it out on the flat plastic plus it's just plain uncomfortable.....a bit of thought regarding comfort and usability would have been nice. Nevertheless this camera is lighter than any of the pro body cameras and that is what I wanted. It's easy to grip and use the zoom. The flash is adequate in close pictures but a hot-shoe would have been great........or even a Bluetooth function to control an external flash. A cheap software fix that was ignored. Of course many of the speed-lights today will trigger off the camera flash or can be controlled manually............but that's a pain. One other thing that is missing is a lens hood..........Nikon............you know it needs it! Now I have to go by a cheesy rubber one.Let's talk focus! There are several focus modes and most are spot on especially the single point focus. Nevertheless personally I would have preferred the ""manual focus"" to be usable in all modes.....not an option but you can use it in M mode.. You can assign some functions (such as manual focus) to buttons on the camera which is helpful. I made the zoom on the lens act as manual focus. Which works perfectly......in M mode.The zoom truly is extraordinary! The pictures below (pic 1 - horses are in the distance over the hill) were taken at dusk and the subjects were almost 3/4 of a mile away. I did not have a tripod and due to the low light (and my shaky hands) there was a small amount of digital noise. As you can see the camera can take acceptable pics at great distances. I did not use RAW mode in this instance but if you have a EXTREME PRO memory card (at least a Class 10 SDXC UHS-I Memory Card or you're gonna have some REAL problems with this camera in video and RAW modes) then I HIGHLY recommend using the RAW + F mode. Yes the files are large but the quality is astounding and batch editing is a dream! If you can't afford Adobe products then check out Coral PaintShop Pro and AfterShot Pro.........for less than $50 bucks each you can do almost anything Adobe Lightroom can do with RAW or JPEG files.As a disabled amateur photographer I have enjoyed being free from  carrying 25lbs of lenses speedlights filters batteries and converters with me but If your looking for studio quality pics out of the box with this camera then you might be better off with something else.  Every camera takes time to get the feel of so I expect my pics (and the frustration with the wonky menus) to get better. For the money you can't beat this camera!",1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01C3LE44G,Nikon COOLPIX B700 Digital Camera,        76 of 87 people found the following review helpful       I SSSOOOOOO wanted to love this camera! But I'm disappointed... :(  October 21  2016By 7,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Boy oh boy have I been waiting for this camera! As a previous owner and lover of the Nikon Coolpix P610 and a current owner of a Canon SX60 HS I was dying for Nikon to remedy the main flaw of the P610 by adding RAW file capture to its successor. That's really what the P610 was missing and almost the only reason I sold my P610 and got an SX60 HS instead. So the day Nikon announced the B700 my order went in at Amazon and I got to wait around for about half a year... :(I must put my review into perspective so people know exactly where I'm coming from. I have a lot of cameras that do all kinds of things. PNS (Point-And-Shoot) to waterproof all kinds of DSLRs pro bodies and glass etc. I am NOT buying this camera to do a little bit of everything nor did I get it as a travel camera. I got this camera as many others have/will solely to shoot wildlife/nature at full telephoto wide open aperture preferably at base ISO of 100 with VR on in full sunlight shooting in RAW with the intent of post-processing later. Sure I'll shoot other things with it and not all my shots will be at the above settings. But that is why I bought it and that's the primary aim of this review. I’ll start with a Novice Review followed by Pros & Cons assuming Advanced photographic knowledge then Summary then descriptions of my sample photos.NOVICE REVIEW:The main reason to consider this camera is because of its mega-telephoto lens! It certainly has a lot of reach! Unfortunately I’m going to have to be a bit of a buzzkill here. At/near full telephoto the VR (Vibration Reduction) simply is not good enough to truly eliminate camera shake. Make no mistake this is a superb lens capable of razor sharp photos even at full tele. But in real life pointing and shooting (automatic modes) at full tele is going to yield somewhat sharp to straight-up blurry results. Ironically this PNS camera requires advanced technique to actually harness the capability that is its main selling point; mega-telephoto.From full wideangle (24mm equiv.) to around 500mm-ish equiv. it will routinely capture super-sharp beautiful colorful images. JPEG compression (even JPEG FINE) is quite aggressive so pixel-peeping at 100% will be less than spectacular. But for making prints 18”x24” JPEG Fine should easily work well enough.If 4K video is a main reason you’re getting this camera think carefully about that decision. The B700’s 4K video like its JPEGs is overly compressed and sound is very hissy. So watching on a Samsung SUHD TV wasn’t very inspiring. Quality 1080p video upscaled to a 4K TV will easily look better.There is a plethora of special modes. Star Trails should be a fun one and Selective Color is something I’ve always enjoyed playing around with. HDR is now buried in a Menu called “Backlighting.” Once you find and enable HDR it works pretty well.This camera commands such a price because of its really really long lens and its ability to capture images in RAW format. If you don’t intend to shoot RAW (only good for post-processing in Lightroom or similar) then this camera’s predecessor (Nikon P610) is much better as it is very nearly identical has built-in GPS and far superior VR and costs less. And if you’re buying this camera for the mega-telephoto don’t. The VR just is not good enough to freeze at full tele. If you NEED this much telephoto AND RAW consider the Canon SX60 HS. Or consider waiting until Canon releases the SX60 HS’ successor or until Nikon releases the P900’s successor. Otherwise consider a much less expensive and smaller(!) camera with fewer megapixels. 20MP is too many for such a tiny sensor and low-light/high-ISO performance suffers too much because of those unnecessary extra Megapixels.PROS:1) This lens really does have truly exceptional glass in it. Given proper disciplined technique razor sharp (in the center) results are obtainable all the way through the zoom range.2) Bokeh is very pleasing. A very nice bonus at this price point.3) RAW files! I was pleasantly shocked to see that a 3-stop push from ISO 100 is virtually indistinguishable from proper exposure at ISO 800! Pushed 100 is just as grainy and noisy as properly-exposed 800 but not more and color doesn’t shift at all. Very respectable usable latitude here.4) Continuous High frame advance seems REALLY fast! Seems much faster than the claimed 5fps.5) Having the EVF (Electronic Viewfinder) automatically turn on and off when something approaches the EVF is very convenient. Though the EVF sensor is too sensitive and activates at around 3 inches. ½ inch to 1 inch would be ideal.6) The grip is very well-shaped and textured. It’s as secure a grip as I’ve come across and DSLRs could learn from it.7) Very small and lightweight considering the extreme zoom range!8) The articulating screen will come in handy every now and then.9) Snapbridge makes instant GPS data transfer from phone to camera as simple as turning your phone’s GPS on. Far better than Nikon’s old Wireless Mobile Utility but still not nearly as good as built-in GPS.10) Though tiny the EN-EL23 battery has good capacity. I shot over 200 pictures about 2/3 RAW-only and about 1/3 RAW+JPEG Norm with about 30 flash pops and and a fair amount of photo reviewing and the battery still indicated full. Of course it wasn’t truly full but even with true 1/3 remaining capacity that’s solid. If you need more battery capacity than that carrying a spare battery barely takes any space in your pocket or bag.CONS:1) VR is simply inadequate for full tele. Even with VR on full tele is going to require shutter speeds of about 1/1000 to achieve feather fur or eye detail. Even on stationary subjects. Or flash will need to be used to eliminate blur. Unfortunately flash is too weak to illuminate beyond about 6 feet or so at full tele at ISO 100 and that is just about minimum focus distance. VR will get you quite sharp results down to about 1/125 but prevents perfection. Turning VR off and tripod-mounting is the way to let this lens impress you at full tele but that’s not practical for birds or any wildlife.2) ISO performance is poor at/above ISO 400 depending on your tolerance. Lightroom +10 Color Noise Reduction takes care of the color noise but luminance noise can take a good deal more work.3) While potentially extremely sharp and bright in the center the edges and corners in particular are quite soft and the light falloff is noticeable.4) RAW file size is unnecessarily large. Each and every B700 .NRW file will be 32283KB (32MB). Seems like uncompressed RAW. Even my 24MP D610's .NEF files are generally only around 25MB and they have more processing latitude.5) 1/4000 shutter speed is not available at longer focal lengths. At full tele wide open at F6.5 the fastest shutter speed is 1/2000.6) OMG no dynamic Auto Minimum Shutter Speed for Auto ISO that factors focal length??? Even worse is that the Minimum Shutter Speed you manually enter cannot be faster than 1/125! This means that Aperture Priority mode is unusable at full tele unless you’re well-braced and shooting stationary subjects with bright sunlight or flash at 6'.7) Reviewing photos is unbelievably inconvenient as zooming the image across the full screen is not possible from the one Display that shows EXIF data. So after viewing the EXIF data you must press Display twice in order to get to the right Display to properly zoom the review image. Then 2 more presses of Display to get back to EXIF. And there is about a second of lag each time you press Display. Repeat this process for every image you wish to review. Infuriating…8) The menu system is maddening! There is no Custom Menu nor is there a Quick Menu like Canon has for its Powershot cameras. When Nikon falls behind Canon in menus there’s a huge problem…9) Changing Shooting Modes results in a graphic that takes up 1/3 of the screen and stays on for about 4 seconds and there is nothing that can be done about that.10) Focus points positioned on smaller distant objects tend to focus not on what they should. I use AF Area Mode “Manual Spot.” I put that spot on a face about 60 feet away at 500mm equiv. and it will focus on the background. Doesn’t matter where the spot is in the frame it will miss very regularly.11) No AF-C (Continuous Focus). I cannot tell the difference between and AF-F and PRE-AF. They do the same thing as far as I’m concerned. But regardless of whether you choose AF-S AF-F or PRE-AF focusing will lock and stop when the release button is pressed halfway. Therefore you will always have to either stab the release button (if you weren’t touching it) or release and then stab (if you were holding it halfway) when you wish to shoot. Then the camera will re-focus and then shoot. This is at best a ¼ second lag and that is an eternity at 1440mm equiv. shooting wildlife. The workaround is to shoot in Continuous High release mode and routinely fire 5 shots in a “spray and pray” method. That’s about 161MB per burst and there will be tons of wasted shots and still very many missed shots.12) Phantom aperture closures. I don’t know how this happens but I often find that I’m shooting at F7.2 or some other F-Stop that is closed down often by more than a full Stop from wide open. I almost exclusively shoot in Aperture Priority and make it a point to stay wide open with this camera but somehow aperture keeps on stopping down. It is not like me ever to accidentally turn a dial. I suppose it’s possible that’s what’s happening here but it doesn’t seem very likely at all. With ISO needing to be as low as possible this is a big problem.13) No real filter threads. A 52mm filter can be mounted but the threads are barely biting and the filter is easily knocked off.14) JPEG compression is too high. But you should be getting this camera strictly for RAW (otherwise get the P610 for JPEG) so…15) On the first day I used the B700 I was trying to shoot something in Macro and the lens hunted back and forth and finally made a bad plasticky grinding sound (gears?) for a few seconds and then stopped. I power cycled and to date that has not happened again.16) No built-in GPS.17) No battery charger??? OMG! Charging via Micro USB plugged into the B700 (like you would a phone) and it is a painfully slow charging process. Nikon wants $45 for the MH-67P battery charger but you can get an aftermarket generic one for around $10 and you’ll need one.18) No hot shoe to use a real flash. The Canon SX60 HS has a hot shoe...SUMMARY:Breaks my heart to say but I like using my Canon SX60 HS far more due to the vastly superior menus/accessibility and image review process. The SX60 HS also has better low-light performance/shadow detail and is about the same in terms of real life full tele RAW performance. If tripod-mounted with Stabilization off the B700’s lens blows away the SX60 HS’ but nobody will ever shoot either of these cameras in this fashion. I have many gripes with the SX60 HS. Unfortunately even more with the B700. If the B700’s VR was as good as the P610’s I would be willing to tolerate the many shortcomings of the B700 which in all fairness are carryovers from the P610. Alas this 6ish-month delay for the B700 wasn’t worth it to me and I’ll be returning mine to Amazon for a refund. I’m waiting for the Nikon P900’s and Canon SX60 HS’ successors. :(SAMPLE PHOTOS:Photo 1 & 2) Okay so below you'll see a full-face photo of my kitten and the eye photo is a tight crop taken from the same photo. It was shot handheld with VR on indoors about 10-feet (3m) from the subject in RAW (.NRW) full telephoto 258mm (1440mm equiv.) ISO 100 wide open at F6.5 1/500 flash on with -1/3 stop exposure compensation pre-dialed-in. The full-face photo is only slightly cropped as it was not quite centered. Both photos were downsized to 1440x1080 pixels for upload to Amazon. In Lightroom 6 my workflow was: Exposure +1.00 (It was totally underexposed to start with) Contrast +25 Highlights -20 Whites +10 Vibrance +20 Saturation +10 Orange Saturation +5 Green Saturation +30. Sharpening stayed at default value of 25 no image straightening lens correction vignette correction noise reduction or chromatic aberration correction. I did a little extra work specifically to the eyes.Photo 3 & 4) Kahlua bottle was shot at full telephoto at 1/5 second ISO 100 tripod mounted with VR off and converted from RAW to 1440x1080 JPEG with no editing whatsoever and then a tight crop from the center of the frame. I think focus was slightly off and that's why it's not sharper. Still pretty good.Photo 5 6 & 7) Contrary to my ""wildlife in sunlight"" style the bedding photo is a test of Macro and high ISO. This was RAW zoomed full wide at minimum focus in Macro Mode at ISO 3200 1/200 wide open at F3.3. There have been no lens corrections or noise reduction actions. The inside of my 52mm filter can be seen sharply vignetting the corners. As the close-ups show there is a fair amount of color noise in the brighter areas and a lot of color noise in the shadows. +10 Color Noise Reduction in Lightroom removes all color noise (I haven't provided that sample).Photo 8) This ""daisy"" was shot through a window screen hence the echoed image and soft dreaminess. It is very cropped down and represents only about 1/3 of the full frame. RAW full tele handheld with VR on ISO 100 1/1000 F6.5 edited in Lightroom.Photos 9 & 10) Lazy cat... ISO 800 straight RAW conversion to JPEG; no editing at all. Highlights are clipping. The eye close-up is a straight crop from this frame.Photo 11) This lens suffers from flare and ghosting a little too often.Photos 12 & 13) Full frame of a tiare (Tahitian gardenia) and stamen/pollen close-up cropped from it. RAW ISO 100 handheld VR on F6.5 1/2000 full tele 1440mm equiv. This is about as sharp as this lens can get at full tele with wide open aperture handheld with VR on and no flash. As the tight crop shows individual pollen grains are discernible though not super-well defined. Still as I'm even critiquing it the way I would professional gear is great praise for this lens indeed! It's just that it takes too much work to coax the best out of this lens at/near full tele and suitable real-life subjects will be rare and it will be luck that is the real reason for razor sharp shots at full tele.Photos 14 & 15) The green box with books behind it was shot at F5.3 1/8 second in both photos and they are both tight crops representing about 10% of the full original size. The first shot was at ISO 100 and was 3 stops underexposed and then 3 stops were added back in Lightroom. The second shot was properly exposed at ISO 800 with no editing at all.",1
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01C3LE44G,Nikon COOLPIX B700 Digital Camera,        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       first experiments with my new camera.  January 8  2017By Goat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera is versatile and reasonably easy to handle. It took me a while to get it adjusted for taking movies into the light as automatic features may underexpose the shadows and sometimes focus on the vegetation behind the backlit subject/animal. The minimum focus distance varies as you move to higher zoom magnification and occasionally caused a shot to be missed or discarded as a small bird moved close to me. This may be overcome with the continuous focus setting (which doesn't always stay with the subject). These are not problems with this camera but rather with using superzooms in general on smaller wildlife. After a month in Africa I should have a better idea how well the stabilizing system works out the window of a hot running vehicle! I have no doubt that all fixed (non-video) shots will be fine.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01C3LE44G,Nikon COOLPIX B700 Digital Camera, Great little camera  February 20  2017By Deborah A RitchVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great little walk around camera which is what I bought it for. Got tired of lugging all my gear just so I would have a camera in the car for those times when I would say ""I wish I had my camera"". I normally shoot with a Nikon D7200. Obviously the quality of the B700 is not the same but for the money and convenience it's a nice camera.I especially like the fact that it shoots in RAW format. Great for first time photographers as you can shoot in manual ( which is the best way to learn in my opinion) or just put it on Auto. There's also shutter and aperture priority. Or good for people like myself who just want something to always have with me without having to spend a fortune. I added a couple sample photos to show the quality. Both were shot in manual mode but I'm sure you can get just as good shots shooting in Auto Priority etc.",1

October 29  2016By Alex Varela Larios,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just received mine and it's great. I love it. I wanted to have a backup camera for a short trip to Europe the next month. So I will retire my Nikon P610 which I will use as a backup and will start using this one. The photo quality is outstanding I'm including a couple of pics using Macro function. In addition to that its zoom capacities are amazing no complaints about it I'm attaching three pics that prove it. I do need to do more video recording tests the UHD 4K feature is brilliant! but the 7 minutes restriction is ridiculous makes no sense at all. About SnapBridge it works perfectly with my S7 Edge. It downloads pics automatically no issues to report on this matter. As a summary it is highly recommendable affordable compact-size and great quality all at the same time.,1

Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B01C3LE44G,Nikon COOLPIX B700 Digital Camera, Great Camera  February 10  2017By AtsobeVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This camera in every sense delivers what is expected.  The camera is light weight with easy setup and start up.  The zoom is truly remarkable and allows clear image.  The smartbridge access allows pictures to transfer to your mobile device with minimal interaction.  The Smartbridge application is free and requires an email and personal data to setup.  The Wifi and Bluetooth functions work well to connect your camera with mobile devices. I love to take pictures and own several cameras from the very professional to using cell phone.  Overall I would recommend the purchase of this camera.,1

April 27  2016By dennis B,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,We got a lemon.  We bought the camera the end of January and it stopped powering on at the end of March.  We contacted Sony and were told to send to a repair place 900 miles away - at our expense (over $12.00!).  We received it back.  It worked for 1 picture and then had the exact same problem.  I contacted Sony again.  They wanted me to send it back to the same place that couldn't fix it to begin with!  They kept referring me to another rep who would then call back and repeat the same line - send it back to the repair place.  I wanted a new camera this place obviously didn't know what they were doing and it should not have gone bad after 2 months of limited use.  I finally resorted to facebook and was told they would call this afternoon.  They did - and gave the same response!  What did they not understand??  I have talked to over a half dozen people about this and never got any satisfaction.  You would think they would just replace the camera and be done with it.  Thankfully Amazon has offered to accept this return.  We will not replace it with a Sony (which has increased $20 since we bought it in January) because the true test of a company is not in the sale but in handling problems.  Sony failed big time in that department. It's unfortunate because it was decent camera the few times it worked...,0

Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this camera to replace my previous Sony camera of the same lineage after the previous camera was dropped on its open lens and would no longer close its lens.I did not buy this camera to use in place of a higher end DSLR and I do not expect to use it in this manner.  I know the camera has limitations but I also use it for what I believe it is for: A pocket point and shoot camera with higher quality pictures for travel and as a daily casual camera.For this purpose I believe this camera takes great pictures.  I am still working out some of the features of the camera to adjust pictures taken at night but I am really happy with the picture quality so far.  It has a deeper zoom than my previous camera so I can actually take closer pictures than my previous Sony camera.I also have no issues regarding the Sony software as I typically take my SD card out and stick it in a card reader.  I did test out the wired cable and while it did install drivers I actually just accessed my pictures as if it were a USB drive.The camera itself is a little on the gentle side but I generally keep my camera in a padded leather travel case when not in use as I have owned higher end cameras and I am well aware of fragility of all cameras and the hardware inside.Updates from the previous model: Most of the features have been combined into the selection dial which is also a button.  The screen is a little bigger.  It has a wider zoom.  Some of the digital enhancement features offer better stabilization.Regarding some of the issues with night pictures - it seems the camera takes better pictures and uses its own digital aperture sensor to balance the surrounding light in the area to take a better picture.  While I haven't had a chance to really play with night pictures I was able to take some decent pictures of buildings with neon signs and I only had issues with two of my night time pictures.I have uploaded some pictures with this review - the day light pictures were taken through a window.  The evening pictures were taken after 10:00 pm and the lighting involved is neon sulfur street lights and other business lighting. Please note I took the pictures to exclusively test the camera out of the box.Alright having had some more time to fiddle with the camera they have completely updated the digital apertures into a user friendly picture menu located under the ""SCN"" menu and a few more night shot options are otherwise in the rest of the aperture menu.  I was actually able to take some pretty nice night and low light shots though this camera is intended to be a simple point-n-shoot.  I did not need an additional manual and the aperture menu was easy to navigate just push the button in the dial and move the dial up or down to find what one needs to use.",1

I primarily use it for capturing memories at family events and other parties.  The purpose is to capture events in better quality than a smartphone but still be very portable and versatile.  Especially indoors the low-light photos from point and shoot is far superior to the smartphone.The main reason I chose this specific point and shoot was for the software and micro-HDMI output directly to the Television for quick and easy slideshows.,0

I was looking for a reasonably-priced compact camera that was packed with features and had WI-FI capabilities so I could easily send images to my phone. After trying and rejecting models from Nikon and Panasonic I much prefer the Sony Cyber Shot. The Nikon and Panasonic models - at a higher price - either didn't connect with my phone (I have an iPhone 6) or doing so and sending the images was far too complicated. Once I had the Sony app on my phone connectivity was quick and I found it very easy to send images from the camera to my phone then I'm all set to upload to Facebook text message etc.,0

I had the predecessor camera to this one from Sony (DSC-W180). It would fit in my pocket when mountain climbing.  It served me well on my hiking adventures taking videos and stills.It took great pictures and videos and was very rugged.When it hit a rock too many times and the case broke I had to replace it so I ordered this camera figuring a newer Sony would perform better.  Was I wrong.This camera is terrible.First the processing time after you take a picture is very long.  More than a two seconds.  There is no way a camera in 2016 should take so long to process a still picture. It is very annoying.Second. the battery life is very short.  Probably half the battery life of my older camera.Third the flash is terrible.  Again it performs worse than the first generation of digital cameras. It producing strong ""Flash in the face"" look where peoples faces are over exposed.  This is cause by poor feedback circuits in the flash control system.  I played with all the flash settings and it never worked well.Finally in low light the camera is just OK (without a flash).  I would have hoped for better with the backside illuminated sensor.I think the designers of this camera tried to jam more pixels into the camera for this model and took a hit on all the other parameters of the camera.I am planning to throw away the camera and get a different one.",0

Nice HD video.  May 10  2016By Steve Bennett,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm a bit of a novice so some of you may know how to correct these things. Since the camera is so small the flash isn't the best. I was worried about the camera being hard to hold with it being so small but it's been fine.  Then again I do use the camera strap. I got some spotlighting effects when I take pictures with the flash.  If I don't use the flash especially inside the color is better but people need to be absolutely still or they get blurred.  I do like the HD video quite a bit but I don't have any HD video to compare it to. It's the first time I've been able to record at that level. I've used Picasa to try to download pictures from the camera and that works ok though Sony seems to suggest their own software. Charging the battery isn't the easiest but is ok. The price was cheaper than some of the other cameras I was considering. I think overall I had better luck with my old panasonic and will likely look that way next time if it has HD video.,0
Point & Shoot Digital Cameras,B00M9AB81O,Sony DSCWX220/B 18.2 MP Digital Camera…,        9 of 10 people found the following review helpful       Not recommended for close-up pictures.  March 22  2016By Bobaganoosh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This camera was pretty disappointing for our use. I bought this to use at my work after comparing its reviews to similarly priced cameras online. We just wanted something simple that took decent pictures of test setups and products. This camera actually takes pretty good pictures of distant things or places probably people too but I've never tried. It may work better for different applications but if you want to take close-up images of things please continue to read this review.There are several issues with the picture quality:1. Every picture is noisy. There's just noise everywhere. You cannot zoom in on anything once you put the image on the computer screen because anything that looked even mildly in focus is not and becomes noisy immediately. Using the camera's zoom on anything closer than 10 feet away causes it to not be able to focus which brings me to the next issue.2. This picture is terrible at taking close-up images. I have to take pictures of PCBs sometimes or metal housing to identify any issues and this just does not like to take close up pictures. It will not focus on anything and the menus are no help.3. The menu options and navigation are terrible. For example there is superior auto intelligent auto and program auto for mode selection. I hope you like auto. Not sure which auto is the best auto they almost automatically do the automatic same thing automatically. I honestly can't imagine a design meeting where someone said ""we're going to have program auto where they can adjust a few options but then we'll have intelligent auto and superior auto two modes that are so close and ambiguous in naming convention that the user will never know which one is the best choice at any particular time.""4. The port cover over the micro-USB port broke after about 5 uses. It has the smallest plastic tabs imaginable that are supposed to clip in and hold it ""closed"". Well they broke off so the whole port cover just sticks out a half inch from the camera and is a minor annoyance unless you want to literally break the whole thing off.I have attached a photo example of trying to take a close up picture. Sadly that is about as clear of a close-up as this is capable of. Notice the noise around everything that is not dead-center in the image then zoom in and see that it's there too and nothing is actually clear. For an 18.2MP camera I expected to be able to zoom in on a picture and not have it instantly look like I'm wearing someone else's prescription glasses.",1

June 20  2016By Brandy86,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is a fantastic little camera! I've owned several point-and-shoot cameras over the years including Canon Nikon and Kodak brands and this one is the best so far.  I've owned this camera for 3 weeks now and have taken it on one vacation and many excursions.  It's ready to go straight out of the box (battery comes pre-charged) and is very easy to use.  I could easily navigate the controls based on past camera experience.  I have yet to need the manual for anything but at some point I will have to use it to figure out the transfer to smartphone feature because it is not intuitive.  The buttons are very small which is good for people with small hands but if you have larger fingers or hands they may not be easy to navigate.  I took approximately 200 pictures on the first day and still had 1 bar left on the battery meter.  It was fully charged again in an hour and a half.  The tiny size of the camera is one of it's best features.  It fits easily into the pockets of my ""skinny jeans"" (you know the ones with the tiny half-pockets in the front).  And the Sony DSCWX220 weighs just a few ounces so you may even forget it's in your pocket.  The pictures are sharp and have vibrant colors.  The auto-focus works quite well and you are able to get the small details in each shot.  The shutter speed is incredibly quick compared to other cameras and smartphones so you don't miss capturing those once in a lifetime moments.  The quality of the pictures taken are much better than my Samsung S5 or my husbands Samsung 6.  It takes very good pictures in low light.  I'm not saying these are high-end professional quality pictures but it's a huge step up from smartphone quality.  For well under $200 it's a steal for budget conscious casual shooters.",0

I know what you may be thinking...one per year? they must be junk!Not really. I take 100 photo's per day in some of the worst places...attics and crawlspaces...it gets dropped in dirt onto wood porches off roofs and even in my pocket that gets dirt into it. ...so it takes a real beating over a period of a year....they continue to work but the buttons start falling off and it becomes unusable.It takes great pictures for the price and wifi download is so simple...takes about 5 minutes to transfer 100 photo's.Downside is that the cost of this little unit is getting out of hand. I first started buying them at $120 now they are close to $200.00.Finding the right model is tough...there are just too many cameras with the cybershot name and trying to distinguish b/t each model is difficult.....looked for awhile to find the model that still has wifi that was affordable. Affordable being...a camera under $200 that will only last me a year.,0

I have always used Canons and was actually looking to buy a Canon when I started playing around with the display Sony DSC-WX220 while waiting for the sales associate to return... I was instantly impressed!! I was just pointing and clicking not trying to hold steady and get a clear image just sort of goofing around.... But every image came out crisp and clear it was amazing!I decided to go ahead and buy this little camera (along with a Canon SX710 which is absolutely incredible!!). It has really fun features like ""Gourmet food"" mode and ""pet"" mode haha they are a little silly but seem to work! You can also select one color to stand out like red or green and everything else will be black and white... this was particularly cool when photographing my bright green lorikeet :)!Overall this camera has noticeably better image quality than many of the other digital cameras I have tried and owned. You can even edit pictures right then and there adjust brightness and contrast smooth out skin etc it's nuts!I would definitely go for it with this camera and make sure you get the gold because it's really nice and pristine looking :).",1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        874 of 906 people found the following review helpful       G4 Play is a very easy to use phone! Detailed review with pictures.  November 1  2016By Daisy S,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,First of all I am picky about phones tablets...all electronics. Being a techie type I researched many phones before I decided to purchase this G4 Play...And after using this phone every day all day long I have discovered that this was the best choice of a phone for me.Well I have written my review as if I were you reading reviews trying to decide to buy this phone or not...PROS:+ MICRO SIM CARD -- While Nano Sims are gradually being the standard SIM size and are the size for newer phones I still like this size.Note to Nano SIM users: You can install a Nano SIM in this phone IF you carefully place it into an adapter or just go to your phone store and they can move your info from your Nano Card to a new Micro SIM card. Be sure you have a new Micro SIM with you in case they do not have one. Amazon sells Micro Sims.+ Size Weight and Comfort of the Phone...This 5 inch screen weight of the phone comfort while holding this phone are some major reasons why I bought this phone. I had a huge 5.5 Samsung J7 (2015). It was too big for my small hands and very uncomfortable to hold. And because the G4 Play is a lighter weight phone and not bulky I am love this!This phone fits my hand perfectly and comfortable to hold.+ Memory/Storage has 16GB Internal however after OS and factory apps 10.6 GB left. External card slot can handle up to 256GB.There is no bloatware...pure Android experience...About twenty one essential factory Installed apps including Phone and Help. Most of the apps are Android / Google Apps. Only about six Motorola apps which includes the Camera File Manager FM Radio Phone Settings and Calc.  Motorola allows Android and Google to supply just the Apps you need however later on you can install Apps you like as there is plenty of room left.  Below is a list of Google / Android Apps pre-installed on this phone:* Calendar (Google Calendar)* Clock (Google Clock)* Contacts (Google)* Chrome Internet Browser* FM Radio App (Moto installed this on this phone no Internet needed...real FM Radio)* Google App* Google Maps* Google Music* Hangouts (Google)* Messenger (Google Messenger for Texts and MMS (Picture or Video Messages).* Photos (It is a Photo Gallery by Google).* Play Movies/Play Music* Playstore* Settings (Android Settings)Because I just installed Apps I wanted like Facebook Twitter PrinterShare and other large Apps I still have 8.25 GB Internal Storage now left if I want to add more apps later on.+ Memory & Storage Size & Speed ... The Internal Memory and RAM are adequate and I find the phone runs plenty fast and for me no lagging never freezes. A very peppy phone in my opinion.+ Marshmallows 6.01 installed  and promises to  later update to Nougat 7 OS when available.  This I am very happy about because my Samsung J7 M model has yet to update to Marshmallow it still has Lollipop. Other J7 models should get it but I am not sure J7 M model my old one ever will.+ Camera...It is just 8MP however I took inside and outside pictures and they came out very clear in my opinion. This is much to my happy surprise.+ Screen Resolution/Special Screen Information - For me personally I find the resolution (at 294 PPI - Pixels Per Inch) excellent as the colors in the screen are very bright and vivid and very clear! In fact webpages and my Kindle Reading app are just stunning on this phone! *All of my pictures and videos are crystal clear with this phone.***OUTSIDE VIEWING in Direct Sunlight with this screen...  OK if I turn the screen slightly to the right because the Brightness NITS are about 400 Nits so this is good (adequate). Some more expensive phones have at least 500 Nits...some have close to 700 Nits of brightness. The higher the Brightness Nits the easier it is to see your screen in bright sunlight. * There is no way to increase the Nits on this phone but I could view it somewhat in direct sunlight.+ WiFi and 4G (LTE) (Internet)Info:WiFi Connects to any WiFi and the signal strength is excellent (even in the very back of my home and outside) most of the time I have 4 bars (outside is 3 bars).LTE (Data) When not near a router or WiFi hotspot then I use LTE (Data) for Internet. The LTE on  this phone is LIGHTENING FAST when I use data.* Note: At home I use WiFi on my secured Router with a password. However when I travel I use LTE Data on this phone as it is much more secure tha a Open WiFi Hot spot at say a cafe etc. This way I know I feel more secure on the Internet.+ OTG – This phone supports On the Go with the micro USB port so I can add a 256 GB flash drive with my office files pictures etc and the phone easily reads these files.+ Temperature of the battery and coolness of this phone - This phone and battery runs very cool with the Snapdragon 410 processor (the 600 & higher Snapdragon processors on other devices can run hot). With this phone's 410 cool processor the normal temp and most of the time it is running at 78 F degrees to 87 F degrees. When I download lots of apps or play games it may get up to 90 degrees for a couple of minutes but goes right down to normal temps. I have run many programs on this phone and it DOES NOT OVERHEAT. I have read that some newer smart phones will sometimes get up as high as 112 degrees this one for me has not done this.It is important to keep a phone running cooler as it will prolong the life of the phone and it is easier on the battery as well.+ Phone call Clarity/Loudness etc. - Loud enough speaker and sound is very clear best phone I used..No matter what my location using this phone for phone calls the clarity of calls is loud and clear whether on the phone's speaker headset or speaker.The front speaker on this phone is plenty loud...better than my Samsung J7 was!+ BATTERY LIFE: This phone has given me the very good battery life. And I use 100% brightness. For me even at 100 brightness if I use WiFi or Data just when I need it and then turn it off I get close to all day into the night on one single charge! (I charge nightly and the phone is at 100% ready to go the next morning). Also to save battery I turn off WiFi or Data and tap the ON OFF button (put to sleep). This way I use my phone into the night on a single charge.+ EXTERNAL SLOT FOR MICRO SD CARD (UP TO 256GB SD CARD) - This helped to sell me on this phone as I can add my personal music photos videos and more to this phone! (I placed a 64GB SD Card in this phone and I still have room left).*Keep in mind where External SD cards are concerned: Many apps can be moved to External SD card. Not all. See this article:http://www.techdroider.com/2016/02/how-to-move-apps-to-external-sd-card-on-marshmallow.html?m=1By default the apps go to your Internal storage.Actually the External SD card is meant for your personal files: music videos photos and other files. When you install apps from Playstore they install in your phone internal storage. Personally I do not have gaming apps or tons of apps so my apps are still in Internal Storage and I have plenty of space left for more apps later if needed.+ G4 Play Prints pictures and documents! I print pictures PDF documents Documents and more right from this phone! I have an HP Envy 4500 Wireless Printer...then I installed PrinterShare from the Playstore...I paid 10 dollars for the Premium version as the free one did not work as well. If you need more info regarding the Printing on Moto G4 Play please ask me in comment section.+ Music Player..The installed player is Google Play Player however I did not like it as it used too much battery/memory so I went to Playstore and installed the free Rocket Player...this uses very little battery and memory and has lots of themes easy to make Playlist etc.+ MS Office...I installed free from Playstore WJS OFFICE as I need use this 100 percent compatible MS Office compatible on the road. Works great for me. I highly recommend this free Office app.+ Reading/Creating/Editing Word Excel Text Files and much more on this phone: I downloaded a FREE APP called WPS Office (free) which I use for Office files (it reads edits and creates Office files). And it also reads PDF eBooks so there is no need to download a separate PDF Reader app. *This is a MUST have if you have to read PDF or Word Docs etc my docs are crisp and clear using this app.+ Bluetooth Speed and Performance - The Bluetooth paired quickly with several devices and copied files at a great rate of speed.+  Watching Videos online...I use an app called Internet free from Playstore and also Chrome and I watch online videos by pressing the big white arrow in center of video. I have watched all the videos I wanted on several browsers just fine.For Amazon videos there is an Amazon Video app that I discovered that I use on my Android tablet to watch my Amazon videos.CONS:- Just a couple of minor Cons I found...The phone I received did not come with a headset...no problem  as I already have a headset that works on this phone. (I prefer a Bluetooth headset because the sound quality us so much better). Amazon offers many plug in or Bluetooth headsets ar low prices.Also the charger that came with the phone is a slower charger however I have a 2 amp charger that I use and it charges this phone quickly.Bottom line: Would I buy this phone all over again? Yes in a heartbeat as the size is perfect for me.  And for the money I believe this is the best deal out there dollar for dollar. Will this phone be a good choice for you? Yes for two reasons.:1) Yes if you want a very easy to use phone.2) Yes if you have small hands and small fingers as the keyboard is small.If you have large hands and large fingers this phone may be too small for you...so you should then consider a 5.5 inch or higher screen phone.***This phone I recommend to a person wants a smaller comfortable to hold phone and also a very easy to use phone. ** Personally I love this phone because it is fits my hands perfectly easy to use fun to use and it is a beautiful phone!Thank you for reading this review. I tested the phone thoroughly before I wrote this review. If you have questions about this phone please ask me in the comment section as I am a techie type and will answer right away.,1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        15 of 15 people found the following review helpful       BEST PHONE I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!!!  November 26  2016By Martha Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is the best phone I have had in a long time!!!!  I've been a Samsung user for about 3 years and when I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 I quickly became very disappointed.  The battery life of the S7 was poor to say the least.  I was skeptical about trying a new phone but I'm so glad I did.  The battery life of the Moto G Play is AWESOME and the phone is fast and efficient.  VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!!!,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        16 of 17 people found the following review helpful       Simply and amazing piece of gear!  December 26  2016By Wade Brezina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"What do you want from a phone? For me first of all it has to be a phone -- crazy as that may be;-)  I purchased this phone mostly because my Nexus 4 was becoming too difficult to maintain a reliable phone connection as T-Mobile has been making all their improvements in LTE coverage apparently at the expense of the older technologies that the Nexus supported. Coverage is now much better and I have a phone that works well as a phone!The second most important thing for me is the ability to ask my phone for information and to be able to browse content.  Was a little worried about this as the reviews / specs I read indicate that this phone is in some ways less than the Nexus 4. In practice I find the phone to be very easy to read and it is typically very responsive.  I find it to be a very useful content browsing device.  I keep things very uncluttered. I want to know the weather so I have a widget on the home screen for that.  The app drawer gives me everything I typically use access from either one touch or a touch to a small folder and a touch.  Also have a widget for my media player and one screen over for my calendar.  In practice is seems a responsive and clear reading as my grandson's iPhone 5s and frankly I usually get better and faster answers than he does with Siri.I love that the Moto software is nearly indistinguishable from the stock Android of the Nexus. (Although I was on 5.? and this is 6.01.) There is no bloatware. There is a moto app that I have not used but read that it is limited from some of the enhancements that moto has made for their higher end phones. Seems to me that if I want more enhancements I can get them from the play store. So far I can do anything I want to do with it and have installed the apps I want.The third thing I want to do with a phone is to listen to music. I use Poweramp and with a slight bit of tweaking to the equalizer I am very happy with the music playback.  VLC player also does a great job with video files and HD movies from the SD card have played flawlessly.  One FANTASTIC bonus that I haven't had since before smart phone days is an FM radio!  A little bummed that I have to use a wired headset for this to work as I typically use a Bluetooth headset. However it was great to listen to a local broadcast while out for a walk and also to listen to my favorite NFL team.  There may be plans you can pay for to stream the NFL and enough data to stream whatever local content you want. However I don't have those plans and it is nice to be able to continue to  enjoy what I have always been able to enjoy in the days before smart phones.For a few more $ I put in a 64GB SD card. WOW!!!  A phone with 80GB for storage for under $200!!!  I really hope people will realize the significance of this and stop paying the ridiculous prices for storage charged by other phones. This is a very big deal unless you don't care about a few hundred dollars.I don't do games on my phone.  Apparently this does not have the power to do that. Seems pretty powerful to me as I can browse and watch HD movies. However FWIW the experts say this phone is under powered.  It also is lacking NFC. I don't use Google Pay and while the Nexus had NFC I never used it for anything in 3.5 years so I don't miss it.  Also doesn't have a gyroscope and I also don't miss that. The GPS can find me on a map so I am not even sure what I am missing without it.So far the only thing that I am missing and I am just going to have to learn to live without is the flashing notification LED. Will just have to get used to touching it to see if I have any notifications.The only other ""bad"" thing is the camera.  It is serviceable and that is it.  Actually got some nice Christmas shots with it so I am happy about that. However the nice ones were mostly accidental. Don't think you could ever count on this camera to take truly good pictures. I have a camera for that.Of course I want a phone that works without having to be plugged in. So far the battery performance has went beyond my expectations. Reviews say that the charging is way to slow. That is probably a good thing for long term battery life. However since it is removable I am not too concerned about that. Have not used the included slow charger yet. Probably the best long term strategy would be to plug it into that when I go to bed. So far I have just plugged it into the powered USB hub at my computer and also have tested it with my Anker PowerCore mini.  Charges fast with these methods.In summary I am an old Mac guy who happens to prefer the stock Android interface for using a smart phone. I have spent a lot of money over the years for Macintosh computers as fantastic tools to create things. (Current MBP pricing excepted.)  I don't mind paying a premium for a good tool!  I am at the core very frugal.  The ability to easily get what you want done reliably is where the value is determined.  For what I want from a phone this truly is a good tool and yet somehow I did not have to pay a premium for it. I know that for things like the camera video recording and game playing this is not a very good tool. However for what I use it for I am amazed at what a great tool it is.  Blows me away to have all this capability for about the cost of a pair of Air Buds!  Have only had the phone for a few days and I will update this review if things change but for now I would happily recommend this phone to anyone who is not looking to play intensive games or take great pictures with their phones.  As a phone and content consumption device it is well worth the money!",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        232 of 262 people found the following review helpful       Impressive for $99.  September 16  2016By dewzter,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I like this phone! I like the size clarity speed ease of use and even the 8MP camera does a fairly good job. Hopefully I can say all the same things in a few months time will tell. The Amazon offers/ads on the lockscreen are inconspicuous and not a problem at all once you access the phone the ads are gone that's $50 well saved IMO!  As soon as my Moto Play arrived I switched the SIM card from my Consumer Cellular purchased Moto G 1st Gen to the Moto Play. I also added a 16 GB SD card for a bit of a kick (I probably won't even need it). I fired it up and followed the prompts. My Google contacts loaded quickly I also used Motorola's ""Migrate"" everything transferred smooth as silk. After making sure everything worked I contacted Consumer Cellular to let them know I had upgraded phones. The only thing the service rep needed was the phone's IMEI #. She also wanted me to check and make sure I could access the Net without using Wi-Fi I did this without a problem and that was that I was good to go.  I know what the Moto Play is and isn't capable of as I've researched extensively. I've compared all the specs and capabilities of other phones at various price levels and decided the price of $99 for this phone was the absolute best bang for the buck for me. I haven't deluded myself into thinking this is the best of the best I realize the Moto Play does not have all the bells and whistles that some other phones offer but after checking prices of similar unlocked phones I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.  The important thing to me is this phone fits my needs it offers no more nor no less of what I need in a phone. In regards to going in-depth concerning the detailed specs of the Moto Play there's no need for me to cover ground already covered since other reviewers have already given excellent reviews on the specs pros and cons of the Moto Play.UPDATE; 9/24I've dropped my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars because my Moto Play gets  warm during talk use of no more than 10 minutes (CPU temps reaching 115-125). The phone also gets warm while surfing or using FM radio or YouTube after a few minutes. I never had this problem with my Moto G 1st gen while doing the same things but maybe this is normal because of a more powerful battery. I've read of this problem in several Moto G 4 reviews but no one has mentioned this in Moto Play reviews. If anyone knows if this is normal or has experienced the same problem with CPU temps reaching 115-125 on their Moto Play please reply thanks!UPDATE; 10/10/16As stated in my original post I purchased a 16 GB SD card for my MOTO PLAY. The card I purchased was a SanDisc hi-speed class 10 Micro SD card especially designed for the MOTO PLAY. I've read complaints in other reviews that the larger MOTO 4 loses connection with SD cards occasionally and have to be re-inserted. I've experienced the same problem and after having to re-insert 4 times because of lost connection I'm lowering my original 5 star rating to a 3 star rating. In every other respect (other than the phone running warm) there's still an awful lot I like about the Moto Play but I've come to realize it has it's faults but for the cost of $99 I can live with those faults. BTW I've removed the SD card and will make do without it.",0

December 4  2016By William D. Gray,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is a very solid phone.  I sold my iPhone 7 Plus due to financial constraints and use this as a replacement.  It's inferior in a few ways: no 5GHZ Wifi not Apple processor/RAM lag when running many apps or resource hogs camera & screen; however it holds up to iPhone 6 on all but the Apple component of those deficiencies.I will stress that you should buy the Amazon version the ads are not noticeable.  However there may be an issue when it's time to update the device because the Android software will need to be Amazonized before it's rolled out.  Also make sure you setup the phone with your Amazon ID because adding it later will cause issues registering the Motorola ID.  That being said for $100 there is not another phone that brings an experience close to this one.  In fact you must spend at least twice as much to get an equivalent competitor.I'm impressed.,0

November 28  2016By Alph,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A great entry/mid level smartphone for anyone wanting a versatile decent quality phone that doesn't cost several hundred dollars (true there are plenty of better phones available for more money but this one packs a lot of bang for the buck).  Great screen resolution.  Decent camera.  Good selection of pre-installed apps (I actually like the Prime Video Kindle and Music apps already loaded and ready to go) and it doesn't come loaded with a lot of useless bloatware.  The lock screen ad is unobtrusive -- it's there when you first turn on the phone but one quick swipe and it's gone and you're at the home screen (you won't see another ad til next time you turn on the phone).,0

November 15  2016By LC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great phone! Simple straight foreward non redundant settings menu. No bloatware or adds. Perfect size & thank you removable battery!!!  I kina like to see a battery that swells up due to either over charging or bad knock offs before it explodes or catches fire!!  A few of my Nokia & Samsung S5 batteries did this over the years warning me of needed replacements so no fires. No processor lag for me and camera is fine enough for most of us. You have about 11GB free internal memory.  I ditched my Samsung S5 because of AT&T OTA branded updates back in Aug locking my phone up & wiping the data. I only miss the outstanding 16 MB photos & on the fly editing of the S5. The Moto G4 play with removable battery GSM + CDMA carrier capabilities for the money is hands down the best one out there. Most newer phones have screens too large. This one is perfect!  I am not a super gamer & I have not tried a CDMA carrier yet. With Consumer Cellular just install your old sim works great!

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       with long term plan to order one of those high end top notch phones like Apple's iPhone Plus  September 19  2016By DA,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I got this phone yesterday and my plan was to use it as a backup to my dying Google Nexus 4 (now about 20% unresponsive to touching) with long term plan to order one of those high end top notch phones like Apple's  iPhone Plus Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 or Lenovo's Moto Z (Force) Droid. I still have not changed my long term plan (mostly for their camera and stereo style voice) but I feel that no need to go now on those big lines to buy in a hurry. Who knows the price for those high end top notch phones may end up dropping as much as 20 - 30 % on or after black friday and now I have the tenacity to control the urge thanks to Amazon's Play.I was worried about Play's capabilities: 2GB RAM 400 series Qualqom's Snapdragon CPU (1.2 GH) 8 MP Camera 720P Display. All of these are below mediocre. But I surfed via chrome facebook etc; played subway surfer called as far away as 5000 miles none of these mediocrities are noticeable so far. True I saw my T-Mobile bars dropped to the bottom but I had the same problem with my nexus 4. The voice and camera are also noticeably better than my nexus-4.I was impressed by the FM Radio which is full-fledged radio if you use your ear buds as antenna. I have yet to try the GPS and will hopefully update. I heard Moto has the best GPS (a-GPS) but have not tried it yet over a long drive.The promised amazon adds unlike what some said may not be removable (takes time to be 100% sure) but they show only when the phone's screen is locked. When you unlock the screen the ads will stay away. But hey most of the ads are appropriate and look better than all available android (ugly) wallpapers.The only tiny regret I have is not ordering Moto G (4th Generation without the play) for an additional $50 but going over the reviews most of them reported the supposedly better one has screen vibration problem. So all in all my ""tiny regret"" may not be valid after all.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01KBH547A,Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       A really great deal  October 22  2016By OldDog,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A great phone at a superb price.I bought this from Amazon to use on Tracfone's Verizon network. Had to go to WalMart to purchase their $10 sim BYOP activation package.I needed to  transfer from one smartphone to another. Setup on Tracfone was a breeze and the phone was active in less than 10 minutes.I went for the cheaper of the two phone options so it includes the Amazon apps but they were easy enough to get out of the way even though you can't uninstall them. Compared to the bloatware Verizon stuck on my Edge 7 the stuff on the Moto is pretty minimal.  Android 6.0.1 so plenty of stuff to customize the screen has nice touch sensitivity and the resolution is just fine. Tried a couple of quick snapshots with the camera and that looks like it will get the job done.This will be used by a disabled person for casual and emergency use so phone and text were the two biggest items.  There's over 11 gbytes open after the OS gets its bite out of the 16 gbyte system memory so just in case I ordered a 32 gbyte microSd card. I also ordered a case and screen protector; total for the sd card case and 2 glass screen protectors was less than $25.  So for less than $140 she has a phone with no payments that will cost her maybe $120 a year on Tracfone's plans.Calls are very clear and the default text app is very straightforward.  The phone this replaced was Tracfone's own LG Rebel which was an abysmal phone.,0

It came packaged great with a case screen protector earphones and charging cable with a plug. It really a beautifully designed phone its pleasing to the eye. It took a bit to get use to the power button on the side but now i actually prefer it there. It runs just as well as an expensive phone no lag no issues. It does only have 8gb of memory and the system takes up 4gb so keep that in mind but with my sd card i haven't had any memory issues.

Unlocked Cell Phones,B018IZ0SWI,BLU Advance 5.0 - Unlocked Dual Sim…,        448 of 470 people found the following review helpful       Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen ...  July 30  2016By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"For $70 I think you are getting your money's worth.  The phone comes with a case plastic screen protector earphones microUSB cable and an outlet adapter.  Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen protector as even people who are in the market for budget phones will typically have to buy those as well. For the price or even for double the price I don't think there are many phones that have much better specs.  The newest version android quad core 1.3ghz processor 1gb ram ~294 pixels per inch and weighing in at only 142g.I've noticed some reviews saying they had trouble opening the back of the phone to insert the battery. They are right that there are no direct instructions provided for that which certainly should have been included in a start-up manual.  If you look at the phone with the screen towards you in the top right corner of the phone has a small indent that should allow you to open the back with a low to medium amount of force.The phone itself looks nice and runs pretty smoothly.  I've maybe noticed a slight lag when opening some programs for the first time in a while.  I've also noticed some widgets are not properly responsive if you don't open the program for that widget before hand.  Not sure if that's an issue with the phone itself the OS or the apps though it's likely not the apps.If you have very basic phone needs this phone is a prime choice especially since you don't have to buy a screen or case.  As for the earphones I would have gladly paid something like $3 less and not have received those.Also since there's a Pokemon GO craze going on right now this phone can play the game but not on the augmented reality mode since I do not believe it contains a gyroscope.I've only had the phone for about five days so I will update the review if my opinions change on it.Edit 1:Have had the phone for almost three weeks now and am still very satisfied with my purchase.  I forgot to mention what carrier I am using.  I am on T-mobile and everything seems to work just fine even though on the compatibility rating it says ""partial"" coverage for 3G and no coverage for 4G.  I'm sure there is a very technical explanation for all this but my phone usually tells me I'm on 3G or 4G when I'm not connected to wifi.  Battery life seems to be pretty good.Edit 2:Have had the phone for a month now and still like it a lot.  I am having some issues with the headphone jack however.  When I plug in my headphones sometimes it doesn't register to the phone for some reason and while sound comes out of the headphones it doesn't cancel the sound coming out of the speaker.  I've tested this with multiple pairs of headphones so it seems to be a problem with the outlet.  If I plug the headphones in slowly then it works fine.",0

April 11  2016By Christine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After reading all the reviews about this phone over & over again and weighing my options I finally purchased the phone and was able to receive it that same day. I had low expectations assuming that it would have very low quality screen & horrible resolution horrible camera quality & little to next to none storage --- BUT... when I did a thorough look at the phone it was a very nice decent Android. I assume that the screen would feel like plastic but it's GLASS nice smooth touch to it. (Since it was hard glass I quickly ordered a tempered glass screen for protection.) The back cover had a great texture almost imitating leather with a rubber feel to it. I purchased the phone in the color white (It was a nice pure white/clean) so I also bought a case to protect not just the phone itself but the color so that it wouldn't dull over time. I don't take pictures much & Im not too big on downloading apps so the storage issue wasn't bothering me much but I did stick a 16gig SD card in just in case. (I was able to download basic apps like FB Insta Snapchat without any issues) Camera quality isn't all that great but it's decent in great lighting or with flash on. (I will insert a picture of my dog taken by the BLU phone) This phone has a not so great battery life it drains as soon as I unplugged it and started using it. It'll probably only give you a few hours of life if you use it constantly on&off at full brightness. Out in the sun the phone screen can be hard to see too so be aware of that. I was able to compare the phone to my sisters Samsung Prime Core phone and it looked GREAT next to it. It felt lighter than the Samsung & looked as if I paid $100 + for it. It's not the greatest phone if you compare it to the top notch $500 & Plus phones like iPhones Samsung's Galaxy's & etc but it's great phone to start off your teen kids with. Overall I have to say that I do love this phone for the price range and its 5"" screen size.",1

I've had all Iphone products Samsung Nexus 6 etc and this phone is not them.  However this phone resets the bar on what the others should be.  Will this phone do 99% of what just about every user demands?  Dual sims work flawlessly runs all the apps in the PlayStore.  You won't be able to just install everything your hearts desire you'll have to manage storage memory.  There is a slot for a up to a 64 gb card for media and apps that allow you to move them to the SD card but you'll see that few apps can be moved to SD card anymore (not the phone's fault).  The screen is not HD or Retna but it's 100% acceptable.  Good viewing angles clear bright etc.  I've had phones that had poor displays and you couldn't see the screen if you tilted the phone this is not the case with this phone.  Battery life is really really good.  I run dual sims (work/personal) and I'm 60% when I go to bed.  Build quality is much better than I expected very solid.  Call volume is a bit low but this seems to be a common issue with Android not the hardware.For $60 you will not be disappointed.  You'll probably wonder what an extra $600 for a high end phone really gives you.My family member also has a Blu phone different model and it's been 100% for 1.5 years.  She loves it and laughs when she tells people she paid less than $100 for it.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B018IZ0SWI,BLU Advance 5.0 - Unlocked Dual Sim…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Decent phone but terrible camera and very little memory  December 8  2016By Don Eddleman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I brought this phone abroad with me for a few months because it was unlocked and I didn't want to risk having my more expensive phone stolen. Overall this phone for a backup is a pretty good choice. It works decently and has a good battery life. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or higher is because this phone has so little space for apps on it. You can add an SD card and I added a 64 gb one thinking that would allow me to install whatever I needed. However most apps cannot be put onto the SD card and also even apps that can be put either completely or partially install to the phone first and then have to be moved to the SD card which kind of defeats the purpose (there is a setting where you can theoretically have it install to the SD card first but in my experience it didn't work). 4GB sounds like a good amount of memory but most of it is taken up by junk apps that you can't delete. I currently have a gmail appgoogle maps  groupme whats app venmo and a pdf reader on my phone (some of which are partially on the sd card) and my phone is completely out of space. Also theres a few random bugs (might just be my phone though) for example if i turn brightness on when my phone goes to sleep the screen will not come back on unless i hard reset it (not a problem though if the brightness is kept off). Also the camera takes really awful pictures (I generally use my phone to take pictures of notes for class but it is impossible with this phone to do so). Overall though its cheap and works pretty well in doing the basics so if you need a backup I recommend it but if you want a full time phone I would not get this one purely because of the lack of space.,0

It came super quick  July 15  2016By Waukesha04,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My Samsung S5 took a swan dive off a treadmill so I had to get something else. My contract is not up until November. I came across this BLU phone with fairly good reviews. It came super quick nice work Amazon.The phone itself is a good basic smart phone for $59. Its appropriate for someone who just needs a phone and will use some basic apps. The phone is nice and thin and I like the case. The touch screen is not that responsive as a Samsung or my work I-Phone 6s. But obviosuly its a fraction of the price. Its a little harder to type on then the bigger names. The other two things I notice is 1. its just slower (starting up opening apps scrolling loading) again its a cheap price and fair enough. 2. The camera is not very good especially in low light. I can live with these issues for a few months. I just needed a hold  me over phone. It started up perfectly and accepted my AT&T SIM card without issues. The interface for email contact and text is a little different but fine. Bluetooth and WiFi work well.  If you love your phone and are on it constantly you might want something better. If you need a basic smart phone its totally worth the money.,0

August 7  2016By Tim C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This device does not have very many reviews like other Blu devices. I have ordered many Blu devices in the past and most have at least a few hundred reviews. These have been very helpful in allowing me to decide on whether I am interested in the device. So I will post my review here and offer some insight for those interested.In the box you receive the typical Blu package: the phone a power adapter earbuds a TPU case and a screen protector. All of these items arrived intact and met all expectations. The screen protector that came with this device had some quirks that some may want to be aware of. Unlike most screen protectors this one was NOT completely transparent. The screen protector had a special color print for the bezel of the device covering the white face and replacing it with a rose gold finish. This was fine except that the size of the print on the screen protector was slightly off making it very difficult to place the protector without covering the screen or the ports. I was able to get down pretty close but the added printing made it much more difficult to apply.When installing the battery and SIM I ran into the same difficulty removing the backplate of the device. Once removed however things were easy. Do not let this deter you from purchasing this phone. The phone booted up nicely with a vivid and colorful display and otherwise had 0 issues. A great phone for the price thus far.,1

Overall I have been satisfied with my purchase. I inserted my sim (AT&T) booted up and immediately got a signal. It sensed all the data on my sim card that I also installed. While there is an easy learning curve and it isn't as refined as some of the top end phones being sold for under a hundred bucks it is hard to beat. I would recommend this phone just don't expect it to be the latest Samsung or IPhone. It will provide you with talk text data and allow most of the functions of the other phones. It doesn't have a lot of built in memory so plan on using a sim card. They are cheap enough. Camera and speaker are just OK. For my needs it does the job just fine.,0

It came packaged great with a case screen protector earphones and charging cable with a plug. It really a beautifully designed phone its pleasing to the eye. It took a bit to get use to the power button on the side but now i actually prefer it there. It runs just as well as an expensive phone no lag no issues. It does only have 8gb of memory and the system takes up 4gb so keep that in mind but with my sd card i haven't had any memory issues. If you are looking for an affordable phone that works like an expensive phone this is it. This phone runs just as well as my lg g4 did and for a hell of a lot less money!

Unlocked Cell Phones,B018IZ0VLQ,BLU Advance 5.0 - Unlocked Dual Sim…,        448 of 470 people found the following review helpful       Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen ...  July 30  2016By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"For $70 I think you are getting your money's worth.  The phone comes with a case plastic screen protector earphones microUSB cable and an outlet adapter.  Very smart and economical IMO to include the case and screen protector as even people who are in the market for budget phones will typically have to buy those as well. For the price or even for double the price I don't think there are many phones that have much better specs.  The newest version android quad core 1.3ghz processor 1gb ram ~294 pixels per inch and weighing in at only 142g.I've noticed some reviews saying they had trouble opening the back of the phone to insert the battery. They are right that there are no direct instructions provided for that which certainly should have been included in a start-up manual.  If you look at the phone with the screen towards you in the top right corner of the phone has a small indent that should allow you to open the back with a low to medium amount of force.The phone itself looks nice and runs pretty smoothly.  I've maybe noticed a slight lag when opening some programs for the first time in a while.  I've also noticed some widgets are not properly responsive if you don't open the program for that widget before hand.  Not sure if that's an issue with the phone itself the OS or the apps though it's likely not the apps.If you have very basic phone needs this phone is a prime choice especially since you don't have to buy a screen or case.  As for the earphones I would have gladly paid something like $3 less and not have received those.Also since there's a Pokemon GO craze going on right now this phone can play the game but not on the augmented reality mode since I do not believe it contains a gyroscope.I've only had the phone for about five days so I will update the review if my opinions change on it.Edit 1:Have had the phone for almost three weeks now and am still very satisfied with my purchase.  I forgot to mention what carrier I am using.  I am on T-mobile and everything seems to work just fine even though on the compatibility rating it says ""partial"" coverage for 3G and no coverage for 4G.  I'm sure there is a very technical explanation for all this but my phone usually tells me I'm on 3G or 4G when I'm not connected to wifi.  Battery life seems to be pretty good.Edit 2:Have had the phone for a month now and still like it a lot.  I am having some issues with the headphone jack however.  When I plug in my headphones sometimes it doesn't register to the phone for some reason and while sound comes out of the headphones it doesn't cancel the sound coming out of the speaker.  I've tested this with multiple pairs of headphones so it seems to be a problem with the outlet.  If I plug the headphones in slowly then it works fine.",0

April 11  2016By Christine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After reading all the reviews about this phone over & over again and weighing my options I finally purchased the phone and was able to receive it that same day. I had low expectations assuming that it would have very low quality screen & horrible resolution horrible camera quality & little to next to none storage --- BUT... when I did a thorough look at the phone it was a very nice decent Android. I assume that the screen would feel like plastic but it's GLASS nice smooth touch to it. (Since it was hard glass I quickly ordered a tempered glass screen for protection.) The back cover had a great texture almost imitating leather with a rubber feel to it. I purchased the phone in the color white (It was a nice pure white/clean) so I also bought a case to protect not just the phone itself but the color so that it wouldn't dull over time. I don't take pictures much & Im not too big on downloading apps so the storage issue wasn't bothering me much but I did stick a 16gig SD card in just in case. (I was able to download basic apps like FB Insta Snapchat without any issues) Camera quality isn't all that great but it's decent in great lighting or with flash on. (I will insert a picture of my dog taken by the BLU phone) This phone has a not so great battery life it drains as soon as I unplugged it and started using it. It'll probably only give you a few hours of life if you use it constantly on&off at full brightness. Out in the sun the phone screen can be hard to see too so be aware of that. I was able to compare the phone to my sisters Samsung Prime Core phone and it looked GREAT next to it. It felt lighter than the Samsung & looked as if I paid $100 + for it. It's not the greatest phone if you compare it to the top notch $500 & Plus phones like iPhones Samsung's Galaxy's & etc but it's great phone to start off your teen kids with. Overall I have to say that I do love this phone for the price range and its 5"" screen size.",1

I've had all Iphone products Samsung Nexus 6 etc and this phone is not them.  However this phone resets the bar on what the others should be.  Will this phone do 99% of what just about every user demands?  Dual sims work flawlessly runs all the apps in the PlayStore.  You won't be able to just install everything your hearts desire you'll have to manage storage memory.  There is a slot for a up to a 64 gb card for media and apps that allow you to move them to the SD card but you'll see that few apps can be moved to SD card anymore (not the phone's fault).  The screen is not HD or Retna but it's 100% acceptable.  Good viewing angles clear bright etc.  I've had phones that had poor displays and you couldn't see the screen if you tilted the phone this is not the case with this phone.  Battery life is really really good.  I run dual sims (work/personal) and I'm 60% when I go to bed.  Build quality is much better than I expected very solid.  Call volume is a bit low but this seems to be a common issue with Android not the hardware.For $60 you will not be disappointed.  You'll probably wonder what an extra $600 for a high end phone really gives you.My family member also has a Blu phone different model and it's been 100% for 1.5 years.  She loves it and laughs when she tells people she paid less than $100 for it.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B018IZ0VLQ,BLU Advance 5.0 - Unlocked Dual Sim…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Decent phone but terrible camera and very little memory  December 8  2016By Don Eddleman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I brought this phone abroad with me for a few months because it was unlocked and I didn't want to risk having my more expensive phone stolen. Overall this phone for a backup is a pretty good choice. It works decently and has a good battery life. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or higher is because this phone has so little space for apps on it. You can add an SD card and I added a 64 gb one thinking that would allow me to install whatever I needed. However most apps cannot be put onto the SD card and also even apps that can be put either completely or partially install to the phone first and then have to be moved to the SD card which kind of defeats the purpose (there is a setting where you can theoretically have it install to the SD card first but in my experience it didn't work). 4GB sounds like a good amount of memory but most of it is taken up by junk apps that you can't delete. I currently have a gmail appgoogle maps  groupme whats app venmo and a pdf reader on my phone (some of which are partially on the sd card) and my phone is completely out of space. Also theres a few random bugs (might just be my phone though) for example if i turn brightness on when my phone goes to sleep the screen will not come back on unless i hard reset it (not a problem though if the brightness is kept off). Also the camera takes really awful pictures (I generally use my phone to take pictures of notes for class but it is impossible with this phone to do so). Overall though its cheap and works pretty well in doing the basics so if you need a backup I recommend it but if you want a full time phone I would not get this one purely because of the lack of space.,0

It came super quick  July 15  2016By Waukesha04,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My Samsung S5 took a swan dive off a treadmill so I had to get something else. My contract is not up until November. I came across this BLU phone with fairly good reviews. It came super quick nice work Amazon.The phone itself is a good basic smart phone for $59. Its appropriate for someone who just needs a phone and will use some basic apps. The phone is nice and thin and I like the case. The touch screen is not that responsive as a Samsung or my work I-Phone 6s. But obviosuly its a fraction of the price. Its a little harder to type on then the bigger names. The other two things I notice is 1. its just slower (starting up opening apps scrolling loading) again its a cheap price and fair enough. 2. The camera is not very good especially in low light. I can live with these issues for a few months. I just needed a hold  me over phone. It started up perfectly and accepted my AT&T SIM card without issues. The interface for email contact and text is a little different but fine. Bluetooth and WiFi work well.  If you love your phone and are on it constantly you might want something better. If you need a basic smart phone its totally worth the money.,0

August 7  2016By Tim C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This device does not have very many reviews like other Blu devices. I have ordered many Blu devices in the past and most have at least a few hundred reviews. These have been very helpful in allowing me to decide on whether I am interested in the device. So I will post my review here and offer some insight for those interested.In the box you receive the typical Blu package: the phone a power adapter earbuds a TPU case and a screen protector. All of these items arrived intact and met all expectations. The screen protector that came with this device had some quirks that some may want to be aware of. Unlike most screen protectors this one was NOT completely transparent. The screen protector had a special color print for the bezel of the device covering the white face and replacing it with a rose gold finish. This was fine except that the size of the print on the screen protector was slightly off making it very difficult to place the protector without covering the screen or the ports.

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01GINVN1W,Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 32 GB…,        791 of 839 people found the following review helpful       Moto Reclaims the Budget Crown… For Now  July 12  2016By Eduardo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pros+ Excellent Screen+ Great Camera+ Clean Android 6.0 Marshmallow+ Compatible with all major networks+ Great PriceCons- No NFC- No longer waterproof- Bland Design- Competition is Getting Better- Single SpeakerShould You Buy: YesActual Value: $200Contrary to what most reviewers though I thought Motorola really dropped the ball last year. The Moto G of 2015 had a weak processor low resolution screen and an okay but not great camera. Perfectly fine in 2014 but not in 2015 and definitely not now. Companies like Alcatel ASUS and even small companies like Honor (Huawei) were offering better value for money. But this year Motorola definitely brought its best. But is it enough to be the best budget phone of the year? In short yes. The Moto G4 is the best budget phone you should buy today. The question you should ask yourself is will it be the best value this year?- Design -Motorola has never made the Moto G the stylish one of its lineup. True with Moto Maker this can be a very personalized phone. But the overall design has been plain. This year that trend continues. The new Moto G is plainer than the  with a simple plain back and a simple flat front. Personally I like it. It was built to be a solid reliable phone and it doesn’t try to be something it’s not. What I don’t like is the lack of more premium material. Blu and Huawei have added metal to the mix which feels a lot better in the hand compared to the simple plastic build. It’s a great phone but it could still be better.- Screen -The screen is a 5.5 inch 1080p panel which is a huge improvement from the old 720p panel on last generation’s phone. I honestly would’ve prefered a 5.2 inch panel but that’s just a personal preference. This is a very good panel as a whole but certainly not the best screen available. Text is really sharp and colors are vibrant enough. Whites tend to be slightly on the blue side but it is not that noticeable and contrast is good but not excellent. Still for a phone that cost only $199 it is a great screen and certainly an upgrade if you are coming from last year’s Moto G.- Software -Motorola has kept their reputation of keeping stock Android alive with this phone. Everything is stock and the few additions that Motorola added to the phone are definitely appreciated. Active lock screen is still here and twist gestures are also back from last year. But what makes this different compared to other phones is the Amazon ad experience that allows it to be cheaper than a plain stock version. So are the Amazon additions something that affects the experience? In short not really. General usage is just what you’d expect from a typical Android phone and it is hardly noticeable that you have Amazon ads built in. Well when I say hardly noticeable I mean in general use. You will always be reminded of the Amazon ads when you unlock which takes up the entire screen and shrinks to a notification when there are other notifications on the screen. You can easily replace the screen lock with something like the Next Lock Screen app (available on Google Play) and you can get rid of all signs of Amazon ads. Some apps are kind of bloatware but they are all from Amazon so you can take it or leave it.- Performance -The Moto G4 comes packing an octa-core Snapdragon 617 paired with 2GB of RAM (at least on my version). This is still a decent package and seeing as most of the competition will be using this chip there isn’t much to complain about. The phone works smoothly and games like Asphalt 8 and Pokemon Go run well. Benchmarks show that the Moto G4 is right in the middle of the pack ahead of the Sony Xperia M4 and the Nexus 7 (2013). It falls short compared to the 800 series of phones but the gap is slowly but surely closing in. For the price it definitely packs more value for money and keeps the phone running smooth and quick. MicroSD card support is always welcome especially because it only has 16 GB of storage which easily fills up. Battery life is too soon to tell but today at work it survived the entire day with constant use and it is going towards 5 hours of screen on time. This is looking good and I will update later to confirm whether it stays like that.- Camera -The 13MP back camera and the 5 MP selfie camera are good but not the best available. The sensor appears to be the same sensor as last year’s Moto G. And in some aspects it shows. Photos in bright light look vivid and detailed contrast is good  and focus is really fast. However dim the lights and grain starts to find its way onto images that look decent but good. Low light shots are clearly this camera’s weakness with the sensor not able to grab onto details without creating a muddy image. The 5MP selfie cam works great for Snapchat and Instagram; great detail if a bit mute and flat. But for a $199 phone it falls right into place within its competitors. Just don’t expect anything mind blowing.- Conclusion -Motorola has  without a doubt made the best Moto G ever and the best budget phone. The design is good build quality is excellent and the camera is decent enough. The screen while an improvement is good but not great. OverallI can’t find anything to fault this phone. But the real problem is the competition. Alcatel’s Idol 4 looks to be improving on everything the Moto G has and the ASUS Zenfone 3 looks really beautiful to hold. The Moto G has stock Android and the (sort of) promise of getting updates faster. But is that really enough to be the best budget phone of 2016? Only time will tell. If you need a phone now or just want a guaranteed good experience on a budget then go ahead and buy the Moto G. But if you can afford a little more and want the absolute best I’d recommend waiting to see if the Alcatel or the ASUS can deliver a solid experience.,1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01GINVN1W,Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 32 GB…,        281 of 300 people found the following review helpful       Moto G (4th Generation) Hits the Sweet Spot  July 15  2016By Adamantus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've gotten a couple Moto G's in the past for my sons and they liked them so when the Amazon branded Moto G 4th Generation phone became available I jumped on it - the discount is nice and the first few days there was an initial extra $25 discount.I received the phone on the release day - July 12. I am using this on the Ting GSM network which operates on T-Mobile. I put the Sim in and it simply worked. I didn't even need to change the APN - everything worked flawlessly - cellular service data and messaging.Pluses:Nice 1080 display - I'm coming from a LG-G3 with a 2K screen and actually like this one better. It doesn't have the resolution of the high priced phone but to my 60 year-old eyes the contrast is better -I know it's not using as much energy with the lesser amount of pixels.Ergonomics - it's got a nice hand-feel. They've changed the design from the curved back which I thought would be more difficult to handle but it's still a pretty thin phone and I've had no problems handling it with my medium sized hands. The back is a very nice texturized rubber which is quite grippy. The sides however are a bit slippery. I solved this with a cheap thin cover. It's also a bit tall (see the CONS).Sound- a lot better than I expected. Of course it doesn't have Dolby speakers or even stereo speakers but it's pretty good. I can actually listen to this for a while without switching to my Jambox-  it can get pretty loud without distorting much.Connectivity - Once again though this is a budget phone it does beat my previous LG-G3. Bluetooth connects faster and the phone connects more reliably to my office wireless network. It connected flawlessly to my car.Quick charge. This phone has Qualcomm's Quick Charge 2.0 and a Quick Charge Charger comes with the phone. Very fast charging - I just came home with the phone on 63% and 20 minutes later it's on 89%. What a pleasure.Responsiveness - I haven't noticed any stuttering or sluggishness. I don't play games so I can't evaluate the phone for that. I love the keyboard response and you can dial in the exact amount of tactile feedback you like.SD card capability - I always like the fact that one can add additional memory and the fact that Android can now configure an SD card as internal memory makes it even more valuable.Camera - the camera is fine. I love when the tech reviewers have to compare a phone's camera to the highest performer. Of course a $600 -$700 phone will have a better camera. But this takes pictures that are just as good as the expensive cameras did a couple of years ago and the reviewers were happy with those.CONS:Lacks the fingerprint sensor - a nice feature but I can live without it.Lacks NFC - so I can't use Android Pay. (though I personally haven't found many places that use it)The phone has a lot of real estate at the top and bottom of the phone about one-half inch above and one-half inch below the screen. I've had other phones which were not too much bigger than the screen itself.SUMMARYI've decided to move to budget phones from the high spec phones. I pay less initially skip insurance and don't sweat if it is lost or stolen. I can replace $150 without too much pain - $600 hurts. This phone though inexpensive gives me enough quality and performance that I don't miss my expensive smart phone at all. As I said in the title - this phone hits the sweet spot for me - I really like it.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01GINVN1W,Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 32 GB…,        507 of 545 people found the following review helpful       Excellent piece of kit  July 12  2016By BlackLotus,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This phone overall is a good product when you factor in the price specs and use-case.  I've owned many phones (a hobby that the wife disagrees with!).  This phone will work for 95% of people and is excellent overall.We'll start with the actual device:The specs are clearly listed and all that jazz so I won’t go over that.  The phone feels well in the hand and I’m coming from the rather large Nexus 6.  It’s a thin phone and while it is almost as tall many phones it feels a lot less wide.  I have big hands and thought I’d want the biggest phone.  I have to say phones like this Moto G4 are about the sweet spot for me.The volume buttons are easy and I rarely push those as I set my phone to completely silent 98% of the time and once I’ve adjusted my calling volumes and such I don’t fuss with them.  It’s the power button that’s a bit more difficult and a sore point on otherwise great hardware.  It is textured compared to the volume rocker but even with that it’s almost undisguisable from it.  I have a hard time pushing it with my right hand using my thumb but left handed and using my index finger is much easier.  I luckily hold my phone leftie mostly so not a problem but the button doesn’t push as easily as it should and it requires an odd angle.  This is probably the only physical detriment to the phone – otherwise it’s great in the hand.And yes this base model Moto G4 comes with the turbo-charger.  There was a lot of misinformation early on if that was included - it is.Android OS:This runs a custom version of Android but it's pretty close to stock.  Also there aren't really any phones that run stock Android as Google's own line of phones runs many proprietary apps and code that isn't 'stock'. The basic apps are included and you get ALL of Amazon's related apps and services - even some that are essentially duplicates.  You can disable what you don't want through apps settings.  I did keep many Amazon apps and they are just the Play store ones and function quite well.  I disabled a few of the other stock apps such as Google's music videos etc.  I use other things for this and it saves memory on the phone and space in the app drawer.The overall OS is snappy it does lag a bit if you open larger/intensive apps or you are going through things quickly.  If you keep your open apps to a reasonable amount (not 30 apps and 17 Chrome tabs) the phone runs just as well as my old Nexus 6 or other recent phones.  It plays games fine again there might be a jitter or two here but I've had the best of phones do that.The other included software stuff that is nice is an FM radio that Moto usually adds.  Data may be unavailable or you may be on a limited plan and if you want music this can be a life saver.  I'd had an original Moto G back in the day and was on a tight budget - free music came in handy!  The ambient screen feature is cool too.  If you pull the phone up to you or out of your pocket a mostly blacked screen shows and you can see the unlock area and any notifications you may have.  It also shows the battery indicator with a % too!The dreaded lock screen apps.  I'm a bit torn on this as it doesn't work exactly like my Fire HD 7 tablet.  That always has a nice add up but you can swipe away as you open the device and I've never accidentally opened an ad.  I haven't opened an ad on this phone yet either unless I meant to but at times when you unlock the phone it brings up the ad that you have to unlock again.  This seemed to happen every few times I'd open the phone.  It's jarring when you pull the phone up and the ambient screen is on and you unlock and BAM AD!  I get it was why the phone was heavily discounted but a lot of extra swiping is not fun.  As a note - as of now it seems Amazon worked around putting another lock screen app on to bypass theirs.  You can do this but their ads will still pop up after you unlock with the new lock screen.  Additionally and this is a major drawback to certain people they've literally disabled the ability to bypass the lock screen completely.  On any other Android device you can change how you unlock the phone - swipe to unlock PIN fingerprint (if available) or you can choose none.  If you don't pick any when you hit your power button you go right to your home screen.  Amazon has in a rather crude way disabled this.  When I went in to try to turn any screen off it just backs you out.  Very annoying.  It also says amz or the like in many areas pertaining to the software so they have put a lot of their own code into the phone.  Updates for the device will be a TBA affair I guess - again I'll write back if more is discovered.My phone did update already a small 10mb file to 'improve calling'. I didn't have issues before and the update came a day after getting the phone.  So someone is pushing updates.Screen:The screen is pretty good and overall vibrant and sharp for the size.  It's not a 1440p screen and it isn't the largest screen out there but that's partially why I got it - I was tired of the phablet size and I'm a larger guy with big hands even.  For the size and resolution it's a very good combo though and my eyes don't mind looking at it.  I've used all the special LCD screens and the AMOLED ones - I was tired of the eye searing colors on the AMOLED and the hard to read in sunlight and the burn-in issues.  This screen in the bright Phoenix AZ sun is very readable.  Colors are pretty true after I set the screen on the normal setting in the menus.  It has a vibrant feature that ironically made the screen and colors look washed out.Another HUGE plus for this screen is the fact I noticed no bleed through or bright spots.  I put a black screen on in my very dark house and the brightness was uniform and I didn't see any light bleed.  This is very impressive for a phone in this category.  I've had flagship phones with these issues to the point it was annoying.  I'll report back over time if this changes.Also the touch screen is sensitive but not as sensitive as some phones.  This can be good and bad.  I'm always torn on what I want but less sensitive means I'm not accidentally dialing the mother-in-law after I end another conversation saving me time!  Again the touch sensitivity is uniform across the screen.  Also the screen is very resilient no bending or spots that pop up near the edge.Camera(s):I'm adding this as an edit as I forgot about it!  The camera is middle of the road but takes very quick pictures.  Moto has added more over the stock camera app such as sliding the zoom circle to adjust white exposure.  They also added things like shake to change camera.  The rear camera is quick as I said and takes adequate pictures.  They are clear HDR mode obviously helps with contrast and making things in the picture 'pop'.The front camera is actually very good especially given the mid-level specs of the phone.  It's crystal clear and better than any other front camera I've had on a phone.  It would more than suffice for the night out selfie or video chat.Battery:The battery life so far has been impressive.  I got the phone out of the box charged pretty full (over 80%).  I did the full set up played some games logged into my apps again.  I'd say I was at about 60% after all that.  I know that's not the most accurate without screen on time or such but Android's set up and downloading a few dozen apps and updates over wifi is battery intense.  As another review has already said though this puppy heats up quickly.  Charging it I noticed it got warm pretty fast and when it was downloading over wifi it got warm too.  I've noticed it getting warm playing games but this could be the battery and/or the CPU causing it - I'm guessing both.  I will update if I notice battery life becomes noticeably worse before its time.Connectivity/data/calling:This phone can work on all 4 major networks and I'm using a GSM carrier.  I won't review my carrier as you can bring this phone to pretty much any prepaid or postpaid option out there.  LTE is strong on this phone and data speeds are just as fast as my other phones I tested against in my house.  VoLTE works well on this phone and is crisp as ever.  The 3G (UMTS/HSPA) on this phone works well too and calling is again pretty clear.  Speeds are also very fast.  There is no carrier aggregation yet where I live so I can't tell you how that works but I imagine speeds are even better.More specifics on the few calls I've made - nobody has complained about static or background noises.  I hear them very well and the volume is acceptable to even a bit loud.  No dropped calls yet and no data issues either.  The phone paired instantly in my newer model car (car has built in Bluetooth).  Sounds crystal clear over the Bluetooth and also streaming music played well.  The speaker is also pretty loud and while it's only on one part of the phone (my Nexus 6 had stereo) it sounds just fine for a small device.  It's not mind-blasting like front row to the Rolling Stones but it's acceptable for calls and such.Overall and conclusion:Yes this is a great phone at the price.  Yes you have to deal with Amazon ads but that was clearly a part of the deal.  The phone is equal to a $600+ flagship in 95% of the ways and really the phone would work for 95% of people as I mentioned.  It does show it a budget phone with the heat issues on the battery and/or CPU but my old Nexus 6 did the same thing. It feels good in the hand and looks like any other slab style phone these days so it won't be turning heads but does a phone need to?  If you are in the market to upgrade from a couple year old phone or looking to replace a recent broken one this is a great deal.  If you have a newer flagship phone keep it as it's equal or better than this most likely - but keep the Moto G line in mind when you want to upgrade in a couple years.So for the price that Amazon offers this with special ads and the overall package the Moto G4 offers I’d say it’s a definite buy if you you’re in the market as I said above.  It would make an excellent phone for a young teen college grad dad wife friend or really anyone.  It would also make a great back up phone for those times where you may want to use a ‘beater phone’ – ie camping vacation etc.Edit on 7/19/2016:A few more things - I've added a couple pictures.  These are taken at night I'll get some daylight pictures soon but I figured indoor and low light pictures are more telling on how good a camera is.  This one does surprisingly well still - it's well within or above this category of phone. The picture of the stuff on the table is in a well lit room with the settings all on auto - I did tap to focus as the only adjustment and upped the white a little to match the room brightness.  The second picture of the TV is a very dark room with HDR on (flash cannot be on too) - it's not the best but at least it looks 'OK' for a dark picture.  The last picture of the bench/door were in a pretty dim hallway with the flash on (no HDR again can't both be on).The other more egregious update is I had to get the phone exchanged already from Amazon.  The issue I listed above about the power button was big - it almost wouldn't push it and I could only get it to register a push if I was very forceful and pushed on the top part.  The replacement button is noticeably better and has much better travel and can be pushed easier - so there are some QC issues on the hardware here.  Given it was a defect out of the box I was able to get an exchange but only time will tell about it lasting.Edit 10/27/2016:I used the phone on and off for quite a while - but I finally gave it to my mother.  She broke her ancient Galaxy S3 (time to go anyway).  We popped her SIM from the S3 into this and off it went.  Calls LTE data all work very well on VZW too (I was previously using it on T-Mobile).  She loves it and says it's great for her.  No issues with the power button either so hopefully the original one I received was a fluke.,1

Klein,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"OK first off this review is about the phone and the support for it.  I will first say: buyer beware...  Amazon does not support this device Motorola does...  And that is about the worst possible thing.  They will try to charge you to replace an in warranty phone with no damage. Or wait up to a month for their slow process to return your old phone with just a new battery and all the while try to ""solve"" you problems with the everyday reset your phone do a hard reboot etc and do everything in their power to avoid a warranty repair...OK on to my experience...  I bought this phone as a cheap stop gap device as my old phone was recalled and I didn't want to buy an expensive last gen device with all the new ones coming out in the spring.  I purchased this in November by December it was overheating (Too hot to even hold) lagging and couldn't be off battery for more than an hour without losing 100% of the battery and frying your hand.  I contacted Motorola and they wanted to either charge $25 bucks to send me a new phone with a $499 ""hold fee"" or I could send them the phone they ""fix"" it then return it.  So since I only paid about $150 I opted for the latter.  This was December 4th...  I got my device back on January 11th and you could tell it had only had the battery replaced I know this as all the issues still exist and the plastic where it had overheated was still melted.  It still lags it now lasts 4 hours off cord now but still gets super hot...As to the amazon ads they were nothing and actually kind of helpful at times as it knew what I was searching on Amazon and targeted the ads...  But good luck if you ever need service even warranty service as you will not be pleased...I cannot in good conscience recommend this phone.  If Amazon handled warranty work it would be awesome but Motorola's warranty service stinks...  I think I'd rather have risked my exploding phone for an extra 4 months than dealt with this fiasco.  This put me off all Motorola products...  I'd give it negative stars if I could...",0

Edelstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"We got this phone for me wife. She really likes it coming off an iPhone 5. Since I'm ""tech support"" for her and did the setup I do have some first-hand experience. We mainly switched to get off of our high-cost Verizon Wireless plan in favor of a much lower cost alternative. We settled on Republic Wireless for now. My wife likes the size of the screen it's clarity (although not as good as my iPhone 6 Plus in my opinion) and the ease of use. There were a few challenges to overcome coming from the iPhone and I found totally acceptable solutions for them.One challenge was photos. All he photos were on her iPhone and in iCloud. I installed the Google Photos app on her iPhone to upload all her photos to her Google account. The Photos app installed on on Moto G then downloaded all her photos onto that phone. Also configured the new phone to automatically backup photos which was important because my wife also has an iPad. The Google Photos app on the iPad is also installed on the iPad so that  now the photos are accessible on all devices just like they were with Apple Photos and iCloud. She now just uses Google Photos instead of Apple Photos.The other challenge was iTunes music. But that proved to be straight forward with ""Double Twist"" and their free app on the Mac and their $5 wireless-connection app on the phone. Now with just an extra step or two my wife can easily keep her iTunes synced with the Moto G. To be honest. Double Twist took a bit of tinkering to get going mostly due to some issues in her iTunes library. But now it's working very well. Make a change in iTunes go to Double Twist and press sync and it's done.Double Twist is also nice on the phone because it's much more iTunes like than the Apple Music which I think is a bloated confusing mess. iTunes isn't much better in my opinion but at least now the interfaces are consistent.Other than this one renegade Android phone we are an all Apple house and there is no access to Apple TV for example from the phone. But that's not an issue for us because we have two other iPads and my iPhone and two Macs if we need to share from one of those Apple devices to ATV (which is rare).All in all considering we took her monthly phone cost from about $60 to about $23 a month and she hasn't given up any significant functionality it's a good choice for us based on our level of data usage. I'll be following in her footsteps in a few weeks as soon as my VW contract is up and may go with Ting which as another reasonable cost provider.",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01GINVN1W,Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 32 GB…,        338 of 381 people found the following review helpful       Overheats VERY Quickly  July 15  2016By Taylor,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"So I did a lot of research before pre-ordering the Moto G 4th Generation. Many reviewers felt it to be an outstanding mid-range device but one or two did mention overheating issues due to the phone's Snapdragon 617 chipset. Swayed by the ""best budget phone ever made"" reviews and the amazing(!) deal on Amazon I decided to take a chance.I received the phone on its release day July 12. My first thought upon opening the box was ""It's beautiful!"" I loved the size display expandable memory etc. But almost right away the phone got VERY hot. Researching a little more I read that smartphones may get hot during the initial set up because of all the downloading and what not so I thought I'd keep tabs on the issue over the next few days.I noticed that the phone kept getting hot with just a few minutes of doing anything even just browsing the internet so yesterday I decided to install an app that would help detect overheating. This morning after about 10 minutes of playing Soda Crush the phone registered 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. After letting the phone cool down for half-an-hour I used the phone to read some news stories online. The phone then registered 105.2 degrees. The ambient temperature was 78 degrees.The ""solution"" posted on the Moto/Lenovo forums is hardly helpful [...] as I'm not in the middle of heatwave. I'm not using the phone with a case and none of the other situations apply.Aside from the heat issue the phone is fine. The overheating hasn't caused any performance problems as far as I can tell. I don't know if I got a dud. A search of the Amazon reviews for ""heat"" or ""hot"" came back with only 8-10 results. I'm debating whether or not I should return or exchange the Moto g. I'm torn because I like the phone otherwise and would rather not pay more than double or triple for a different phone. :(",1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01GINVN1W,Moto G (4th Generation) - Black - 32 GB…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Best $200 Phone  September 13  2016By Jose R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Lets start this review with what you are getting for the money. First off you are getting a 1.5 gHz octacore processor with a decent gpu (adreno 405) a 5.5 FHD (1080x1920-401ppi) display that gets plenty bright in the daylight sun 2 GB of RAM 16 GB of internal storage a 3000 mAh battery quick charge or as Motorola calls it turbo charge a 13 MP camera with dual tone LED flash a front facing camera with 5 MP and a clean uninterrupted build of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow.So now that we got the specs out of the way lets go ahead and get to what really matters; real life usage. So I bought this phone because I needed a quick replacement. I was rocking a BLU Life One X and it was a good phone with terrible manufacturer software support. So I go rid of it. I then was using an LG K7 that was nothing more than a backup phone for a short while until I got a new one. I am a broke college student so I wanted to make sure I spent my money wisely. I read reviews on this device saying that it doesn't have a premium build it doesn't the most features and it doesn't have this and it doesn't have that. Well when it comes down to it this phone works great. The overall usage of this device is quite strenuous. I watch an ungodly amount of YouTube on my free time I play this game where you walk around and find mythical animals and pretend to catch them (ahem) and I also use this phone pretty heavily for texting email video chat and phone calls. I may be a broke college student but I am one who is busy and needs a solid phone when my laptop is not accessible. This device breezes through the basics and the more demanding things with no hiccup. I attribute this to a couple of things. First off in the decent processor. In reviews you will hear that the Snapdragon 617 is underpowered and that it just lags terribly often. I have not found this to be the case. I haven't experienced any noticeable lag or stutter. I also attribute the smooth performance to Moto's software choice. They didn't add a bunch of extra features or gimmicks. They simply gave us stock Android with some basic additions that should be on every phone such as chop twice for flashlight and twist the wrist twice for camera. That is why this phone works so flawlessly. Now lets talk about battery life. The first day I got this device I was not satisfied with the battery performance because it seemed to drain very fast. Now that I have had the phone for about a 1 and half to 2 weeks the battery life has managed to last from about 8:30 in the morning to about 11:30 at night with about 30% battery left. I consider this very good because I am relatively heavy user. Even if you do use more battery than me Moto supplies a turbo charger in the box which charges my phone from about 15% to 75%-80% in about 30 minutes or less. In other words battery life is not an issue. When it comes to the display I found it to be more on the warm side which I like because the colors look very true to life. It's not groundbreaking but it is beautiful. Camera performance has also been very good. While it won't be knocking the Galaxy S7 off the top anytime soon this is the best camera in the $200 price range. In good light pictures look very very good and sharp with more than enough detail. Don't expect amazing low light pictures though for sub $200. Front facing camera does what it is supposed to do and will take good selfies for those narcissistic people in your family. The speaker on this device is also surprisingly good. It is a single firing front facing loud speaker that gets plenty loud and has very clear and rich sound. If Moto could have added one more on the bottom since there is not fingerprint scanner this would just be the icing on the cake. Now for the price point and the market I understand why people don't like the build of this phone. It used to be that you needed to spend upwards of $600 in order to get a premium metal body or a ""glass sandwich"". You no longer need to however. However I find this device to well out perform other phones at this price range. And in any case the build on this device is solid. It may be all plastic but I think that this phone can take quite a few drops. It also feels very good in the hand.So what is my final verdict. I think that this device is the best $200 dollar phone that money can buy. I also think this is the longest lasting phone that money can buy in this price range for one simple reason....updates. All of these other $200 phones may be slightly more feature rich to start but when this phone gets updated to 7.0 Nougat the others will be in the dust. It is a simple phone that does a lot of things well.",0

Then it developed a “ghost touch” like an unseen person was randomly operating the screen. During these more increasingly frequent events I cannot gain control of the device or even turn it off. Amazon doesn’t want the device back after 30 days and Lenovo the maker of the device tells you to try this and if that doesn’t work try this and if that doesn’t resolve the problem  try this other thing and if that doesn’t work well go back to the first suggestion.Pros: It hasn’t exploded.Cons: Can’t be used as a cell phone or tabletI have not be paid or accepted any merchandise by Amazon or its suppliers for this review.,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B00NQGP42Y,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Looking for a solution  February 6  2017By Valeria Martino,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought this phone on January 2 It arrived 3-4 weeks later (as everything I order from amazon I am in Honduras). As I received it the headphone jack was not working when I plugged in the headphones the sound was very bad quality I am not even able to enjoy a song (which is really important to me) but the sound that comes out of the iphone is good quality just not able to listen through the headphone jack. The phone has always been in a lifeproof phone case it has never been drop I have not submerged into water and it is new. I was going to let go of the sound problem even though I was dissappointed; but on saturday the touch started giving me problems. Yesterday (sunday) I was not able to use my phone at all  even though I restarted the phone several times to see if that would help but it did not; even if it did work it would not last for more than 15 seconds. I left the phone alone for the rest of the day and today I turned it on the touch works when it wants to (and if it does it just last for some minutes if lucky) and stops whenever it decides. Right now I am not beeing able to use it.I got to the conclusion that the phone came with failures and maybe it is just  my bad luck and the rest of the phones came out good but I really would like to know if there is something I could do about it because honestly I do really need it and in this condition it is just a waste of money. Please contact me if you think I could send the phone back and get another that works properly.Thanks and bye!,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B00NQGP42Y,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Got a Repaired Phone instead  December 29  2016By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The advertiser stated that the condition is good and the phone is used. I just want the seller to know that there is a sane difference in refurbished and repaired. What I got was a phone with replaced/ repaired screen and even that screen was not an original iPhone screen. Just for all you guys out there the way to identify whether the screen is repaired or original; (a) When you put some pressure on original screen you won't see any fade of colors while you will see colors heavily fading from the pressured area on the screen. That's third party low grade screen for iphones and are not of good quality at all. (b) You'll always find a thin gap on the sides of the screen and phone accidental exposure to water from the sides can immediately damage the phone. However when Apple replaces a screen its replaced via machines so there is no gap at all.How can you sell something like that? Selling cheap without letting others know what it could be is simply fooling others and by the way it wasn't cheap enough to match what you actually sold. Attached are the two images to show the gap.,1

They WILL NOT WORK with CDMA carriers like Sprint Verizon and the likes.  However...I just got the package and the phone has a ""Carrier VERIZON Model IPhone 6 sticker on the back!  So....what exactly did I get?  Have to wait and see...I emailed the seller (DealFisher) and am trying to research the MEID and IMEI.  The model number for both is 1549 so that's not much help.Update:  Apple says it's unlocked and not identified as lost/stolen or anything bad like that.  DealFisher says it's unlocked too.  Jury is still out on issues with Straight Talk and Verizon and traveling but phone seems to work and is in great shape battery seems to be holding and seller responded and is willing to work with me if there are issues...updated to 4 stars.",0

February 14  2017By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My night started out with pure enthusiasm as I found out my iPhone arrived. Soon that enthusiasm would go away.The first problem with the phone started out small but rather annoying the mute button was defective. I would mearly breath on the phone if even that and it would start toggling between mute and sound all while buzzing. Annoying.Then I found out that the model of iPhone was originally from either Korea or Japan making it so that I could not turn off the shutter sound when taking photos/snapshots highly annoying.I looked through the packaging to find out there was a 90 day warranty and I just had to call/email to get ahold of the company to fix the issue. Simple and helpful right? It would be if the company actually picked up the call or emailed you back. What a joke.I found out there are a couple work around a to these issues and I wasn't happy doing them but I didn't want to be without a phone even for a couple days (why I paid for this one to be over nighted to my dorm room even though it ended up not able to be in my hands until two days after I was supposed to.) so I was going to keep it.Then it died at 40 some percent battery and now I'm going to just return it and never deal with magic mobile partners again. Ever. I would advise you and anyone else who asked me to do the same. Just when I thought I was going to actually like iPhones probably will just buy a new one as I would suggest you do too if you want one.,0

SERIOUSLY?The second best option to get this solved was to contact the manufacturer which I did and they told me this is considered HAZMAT material and shouldn't be touched and of course the advised against shipping it back.

July 6  2016By Mary H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I needed a phone and quick.  I dropped my iPhone 5 and shattered the screen.  I did the usual amount of research for a new phone here on Amazon.  This place looked pretty good and it was very straightforward in its description that it's really just the phone and a power cord in a box when it's delivered.  The phone works great and was a breeze to set up (which doesn't really have much to do with the seller or the product but just nice to know).  The only reason this is a 4 star review is because I think they replaced the screen with an aftermarket screen that wasn't the best quality.  All along the bottom of the LCD display there is a strange physical line.  It's not a line produced from the LCD lighting or not lighting up but what looks like a glue line.  I can live with it no problem but it's there.  Other than that the purchase has been a good one.  I hope I don't need to purchase from them again (because I'm trying to be less clumsy and I won't drop this phone) but if I needed a new phone I'd look into this seller again.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B00YD53YQU,Apple iPhone 5S 16GB Silver GSM Unlocked…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Useless after only 7 months  proceed with caution  October 11  2016By OverCsShopper,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this refurbished phone on Amazon and began using it in March of 2016. It's now October 2016 and it's virtually useless. Two things were immediately wrong with the phone. First the back was significantly scratched up and did not appear new as promised. It was just cosmetic and I was going to use a case so I didn't freak out. It is after all a refurbished phone. Also since receiving the phone I have never been able to use it while it's plugged in. I didn't discover this until I already had it outside of the US so I decided it wasn't worth the effort of getting it back to the US to exchange it. Now it makes me wonder if that was the first sign of the problems that I am now having. About a week ago the phone started randomly turning off and saying that it had a low battery in the middle of the day (it had previously lasted all day easily). I would plug it in and when it turned back on it would say it was 40% charged still. This has gotten progressively worse each day until yesterday it began turning off after less than an hour while being 100% charged. I have tried restoring it along with various other suggestions on the internet but it's not a software problem. When I removed the OtterBox that I'd been using I discovered that the screen is coming off leading me to conclude that the battery is swelling (which would cause both the screen to detach and the phone to act as previously described). I have talked to the Authorized Apple repair technicians here in the country where I live but they won't touch it if it's believed to be a swollen battery. They say that opening it will likely mean they couldn't close it again it could cause someone harm and that replacing the battery here costs 80% of the cost of a new phone anyway. Because it's refurbished and beyond the 90 days of guarantee I have no recourse with Apple or the seller here. So after only 7 months I have a very expensive paperweight. Proceed with caution.,0

I had to accept whatever came on the box. Fortunately I was wrong.. The product came in perfect condition and brand new of course no problems with packaging or shipping. And after first hands on the phone you won't believe you pay 60 bucks (after taxes and handling) for this phone.. I MEAN IT! This guys  (BLU Inc. ) are doing an awesome job with budget phones. This phone is really awesome. Of course it doesn't look fancy or premium because it's obviously plastic but you fell like you have a 500$ phone in your hands..So if you are looking for a budget phone DO NOT hesitate of this one.. you won't be sorry!!",0

My first impression was that it was a Chinese brand so I noticed it on the Microsoft Store and contacted Microsoft nearly shaming them on the phone for selling this new brand I had not heard about.I then contacted Blu in Florida and in talking to them I learned that they are a USA company manufacturing in Brazil and other locations with Asian custom made parts. Ok it's worth a try.Impressed with features pricing and Customer Service.Now regarding this BLU Studio X8 HD it's camera is very very good the weight is very very good. Pricing you can't beat it for a dual sim phone Octa processor that's very fast and the HD features are also very much welcomed. Plenty of Battery capacity for this phone and works well in all regards.Summary: I will be buying more of these.Normally I buy iphones Samsung Motorola Kyocera Google Phones and others. Blu rates with the others mentioned here they all have advantages and some disadvantages we can all live with or without.,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MYRABC3,Huawei Mate 9 with Leica Dual Camera - 64GB…,        132 of 140 people found the following review helpful       Huawei Mate 9 is the best phone I have ever had  January 17  2017By PlantKiller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been in the cell phone industry for much of my career. I worked for Motorola and was one of the first to get my hands on the newest cell phones in the 90’s. Startacs Razors you name it. I have had my share of Motorola smart phones which I loved at the time and Samsungs. Though I have ‘allowed’ my wife to have an Apple I could never bring myself to over pay for one myself as I am deeply rooted in the Android eco-system.When I finally got my hands on a Nexus 6P (from Huawei) I thought all my prayers were answered but along comes the Mate 9. Faster better battery life and BIGGER. I have come to the conclusion that bigger is better and the Mate 9 is bigger (battery screen faster more beautiful) in every way. I even love the EMUI interface which surprised me Huawei has really listened to its customers and create a wonderful product.Let’s look at the most important features:The battery – When the 6P came out and it’s a great phone many reported it would last all day but not like the Mate 9. It really does.The finger print reader – Never again am I fumbling to get to my phone fast and accurate as they come.The camera – This is awesome my son is a profession photographer and he loves all the features I can barely understand and the beauty mode makes even an old guy like me look good.The performance – Bar none the best I have ever had. I never wait and everything is so smooth.Connectivity – Again I have had nothing like this. The Mate 9 seamlessly switched you back and forth to the best connection and automatically reconnects to WIFI for an exceptional experience. Until you have experienced WIFI+ you are missing the best speed you can get! Add to that more cellular bands and better coverage than ever.Dual sim cards for you business guys such a cool feature.Storage – Comes with a lot but it actually has a SD card slot imagine that Apple and Pixel.So if there is a con to this phone what would it be? Most likely the fact you don’t have one! Maybe you should get one and figure that out for yourself I bet it will be hard to find.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MYRABC3,Huawei Mate 9 with Leica Dual Camera - 64GB…,        92 of 99 people found the following review helpful       Great phone so far for an even better price!  January 6  2017By Mark S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just received this phone today and switched from Verizon to AT&T to get it to work. I had no issues with SIM cards or setup. I will give a quick impression now and then update later after I've spent some time with it. Out of the box externally it looks beautiful. I love the metal back and the dark color. The screen is huge with very small bezels. I'm used to 2k screens but the 1080 on this phone looks so crisp I barely notice the difference. The software seems pretty well optimized. I was able to switch launchers easily. I had some issues with their backup software so I just manually did everything through google. Very little lag and everything opens immediately. The camera is very fun to use and has a lot of features to play with.*Weekend Update*After spending the weekend with the phone I am still very happy with my purchase.The battery life is great compared to my old phone. I play Clash Royale and check it frequently for texting and social media and snapchat and I can easily get through the day without having to charge it. There is very little drain while the phone is idle also which is nice. As long as you don't leave a ton of apps open constantly. They have a function that alerts you to background processes using up heavy battery but it can get a little frustrating with Facebook and Spotify. Those two apps will constantly restart themselves in the background to refresh info so I'd say once every hour or so I get a warning alerting me to close background apps that aren't physically running on the phone. The app itself is killed there is just a process running.  Would be nice to be able to permanently lock the Facebook app from reopening itself but I don't so much blame the phone for that as I do Facebook developers.Performance is still great. With past phones they tend to heat up when using games even right out of the box but the Mate can handle everything I threw at it with no lag. I tested Clash Royale the new Roller Coaster Tycoon port and Non-stop Knight. No problems across the board.I noticed  the notifications do not appear on your lock screen by default like not even an icon saying you have a notification. You have to go into each app in the settings individually and select which appear on the lock screen. Otherwise without unlocking it you have no way of knowing you have a message besides the LED. So it can be fixed you just have to take the time to do it. Speaking of unlocking the phone the fingerprint reader is phenomenal. I've never used a backside reader before so I figured it would be weird getting used to but this fingerprint reader is so quick it to me no time at all to adjust. You don't have to click to turn the screen on at all you just tap your finger on the reader quick with the screen completely black and it will unlock to your home screen instantly. Also there is feature that you can swipe on the reader to scroll through pictures or to bring down the settings screen which I think is pretty cool. Finally you can double click the volume down button to instantly take a picture from the lock screen. Again this happens almost immediately it's one of my favorite features so far.I changed my rating to 5 stars for now because I do love the time I've spent with the phone. I'll probably update again after about a month and definitely after they push the Alexa update that is supposed to be coming. Until then enjoy if you decide to buy! It's a great deal!,0

Obviously some are better than others. I have to say that I have become sort of an experienced Android phone purchaser. I have purchased Android phones from low range to mid range to top of the line . I am so impressed with my Huawei Mate 9. It is absolutely a top notch high range Android phone with a mid range price. Not too much bloatware (very little) super responsive I have not run into any glitches whatsoever. Did I mention that the finger print scanner is super precise. I love this phone no hype. It's a great phone at a great price.,0

I'm more of a ""casual"" user and keep phones for 2+ years.  I mostly email text surf make calls check weather use maps use Google apps take pics and occasionally play a game.  The Mate 9 has aligned with all my expectations (thus far) having never been a Huawei customer.  I Iove the fingerprint scanner love the screen (especially how bright it can get outside) love the 2-3 days I can get between battery charges (YMMV) love the feel in hand love the camera love the 64 gb storage and storage upgrade with memory card option love the call clarity/loudness (speakerphone included) and love the reception (more ATT bars at my house & work than previous Moto X 2014 Pure Edition).  I also like EMUI coming from the Moto X Pure.  I'm hoping for a car charger from Huawei in the near future.  Overall it seems this phone will do me fine for the next 2+ years.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B00F3J4B5S,Apple iPhone 5s GSM Unlocked Cellphone…,        12 of 12 people found the following review helpful       Tips for Buying a used iPhone 5s  October 16  2016By ruel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Purchased a very nice used AT&T Unlocked iPhone 5s 64GB Gold/White from here on amazon. Have bought a dozen or so iphones from here on amazon for myself and for family -- and can tell you some things to watch out for when ordering a used iphone.Got this used iPhone 5s for a little under two hundred dollars from amazon marketplace seller Mobile Legacy. The iphone was described as ""USED - VERY GOOD"" with a short seller's description that said the iphone was in ""excellent condition"" with ""minor blemishes"". Since the seller's listing was somewhat general you do have to read between the lines and hope for the best as to what you're getting -- because you really won't know what is the real condition of the iphone until you actually get the iphone into your own hands.Anyways Two Hundred Bucks was a great price for a used 64-GigaByte version of an unlocked iPhone 5s. Was upgrading from an iPhone 5 and wanted an iphone that was more powerful and with more storage space. And was willing to settle for this iPhone 5s with the 64GB at this price -- meaning wanted to get it right now at this price -- instead of waiting to save more money to get a new iPhone SE with the same amount of 64GB storage.However since this iPhone 5s was a used iphone had to brace myself for possible unfortunate flaws which could be included in a used iPhone 5s particularly the following two possibilities: (1) there could be dings on the metal frame; and/or (2) there could be a broken screen replacement that doesn't re-use the original home touch-id button.There were definitely a few dings on the side edges of the metal frame of this iphone -- including three very small gashes. Most of the not-too-many dings could be sanded filed and polished to look better. But the three obvious gashes took out very tiny chucks of the frame. They weren't super bad but they were definitely flaws that could use a little filling with a tiny bit of bondo or metallic paint to fill in the gashes. Yeah this iphone was definitely dropped. But overall the metal frame was still in really very good condition and these cosmetic flaws could be labeled as ""minor blemishes"".And since this iphone was apparently dropped the screen was most likely replaced. Although the screen that came with this iphone was clean and flawless in appearance with no hairline scratches at all you can usually expect AT LEAST some very minor almost hard-to-detect tiny hairline scratches on a used iphone's screen. My guess is that the original screen broke when this iphone was dropped. The dings on the edges of the iphone's metal frame do indicate the iphone was definitely dropped.What further told me that the screen was most likely replaced was that the Home Button's Touch ID did not work. My guess is whoever did the screen replacement that person was not careful enough to re-use the original Home Button with its cable from the old broken screen. On the iPhone 5s the home button's touch id sensor is paired with the iphone's logic board chips. The basic function of the Home Button will work meaning you can press it and manually use your passcode to get into the iphone but the Touch ID function will no longer be available because the pairing was wrong. Only Apple can reprogram the touch id pairing connection to the iphone. Too bad. Without the Touch ID the iPhone 5s is just a much more powerful and faster version of the older iPhone 5.This iPhone 5s otherwise worked great -- despite no touch id. Cosmetically the ""minor blemishes"" could be filed/polished/sanded a little bit and/or covered with a nice bumper or case. The back had only a minor scratch that was mostly dirt that could be removed.So added a nice metal aluminum bumper and put tempered glass protectors onto both the front screen and the back of the iphone and this iphone looked great IMHO.The only other significant issue to watch out for when getting a used iphone is the battery. This iphone's battery had over 500 load cycles on it. And the iphone was running a bit warm. The battery definitely needed to be changed. Highly recommend that you watch a bunch of youtube videos if you want to change the battery yourself. It's relatively easy to do but there are a few tricky items to note when opening up the iPhone 5s and replacing the battery.So if you are buying a used iPhone 5s be aware that you may have to balance a trade off between paying a great price versus getting an iphone with a few flaws which may only be generally (vaguely) described in an amazon marketplace seller's very short description.",0

(My Fault)So I figure let's order from them again and get the 64 GB since I loved my old phone so much and for about a day and a half everything was just peachy couldn't be happier.Then this morning it decides ""Hey! I want to die right.....Now!"" and the whole screen won't slide anymore. I can't even turn it off or even slide to unlock. Still turns on (Thank god for Touch I.D.) oddly Assist touch works all the physical buttons even the headphones too. Leaving me completely confused.The screen isn't damaged or even looks out of the ordinary but I can't slide nor select any apps.The only positive note is when it died I was on my Kygo playlist so I got that going for me which is nice.TL:DRPhone was perfect for about 36 hours then the screen won't respond to almost anything luckily It still plays great tunesEdit My badIt came back to life after I bled out the batteryJust a tech scare is all",0

Next the 326ppi pixel density is what Apple calls a Retina display. This means that when you view the screen at a normal distance you can't view individual pixels. In other words everything looks pin-sharp and more resolution wouldn't achieve anything bar making icons and text too small to read without scaling.Image quality is excellent too. Apple has used a high-quality IPS panel and it's still one of the best smartphone displays. It's evenly lit bright produces excellent whites and vibrant colours and the excellent viewing angles mean that you can see what's on screen clearly from anywhere.,0

They WILL NOT WORK with CDMA carriers like Sprint Verizon and the likes.  However...I just got the package and the phone has a ""Carrier VERIZON Model IPhone 6 sticker on the back!

February 14  2017By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My night started out with pure enthusiasm as I found out my iPhone arrived. Soon that enthusiasm would go away.The first problem with the phone started out small but rather annoying the mute button was defective. I would mearly breath on the phone if even that and it would start toggling between mute and sound all while buzzing. Annoying.Then I found out that the model of iPhone was originally from either Korea or Japan making it so that I could not turn off the shutter sound when taking photos/snapshots highly annoying.I looked through the packaging to find out there was a 90 day warranty and I just had to call/email to get ahold of the company to fix the issue. Simple and helpful right? It would be if the company actually picked up the call or emailed you back. What a joke.I found out there are a couple work around a to these issues and I wasn't happy doing them but I didn't want to be without a phone even for a couple days (why I paid for this one to be over nighted to my dorm room even though it ended up not able to be in my hands until two days after I was supposed to.) so I was going to keep it.Then it died at 40 some percent battery and now I'm going to just return it and never deal with magic mobile partners again. Ever. I would advise you and anyone else who asked me to do the same. Just when I thought I was going to actually like iPhones probably will just buy a new one as I would suggest you do too if you want one.,0

I don't mean ""incredible for the price"" which then implies that if you spend more money you'll automatically get a better device. I mean incredible full stop. I have only purchased ""high-end"" devices in the past I've tried iPhones expensive androids and even a Windows phone that was quickly replaced (there's just no app support on Windows). I currently own a Sony Xperia Z5 that I paid nearly $600 for. This $200 phone performs better than that so called ""high end"" device. Money does not matter anymore it's getting cheaper to make full-featured phones. Specs matter the hardware matters and the value that you're getting matters. Anyway here's my review:The battery life on this device is impressive. It's not an exaggeration to say that you can get a few days of heavy use between charges. The display is large pin sharp bright and beautiful. Colors are rendered very well on this device.I have absolutely no complaints about the camera and in fact I think it has a few features that should be standard on more devices. The sensor is actually a Sony sensor which may explain why I love the camera so much I'm a longtime fan of the Xperia line. There is a professional mode that allows you to manually focus your shots in addition to controlling the shutter speed iso and white balance. That's pretty cool and there are not a lot of phones that will allow that. The slow motion video is a little choppy but usable it's no worse than the slow motion on my aforementioned Sony phone. The time-lapse video feature is crazy useful the time-lapse camera has always been my favorite Xperia app so I was excited to see it on this device. There are a few more gimmicky camera modes like mood shot (a polaroid maker with quick filters) and gif mode that are fun to play around with. The low light performance  in auto mode isn't anything to write home about BUT the night shot mode does a great job so if you're in low light just switch to that and you'll be good to go. I added a photo of pumpkins that I took in night mode the only light sources were the tea-light candles inside the pumpkins. There's one more camera mode that I loved mega-pixel or perfect-pixel or something that takes a photograph 300 times the size of a regular shot. This is useful for zooming in you can crop into the larger image instead and retain the image quality.This phone has both a rear and front-facing flash yet another feature my $600 phone does not have. The rear-facing speaker is my biggest sticking point with this phone it detracts from the clean design of the back of the phone and of course makes listening to audio without headphones or an external speaker more challenging but I don't care very much about the built in speakers on my phones so it's not a major concern. The fingerprint scanner is great. I love the placement and I love that it's just a scanner and not a button. The phone looks expensive and feels nice in the hand. It's very lightweight.I would definitely recommend purchasing this device I don't regret the money I spent on phones in the past because cheap phones used to be...well..cheap but moving forward I will be buying more phones from Blu.",1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCRY,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        12 of 12 people found the following review helpful       This phone is a tank!!!  January 30  2017By Anthony S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So first off I'm hard on my phone's absolutely horrible to them. I originally owned a Blu studio 5.0 and it was trash to say the least but hey review is not about that it's about the Vivo 5R. So first impression it's quite large however it's similar in size to the Moto X and LG Optimus G pro speaking from experience as I owned these before the Vivo as well. Competing with these is not difficult for the Vivo 5R I feel the clock speed for the processor may be underrated due to the fact that it is faster next to it's flagship cousins (dare I say cousins). The RAM is perfect for moderate to heavy usage I have yet to see the phone link or slow from large apps running. Next the screen it is a tad sharper than the Moto and a yard more colorful than the LG. Battery life one word astonishing. I stream music from YouTube while I'm at work unhealthy for the data but on low brightness I can easily get 10 hours of constant YouTube before I need to consider a charger. Storage 32gb as well as an SD card forget Apple. And last but not least strength and durability. This phone has surpassed my expectations. The following is not exaggerated this phone has been thrown dropped kick slid and stepped on. It has landed on carpet asphalt concrete gravel snow and slush. It has gotten water splashed on it and slush and snow in the charging and headphone ports everything is still working perfectly. But there is only one reason I am buying another one. On this day I am writing a review to state that this phone is indeed a tank earlier I accidentally shut the phone in my car door hard to explain but it was an accident. The phone came out functioning with no problem the frame and screen are bent the glass DID NOT crack the bend runs under the fingerprint scanner and it still works. I am writing this review on the phone itself. So all in all well worth the $200 if not more especially considering the only reason I'm buying another is I don't want to work with a bent phone so other than the before mentioned asthetic issue it's a perfect phone for the fast paced but rough user!,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCRY,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        14 of 15 people found the following review helpful       A few things corrected and this would have been a 'love it' phone  November 10  2016By DevB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have had the BLU VIVO 5R for a month now. I wanted to use it for some time before I penned my review in an attempt to make it as objective as possible.Ok to start off: It is a nice big phone pretty sleek and with a passable finish. A few people have asked me ""which phone?"" the answer has mostly left them with a ""?"" on their face. So clearly BLU is not a very popular phone in the US market.Personally I went for BLU coz the specs looked impressive on paper; and I did not want to spend a lot for similar specs from a flagship manufacturer. My honest view is that its a OK phone I can't really say i LOVE it and nor can I say I HATE it. Although the thought of returning it did cross my mind.Most important difference for any Samsung users the badge notifications for any new WhatsApp or SMS or missed calls - this feature is absent. As I learnt it after researching this was a Samsung feature that they apparently copied from Apple. But I have failed to reason why Android does not have this feature built-in. There are a number of skins that claim to enable this functionality but I was unable to get any of the skins working. I have now just surrendered - and am being forced to getting used to seeing these notifications only in the notifications bar.The auto brightness control/feature while present is questionable. I have often felt that the default brightness that it auto-adjusts is often lower than ideal required - thus requiring you to manually tweak it often.The camera: while the pictures look better than some of the other models the pictures don't seem to have the sharp edges when we zoom in. So camera is OK but not really as good as the promise. One serious drawback the moment you attempt to start the camera app say when the battery is 15-18% it just flashes a warning that battery is low and camera cannot be operated and the phone just shuts down! Totally weird! A phone with 3000mah battery switches off at 15% and prevents camera usage!The battery: I use my phone a lot for calls and then some for whats app and text messages. The battery is good not great; but will run a day. The only issue however I felt is that it takes forever to charge the battery.Fingerprint sensor: It is nice and I think this is the only feature that this model had which I was tempted to go for. Another smart feature is that it give multiple options to unlock the phone. viz. if you are at home or face recognizition or few others.Call quality: It is ok though I noticed I often need to keep the volume to max. Also weird thing when I am on call the phone locks after the usual 30 or 45 secs inactivity and then when I have to conference or use any other feature. I first need to go to home screen; unlock with my finger and then get back to phone app and then try conferencing. This just adds a 5 - 10 second delay - which irritates me a bit.It has got 3 GB RAM plus oct core. So speed of operation is not an issue.All in all its a good buy if your expectations are average+ and you have a tight budget. But if you can live with above shortcomings its probably a very good phone for you.",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCRY,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        33 of 37 people found the following review helpful       Great Phone That Needs Android Updates  December 1  2016By TJP,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Update1/31/17Blu allowed an ""update"" through its wireless update app that has put malware on my phone. I can't remove and Blu is not providing assistance.  Don't buy their phones they don't have the infrastructure like Apple and Samsung that is needed to update the OS and keep our info safe.11/2016 Love this phone everyone who sees it oohs and aahs. When they see see ""BLU"" on the back of the phone they are thoroughly confused.  I am one of the early converts to cutting cords and contracts for cable and phone and anything else. This phone is high high quality and the price is not cheap it is simply how much a phone is supposed to cost. Especially when you know technology changes and you will scratch your tech itch in another 2 years. Their phones come with everything you need including a screen protector and a phone cover that will not hide the cool sealed metal handset. The fingerprint recognition is much better than my Samsung Galaxy ever was. It's not buggy takes good pictures smoothly plays videos call volume and call quality is excellent. Thanks to Google seamless transition of apps and contacts.Cons- That being said I have played with it for a month and there are 3 issues. I have downloaded security software to monitor my web activity. When I set this as a default action in settings (hard to locate too) the system will ignore what I have done and turn off my changes. 2nd issue I use cast at times to show websites on my TV through Roku. This option at times simply does not work.  This being said the cause could be because it uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as an operating system. While other providers have updated patches BLU has not. I have no idea if my phone will even contemplate upgrading to 7.0 Nougat. The lack of updates could be a major no go for some consumers. Also I hate the ugly finger shaped emoji and wish I didn't have to download an ad riddled app for more choices.",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCRY,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       A good phone  but certainly not 5 stars.  December 27  2016By Oliver Gampe,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Note: I used the phone for about 6 weeks.1) Why did I order the phone?  My Nexus 5X ended up with a cracked screen and I was torn between having it fixed for $100 at the mall or getting a new cheap phone to last me until the Pixels get some rebates.I was not totally happy with the 5X (the 2GB of RAM just killed the package) so I ended up looking at phones around the $200 and there were not too many that I felt torn between. It came down to the Vivo 5R and an Asus one. What swayed me towards the Vivo was the location of the fingerprint reader (just like on the 5X) the described battery life and the gist of the reviews mostly. It just felt like this would require not too much change in my habits of using the phone.2) Initial impression  My initial impression was highly positive (that would have been 5 stars for sure). The phone looked and felt nice it came with a bumper case an applied screen protector and headphones (which I haven't tried) and I was quite happy. I couldn't restore my settings/apps from my 5X due to the Vivo running on Marshmallow but it didn't take me long to get everything set up. So in short great job Blu!3) Getting used to it  From the start I was amazed by the battery - this phone really lasts a day even with heavy use. I've used it as a hotspot for a full working day did calls messages email during that time and it was not empty at night. Or on another measure more than 4.5 hrs of Pokemon go (about twice as long as on the 5X). The fingerprint reader works great fast and precise and the screen is crisp and bright. Great! Also the 3GB of RAM mean that even though the CPU is not the fastest apps seem faster than in the 5X because they don't have to be loaded from scratch almost every time. Quite a nice phone up to this point.But then I got to the first thing that I wasn't so happy with: the camera. Coming from the 5X and having used that phone's camera exclusively on vacations and gotten great pictures I was expecting a downgrade but not as much of one as I received. The camera is pretty bad not really good for anything beyond the occasional snapshot where you don't care about the quality. In anything but the brightest light the pictures are always fuzzy oddly enough usually looking much better on the screen when you take them than in the actual picture that's saved. That's the first star that's coming off my rating. I didn't expect a top-of-the-line camera but one that would have been good 3 or 4 years ago... Another thing you have to get used to is seeing the software status of... well whenever they chose to last update it. It was ""June 2016"" a couple of weeks ago. Given how frequently Android receives updates you really have to decide if you're happy with a phone that's half a year behind the guys trying to take over your device. I understand that that's one of the reasons the phone is so cheap but it's an issue that's slightly bothersome. So that's the next star that comes off.4) And service?  Service is as can be expected I think. My phone started continuously booting after 6 weeks and after a short email exchange with Blu support I got an RMA # and my phone is now on the way to their Florida office. It's a bring-in warranty and that's fine. I'm expecting it to be gone for at least 4 weeks maybe 5 depending on how they ship it back.In short: It's a good phone for $200 if you don't need the camera much and stay away from fishy websites that are trying to plant malware on your device in short.The screen the battery and the performance will certainly not disappoint you if you're shopping in this price-range.(And yes I'm back on my 5X after I had the screen fixed at the mall and it does feel much slower than the Vivo thanks to the insufficient RAM)",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCRY,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        12 of 13 people found the following review helpful       Save yourself the headache...pass on this one  October 7  2016By Redhead,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is my 3rd BLU phone. The first 2 were the Studio Energy 2 and those phones were very sturdy as well as dependable. This phone not so much. This phone has issues and I will not go into all of them but I will say the main two that made me return mine. First off when making a call the phone would just reset back to DOS mode or Android mode. It would say Android needs a password to reboot. Five minutes later I would be able to dial the number. The second issue that tops my list the speaker was horrible. It would be louder for music but scratchy and then too low for the ringer and notifications. I see more people are having the speaker issue as well so back it goes. NO the plastic was not left on it. This is how they are trying to explain away the issue on other phones they sell as well. This way the potential buyer thinks Oh buyer mistake. This is not the case on most.Also no thanks to amazon for holding back my shipment. Took over a week for 2 day shipping. Zero stars to Amazon for that.,0

February 25  2016By Sebaot,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I got this phone on time and working as promised but after a month the LCD started coming off like something was pushing out from the inside and overnight the iPhone's LCD was pushed all the way out and the battery popped up like inflated and it seemed to be leaking some sort of acid.But this is not the main issue here the problem really started when I contacted Customer Service to find out they wanted me to pack the leaking acid phone and sent it back claiming the acid and the LCD sharp glass coming out of the phone are not a problem. SERIOUSLY?The second best option to get this solved was to contact the manufacturer which I did and they told me this is considered HAZMAT material and shouldn't be touched and of course the advised against shipping it back. Very Disappointing and I ended up with $300 dollar worth of hazardous Material.,1

July 6  2016By Mary H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I needed a phone and quick.  I dropped my iPhone 5 and shattered the screen.  I did the usual amount of research for a new phone here on Amazon.  This place looked pretty good and it was very straightforward in its description that it's really just the phone and a power cord in a box when it's delivered.  The phone works great and was a breeze to set up (which doesn't really have much to do with the seller or the product but just nice to know).  The only reason this is a 4 star review is because I think they replaced the screen with an aftermarket screen that wasn't the best quality.  All along the bottom of the LCD display there is a strange physical line.  It's not a line produced from the LCD lighting or not lighting up but what looks like a glue line.  I can live with it no problem but it's there.  Other than that the purchase has been a good one.  I hope I don't need to purchase from them again (because I'm trying to be less clumsy and I won't drop this phone) but if I needed a new phone I'd look into this seller again.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B00YD5400Y,Apple iPhone 5S 16GB GMS Unlocked Space…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Useless after only 7 months  proceed with caution  October 11  2016By OverCsShopper,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this refurbished phone on Amazon and began using it in March of 2016. It's now October 2016 and it's virtually useless. Two things were immediately wrong with the phone. First the back was significantly scratched up and did not appear new as promised. It was just cosmetic and I was going to use a case so I didn't freak out. It is after all a refurbished phone. Also since receiving the phone I have never been able to use it while it's plugged in. I didn't discover this until I already had it outside of the US so I decided it wasn't worth the effort of getting it back to the US to exchange it. Now it makes me wonder if that was the first sign of the problems that I am now having. About a week ago the phone started randomly turning off and saying that it had a low battery in the middle of the day (it had previously lasted all day easily). I would plug it in and when it turned back on it would say it was 40% charged still. This has gotten progressively worse each day until yesterday it began turning off after less than an hour while being 100% charged. I have tried restoring it along with various other suggestions on the internet but it's not a software problem. When I removed the OtterBox that I'd been using I discovered that the screen is coming off leading me to conclude that the battery is swelling (which would cause both the screen to detach and the phone to act as previously described). I have talked to the Authorized Apple repair technicians here in the country where I live but they won't touch it if it's believed to be a swollen battery. They say that opening it will likely mean they couldn't close it again it could cause someone harm and that replacing the battery here costs 80% of the cost of a new phone anyway. Because it's refurbished and beyond the 90 days of guarantee I have no recourse with Apple or the seller here. So after only 7 months I have a very expensive paperweight. Proceed with caution.,0

I read the reviews both positive and negative and decided for short term to just text call and email this phone would be OK.  It wasn't OK.  Not even close to OK.  In addition to all the other negatives from other reviews I will add that the antenna on this phone is REALLY REALLY weak.  I never could make a phone call because at best I had 1 bar and the call didn't go through.  I never managed to get a text through but I did get the email to work.  Unfortunately I could only send emails if I was sitting within 5 feet of the router.  Oh yeah there is the battery life.  There isn't any.  OK I'm exaggerating.  If you don't use it it has a day or two.  If you forget to turn off Wi Fi you've got a couple hours.,0

Phones from you.I got them about two months later due to delivery problems in my country Venezuela.After getting the  lines for them I started using them but one of the phone chargers didn't work to charge the phone battery at all so I have used the second phone charger to charge both phones batteries.I would like to know if you can change the phone charger and at the same time I would like to buy two extra phone chargers for these two 2 BLU Dash JR W D141w Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM... phones.About the phones performance:One of the phones lost the phone directory I wrote into its own memory. I have written it again.The second phone works properly but it isn't able to keep the date for a long time so I have to write it over again now and then.Out of these troubles they are working properly as expected.Thanks for your timeGustavo Pernía,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B00OJCOQPK,Blu Dash JR D141W Dual Sim Factory Unlocked…, Never could get it to work.  February 21  2017By Claudia L. EwingVerified Purchase(What's this?),1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Start out by saying I love my BLU phones that I have had.  They were the more expensive ones I liked the first one so much I replaced it with another one.  But this one bought for a back up phone while my husband was in the hospital  I never could get to work.  We took it to the AT&T store for a SIM card and activation with a new number and they tried and tried even calling their support team and it never would turn on/call/accept calls.  And yes it was charged.  Unfortunately due to my husband having surgery and then me having an accidental injury myself I missed the three week s\window for returning the phone.  Lesson learned.  So now I have a phone that doesn't work.  Don't waste your money.  Just go get a GO phone you will be much happier with it.,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        171 of 182 people found the following review helpful       Free from clutter  but not free from flaws (list of preinstalled apps at end)  September 1  2016By J. Maxon,4.0 out of 5 stars,,Update: On 1/27/17 Nextbit was acquired by Razer (the gaming hardware/software company). As of now they are saying that the Robin will have one more year of software updates and a 6-month hardware warranty. The Robin has been taken off sale in official channels (if you are buying this on Amazon it’s likely through a seller that has some in stock still) and the manufacturing of new models has ceased. As of this update (02/02/17) I have yet to see what the official word is on Razer continuing the 100GB of cloud storage. Seems like an unusual acquisition but hopefully Razer’s reputation will mean good things for the Nextbit line of phones (and won’t mean poor things for current owners of the Robin).-----------------------------Note even though this phone is unlocked it won’t work on Verizon Wireless or Sprint. There was a CDMA version in the works but it was canceled before launch. It does however work for LTE and HSPA bands such as T-Mobile and AT&T. Also this uses the smaller Nano SIM like the iPhone rather than the slightly larger Micro SIM that is found in many android phones. For instance I have both the Note 4 and LG G4 which use the micro SIM so I had to get a nano from my cellular provider. T-Mobile charges $20 for a new SIM but they gave it to me free because I’ve been a customer for 9-years. Since there are times that I switch between phones I also ordered a SIM adapter kit for a few bucks. The nice thing about owning the smaller nano SIM is that you can easily increase its size with an adapter to work on macro phones. That way I can still use the Note 4 and G4 when I want to.####### SETUP #######The phone came at about 50% battery life so I charged it before using. Setting up the Robin was pretty simple and easy. If you already own an android phone you can copy over your Google Accounts apps and data. You just need to have NFC turned on in your other device (for me it was my Note 4). Then hold the phones back to back. While this seemed to work for whatever reason the Robin was extremely slow at downloading and installing my apps. (Rather than transferring them from the old phone to the new it simply accesses the download location on the Google Play Store.) After waiting several hours I decided to do a factory reset on the Robin and just installed everything fresh. This worked more smoothly and wasn’t bogged down when downloading.####### DATA #######It picked up my T-Mobile data pretty well; was able to access email the app store and browser the internet. But I was getting errors when people sent me MMS messages which is basically texts that contain images video or audio. To fix this I had to go to Settings > More > Cellular network and then click on “Access Point Names.” From there I selected the T-Mobile US 260 entry which was defaulted to on then added T-mobile’s massively long URL which has mms.msg in the chain (Amazon won’t let me post links but you can google it) and then added “mms” to the list under  “APN type.” (eg. It now shows “defaultsuplmms”). After rebooting I was able to see media in texts. I don’t exactly know why this was necessary as there is an APN record called “T-Mobile MMS” on the list already but it wasn’t working.The good news is they didn’t leave out the tethering and portable hotspot feature. I use this when I’m out and about and want to either give data to my iPad Air or the phone I’m letting my daughter use that doesn’t have an active SIM. While there isn’t a shortcut for the Home screen to turn the hotspot off or on you can toggle it from the menu that appears when you drag down twice from the top of the screen.####### BUILD #######As far as the Robin’s marketing goes the cursing in the product video seemed a bit childish to me but I get they are trying to be trendy and hip and aim for a more modern crowd. Keeping that in mind I found it ironic that their original white/teal design looked a bit childish; more like a toy. Thankfully they offer a midnight version which [IMHO] appeals to a more mature taste. I was worried that the boxy design wouldn’t sit comfortably in my hand but because I have large hands that didn’t prove to be an issue for me. Granted -- since the Robin is so thin and not very wide -- I found it a bit awkward to hold in two hands when typing on. It will take some practice to get used to but I can see a case helping here by adding bulk. What I did find slightly uncomfortable about this design was the pointed corners when in my front pocket -- not that it poked me but I definitely felt a difference. I also find that the polycarbonate material makes the phone somewhat slippery. Since there’s no texture on the plastic surface to add friction I worry it will slip out of my grip and go crashing to the ground. I did notice that the more dry my hands were the more slippery the phone was. Ironically moisture seemed to add to the friction and increase grip. A good case can solve this problem altogether.####### STORAGE #######Even though the product video shows a phone falling in a toilet the Robin does not provide water resistance; in fact water or liquid damage is not covered under warranty. Nextbit is simply showing that their storage will back up the phone’s data should it get wet and destroyed. While there is no microSD expansion slot the Robin tries to make up for this by adding cloud storage. Of course cloud storage requires either a mobile data plan or a connected WiFi to work. Most users have data nowadays but not everyone (myself included) pays for an unlimited plan. As a T-Mobile user I technically have unlimited data but in all honesty it’s near worthless once the high-speed cap is reached. I tried downloading the Yahoo Sports app while past my limit and it gave me a 60-minute download time. Have unlimited high-speed data? That’s great but consider you may enter a dead zone that cuts you off.Not only that but WHAT you can backup is limited. Unlike a micro SD card where you can drop any files you like the cloud will only store app data and photos; videos and music and other files are not supported. This means those types of files will eat at your 32GB internal storage (which is really 24.5GB after accounting for the preinstalled apps and OS). Want to take a lot of HD videos? This might not be the best phone for you. That said I back up my photos and videos using Google Photos and as long as you don’t care about Google shrinking the size down a bit you can store an unlimited amount for free.By default the phone will only backup to the cloud when it is on WiFi and plugged in. You can also set it to do so over data and remove the charging restriction. Similarly you can tell it to only back up photos or to only back up application data (both are on by default). Things that get offloaded to the cloud will be grayed out when they're offline. Thankfully the cloud attempts to only back up less used apps and data so chances are this won’t be a huge issue. You can also pin an app to the phone that you want to have access to at all times that way it won’t get nabbed up by the cloud.I think the cloud storage is a good idea but I don’t see it as a true replacement to a good old micro SD card. Especially if for some reason the company goes under and they cancel their service. If Nextbit did it perfectly they’d have offered both as an option.####### HARDWARE #######While the Robin’s rivals are arguably the OnePlus 2 and Moto X Play one could compare some of its base hardware to the older flagships like the Samsung Note 4 and LG G4. For instance all three have 3GB of RAM and 32 GB of built-in storage. The Robin doesn’t quite hold up to the 16MP cameras of the Note 4 and G4 but it isn’t too far behind at 13MP. The front camera is 5MP which is lower than the G4’s 8MP but larger than the Note 4’s 3.7MP. Interestingly the Robin shares the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 hexa-core processor as the G4 but is slightly faster at 2 GHz vs. 1.8 GHz. The Robin matches the Note 4’s Gorilla Glass 4 while the G4 only uses Gorilla Glass 3. What I find the least competing is the 1080 x 1920 pixels with 424 ppi which is smaller than both the Note 4 and G4’s 1440 x 2560 pixels with 500+ ppi. It also falls short with a smaller 2680 mAh battery: the Note 4 has a 3220 mAh and G4 a 3000 mAh. If you are playing Pokemon Go as much as my daughter this will suck up real fast so I recommend a portable battery charger depending on how long you are away from a standard power source.One other thing that sets the Robin apart from the Note 4 and G4 is the absence of a removable battery. Personally I prefer a removable battery for a last-resort-hard-boot to swap with a fully charged battery or to replace down the road if the battery starts getting old and weak. Granted with the short shelf life of most cellphones this is becoming less of an issue.*** Fingerprint Scanner ***Like the Note 4 the Robin has a fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone. It looks and works differently however. With the Note 4 you have to slide your thumb across it while the Robin is a simple press. Because the Robin’s fingerprint scanner is on the upper right side it’s much easier to access. The Note 4 can get awkward at times with the button at the bottom and is somewhat difficult to do one handed. The Robin got this right and it works effectively. I stored both pointer fingers and my right thumb that way I can easily unlock the device regardless of what hand I’m holding it in or if it’s sitting in my car mount.*** Camera ***When the phone is in standby mode you can quickly activate the camera by double pressing the power button and if you double press it again it will take a photo. Granted the double press causes the camera to jiggle and thus more often than not a blurry picture results but you can also tap the screen to take the photo to avoid the extra movement. There is a bit of a delay when snapping a shot at times and it can take several seconds for the camera to fully load; which may be too late if you are trying to capture a moving object.*** Charging ***Oddly while there is a charging indicator light it only shows one color -- white -- and the light stays the same regardless of whether the phone is charged or being charged. Basically this means you can’t tell when it’s finished without pressing the power button and seeing the status on the screen. When the phone is turned off and plugged in the white light pulsates every three seconds. When the phone is turned on and plugged in the white light stays lit. Whether your battery is at 20% or 100% the light color and pattern stays the same. It would have been nice for it to at least blink or something when finished so I can tell from a distance. Also this is the first phone I’ve had that didn’t come with a wall charger which seems kinda cheap on their part. You’ll either need to use an existing one you own purchase one separately or plug the cable into a USB port on your computer. The good thing is that the Robin does support Quick Charge 2.0 but as mentioned you’ll need to purchase a quick charger separately.While it’s nice in one sense that the Robin uses a USB Type C plug -- a newer technology even faster than USB 3.0  -- I’d say 95% of my devices use Micro-USB. That means my existing cables won’t work. As far as chargers go the only charger I have an issue with is the one that has a built-in Micro-USB connector. Thankfully my other chargers use the standard USB plug (aka USB-A) so while the Robin uses USB Type C for the phone the other end of the provided cable can still plug into a standard USB-A port. Since Apple adopted the USB Type C technology hopefully this format will be around for a while and I won’t have to update all my cables yet again in the foreseeable future.*** Speakers ***There is no physical home button -- that round circle on the bottom is a second speaker. While the dual speakers provide more sound they can sound a bit flat. Not only that but if the volume is turned up there are times when it crackles. It’s especially noticeable with voices such as when listening to the robotic voice on Google Maps. If it didn’t sound fine when playing music I’d almost swear the speaker had blown.*** WiFi and Headphone Jack ***One Amazon reviewer mentioned WiFi issues when streaming Netflix videos. I tested watching Netflix and had no issues at all. Sure initially it might take the video a minute or so to fully load to remove the grain but once it’s loaded it became smooth for me. As far as volume level goes (using the 3.5mm headphone jack) it was just as loud as my Note 4; if not a tad louder. I tested this using my Bose SoundSport headset and listened to the same song switching back and forth between the two phones at full volume. Both were so loud it was easily beyond safe hearing levels. As note the song I listened to was streaming through Amazon MP3 and I didn’t have any choppiness either. I wonder if the user had a defective phone or if there were issues with their WiFi router. As for myself I’m using the D-Link DIR-880L through a SurfBoard SB6121 modem connected through a 50Mbps TimeWarner plan. While I did have issues downloading apps when trying to copy my data through my old phone I’ve not had any issues with a fresh configure. A 61MB app took about 20-seconds to download.####### SOFTWARE #######Initially I was surprised that “settings” wasn’t available when I did a drag down from the top of the screen but I found the trick to this. Drag down and then drag down AGAIN. The second drag down will reveal the settings icon at the upper right along with a more detailed battery indicator (shows the % remaining in number form).Like the Huawei OS there is no app drawer. Meaning you don’t get a menu button that shows all the apps on your phone. Instead they are placed on your home screens. This is more similar to iOS than typical Android but like iOS you can simply categorize apps into folders to keep things cleaned up and more organized. Instead of showing a folder icon it shows three icons from the group stacked together. (eg. You can name folders such as Games Production Reading Music Media etc. – if you don’t name the folders it will just show the icons). Additionally an A-Z listing of the apps is accessible at the bottom-right corner of the screen so you can easily find them without having to ransack numerous folders. For whatever reason the app icons don’t show alert numbers on them when you have something pending. For example I have Word With Friends installed. When it’s my turn to make a move on my Note 4 and iPad it shows a number indicating how many turns I have. On the Robin it doesn’t show anything. I personally miss this feature as it let me know which apps I need to take action on. Granted there’s still an alert sent in the notifications but those are easily dismissed without actually completing the action.While the dock at the bottom only lets you store four apps in a sense you gain a spot that isn’t forcibly being used by an app drawer. I’d have liked to be able to add a fifth app icon there but interestingly you can add folders to the dock. Meaning you can add more apps by overlaying them on top of one another. For instance I place Hangouts on top of Messaging and the Handouts icon peaked out behind the messaging one. When you click it they open up like a folder and from there you can click on which app you want to open. I also like that you can uninstall apps on the home screen (like the LG G4) rather than having to navigate to the Settings and Apps menu (like the Note 4). All you need to do is long press an icon and then drag it to the upper left where it says “Uninstall.”That said I’m not fond of how the Robin handles widgets. Before you could mix app icons folders and widgets on your home screen. Now you can only put app icons and folders there. Widgets require two fingers to pinch before a window opens to display them.  This would be fine if I wanted lots of space for widgets and if I wanted them separate but I don’t. I liked having my weather displayed at the top of my home screen for a quick glance at the temperature and I liked having commonly used app icons below it. I can’t do that with the Robin; I have to pinch to see the weather information -- but that’s not the only widget I use I also have music audio book and quick volume button widgets (eg. Home Work Sleep etc.) that I want quick access to. Being forced to pinch to see them is a pain to do one handed; try holding the phone in one hand while pinching with two fingers. It’s doable but awkward and increases steps to get to a place that came up instantly before. This is especially a pain when my phone is sitting on a mount in my car. Try pinching while driving after already having to unlock the phone. No more quick and instance access to widgets.While speaking of widgets the only one that appears on the home screen is the Google Search bar. I don’t want it. When I search Google I open Chrome. What’s more annoying is it appears on every single home screen panel. When long pressing the Google Search bar it doesn’t give me an option to remove it like I get with app icons. After doing some research I found the only way to torch the bugger is to disable “Google App” from the apps menu. Although all that accomplishes is to get rid of the Google Search bar; it didn’t let me put anything in its place so all I had was an unusable whitespace at the top of every home screen window.Another issue I had was connecting the device to my computer to transfer files. On my Windows 10 box I plugged in the Robin and Windows found drivers for it but when I put the phone in either MTP (file transfers) or PTP (photo transfers) it would only open a blank folder. By blank I mean Windows recognized the device -- showing the internal storage drive -- but it wouldn’t let me access the folders on it. Also when trying to add a file or folder I just got errors saying “The device has either stopped responding or has been disconnected” or “Cannot copy [file name]. The file may not exist or cannot be transferred.” I searched Google and did everything they recommended in multiple forums but still no good. I even went to far as to delete the drivers stored for the Robin for each USB port in the registry then downloaded and installed the Robin_USB_Driver_v1.0.1 listed on their forum. After rebooting both Robin and PC several times trying different USB ports reinstalling drivers etc. I got frustrated and gave up. On my Windows 7 box I plugged in the Robin only for Windows not to recognize it. That said when I installed the drivers mentioned above it worked. For whatever reason I’m not able to get the Robin USB MTP or PTP to work on my Windows 10 box but I was on Windows 7 using their custom drivers that I installed manually. It’s important to note too that the Robin defaults to “charging” every time you plug it into the PC so you’ll have to pull down your notifications tray on the Robin select “USB for” and choose MTP for each use.*** Preinstalled Apps ***Now with all that bad stuff out of the way here’s the real gem with the Robin. Compared to flagship creators like Samsung the Robin is free from a lot of junk. Every Samsung I’ve ever owned was riddled with grayware and bloatware -- and more than half of it was irremovable or un-freezable not without rooting. Even my LG G4 came with junk apps though not many as my Note 4. Not only are these unwanted apps annoying but they take up storage space and eat up physical memory which causes the phone to slow down. While strongly driven by Google apps the Robin has few apps overall and the ones it does are mostly useful. No crazy ad riddled games or pointless antivirus leaches eating up memory. This is especially important since this phone doesn’t have an app drawer which means junk would be even more in your face. The one thing I will say that does surprise me is that you cannot uninstall any of the preinstalled apps. That said a good number of them can be disabled. Another item to note is that the Robin doesn’t come with a file browser but you can easily nab a free one such as ES File Explorer or ASTRO File Manager on the Google Play Store.Below is a list of apps on the phone along with the control you have over them. (Note: there are more apps under the system but most of them are for functionality such as the fingerprints service.)*** Apps on the Home Screens ***Google Play StoreMSL Google Apps in one folderAndroid PayClockContactsDownloadsGallerySettingsCalculator*** Apps on the Dock ***PhoneMessagingGoogle ChromeCamera*** Apps that CAN be Disabled ***Android Live WallpapersAndroid PayCalculatorGoogle CalendarCameraGoogle ChromeContactsDevice Policy (comes disabled can enable)DownloadsGoogle DriveGalleryGmailGoogle AppGoogle KeyboardGoogle Play GamesGoogle Play Movies & TVGoogle Play MusicGoogle Text-to-speechGoogle Play StoreGoogle Zhuyin InputGoogle+HangoutsGoogle MapsMusicFXPhoneGoogle PhotosSettingsSIM ToolkitSmart storageYouTube*** Apps that CANNOT be Disabled ***BarCodeProjectClockGoogle TalkBackGoogle Play ServicesMessagingNextbit LauncherNextbit WallpapersSettingsSIM ToolkitSmart storageVoice Search (cannot disable in fact I don’t see it under the app list in settings)Overall for the value I think you are getting a nice device. It has a distinctive design unique cloud storage backup solid fingerprint scanner and isn’t littered with junk. That said I would have liked a larger and removable battery a microSD expansion slot widget support on my home screen and an included Quick Charge wall plug. I’m also longing for better cases; hopefully makers like Otterbox and Spigen will get into the game at some point.,1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        34 of 37 people found the following review helpful       The Truth about the Nextbit Robin.  January 12  2017By Edan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Okay so if your anything like me you do a lot of research before making any purchase especially when it comes to phone purchases. You wanna make sure your getting a good quality phone for the money your about to spend on a new device. At $160 the Robin is perfect. (And that's coming from an iPhone fanboy).××Build××Now a lot of reviewers give their opinion to help guide your decision yet none of the reviews I've seen read or watched really gave this phone the credit it deserved. The build quality on this thing is exceptional. Kickstarter project that actually turned out not half bad. Everything is put together like it should be and this phone feels premium. (as much as a poly carbonate phone can feel) It's the perfect amount of heft to make it feel secure in your hand while also being very light weight. (It's lighter than my 7 plus I switched from) the screen is a close second to my iPhones 7 Pluses IPS LCD display. At 5.2 inches it's not as big as my 7 but watching movies on it (by the way ""Storks"" was an excellent movie) is very doable and YouTube videos look crisp.××OS××Now like I said I'm an iPhone fanboy so Android is something to get used to. If your like me and switching from an iPhone this phone is the perfect middle ground as Nextbit OS (a lightly skinned version of Android) is very close to iPhone like homesceen setup with all your apps on the home screen and no ""app drawer"" (however adding a launcher can add that feature and more if you want an even more stock Android experience). The fact that this isn't full of bloatware/apps you really don't need makes this phone snappy out of the box. The Mint color throughout though may bother some people but it doesn't bother me. Nextbit is also good at every minor detail (when you swipe through screens you get a cloudy underlay behind your apps and above your wallpaper. Looks like a foggy cloud but it's really cool!) The phone ships with Android 6.0.1 with Nuguat coming soon. So it definitely will be updated to support newer emojis and etc.××Camera××This will probably be the shortest section but if your use to Android then this camera is a close third to it's Samsung/LG/Pixel counterparts. It's not iPhone quality but it's not security footage. It's doable. The back camera (13mp) is good takes nice photos in excellent lighting so outdoor shots will look gorgeous. The front camera (5mp) is again not iPhone quality but it's good. It's Snapchat worthy.××Battery××This phone has a MUCH smaller batter than I'm accustomed to however reviewers don't give this battery credit. The first day with the phone you will need to leave it on the charger because downloading and installing apps getting your contacts synced setting up your accounts etc. Will drain your battery as is expected the first day you get a phone. It comes with a USB type A to USB C cable but no charging brick. I would recommend buying a charging brick (wall port brick square piece thingy whatever you call it) that supports quick charge 2.0 because without it (or one of those apple chargers that come with iPads and such) your phone will charge mediocrely slow if your trying to charge and use it at the same time. This phone does however have a great battery for moderate usage and it has easily gotten me through a full day's worth of tasks (and I'm considered a power user)××Connectivity××Okay here's another vague topic that many don't talk about... It says that it doesn't support CDMA which is true HOWEVER both Verizon and Sprint use LTE which is a GSM technology. If your Verizon or Sprint phone has a sim card it CAN in fact be used with the Robin. You will not however get 3G coverage when outside of an LTE service area. Besides that you can use it on any GSM carrier as well. It has NFC so it supports Android pay. It doesn't have the magnetic field version so it will not work everywhere but only where it's supported. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 are in here as well and get great connection to both.××The Cloud××You get 32 GB storage on the phone (24.9 after formating) and 100GB additional cloud storage (free of charge). If you use up your 32 GB your Robin will automatically start backing up photos (recently Nextbit has started rolling out support for video as well as mines backs up videos) and app data to the cloud to make room. Need something just bring it down and it will be restored like it never left. Best bet is to leave the ""Backup on Wi-Fi only"" and ""When connected to charger"" settings alone unless you have an unlimited data plan and are okay with draining your battery a little faster.××Overall××It's a great phone for the price however it's not for everybody. Its for a specific niche. Also If you want this for the fact that it's different and you like the design definitely get the Mint color as it will turn heads (I got midnight and it's interesting still but Mint will get people talking). Too many reviewers try to put it on the level of phones built by OEM's that have the money to back a phone with better specs at a lower price however nextbit did a GREAT job with this one. It's not a Pixel or iPhone but it definitely will be competition very soon later down the road. Oh and Nextbit support is great. There's only one other company with support like Nextbit and that's Apple.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        15 of 16 people found the following review helpful       The Best Phone For Under $300  December 21  2016By Matthew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I went back and forth on ordering this phone but after it's recent price drop I took the gambled and placed my order and after two months with the device I'm very pleased with the purchase. Below is an in-depth review of the device but the TLTR review is simply that for this price point there is simply no other phone readily available in the US that compares to the Nextbit (other than possibly the Leeco S3 if you can catch it on a flash sale and if you can tolerate it's heavily skinned variant of Android.)DesignAt first glance the hard squared edges may be a bit off putting and make the device seem a tad unwieldy but due to a mix of it's width and being relatively thin it's actually very comfortable to hold.The muted pastel colors slab like form factor and the large circular speaker grills has intrigued many other individuals whom have seen me using the device and while it may not be as sharp as something like a Galaxy S6 or an HTC M10 it has a very distinctive charm that I've grown to really appreciate. There isn't much more to the device aesthetically outside of two sets of LEDs one being a set on the back that are used strictly when the Nextbit Cloud feature is enabled and when app data is being store or transferred to said service and then a small LED near the USB port that is used to indicate that the device is charging or will flash as a notification alert which is one of my few gripes with it's design the notification LED can be difficult to see and from what I can tell will not provide notifications while the device is charged.SoftwareThe software on the Nextbit has one me over more so than anything else with the device; which is near stock Android with the exception of a few color pallets being swapped to match the mint green associated with the device and having certain OS elements such as the notification slider having a transparent hue to them. These minor changes are actually pretty attractive and I haven't missed the muted pastel colors of stock Android in the least. From the get go the stock launcher that comes on the device is lacking an app drawer and is somewhat IOS inspired however this can be remedied with just downloading a new launcher; I'm running the Pixel launcher and other than the previously mentioned color swaps the device feels completely stock. The other aspect of the OS which is one of the ""selling points"" for the device is the cloud backup system which I honestly cannot comment too much on. While the concept of having a device that has near infinite storage is certainly an appealing idea I haven't encountered much of a need to utilize it as the on board 32 gigs of storage has yet to be filled yet. The cloud storage feature will also back up photos and documents which is a nice bonus but I've been using service such as Dropbox and Google Photos/Drive to cover that feature.HardwareFor being a phone that's currently under $160 there simply no other phone that matches the value to performance that is found here. While the Snapdragon 808 may be a bit long in the tooth at least in terms of the hardware cycles of cell processors it performs admirably especially when paired with the 3 gigs of RAM. In all my time spent using the phone so far in the 3 months I've owned it I've only encountered a very small handful of times when the device started to stutter which is just as much an issue with Android as a whole along with being what some would consider a ""power user"". Everything from high end games to loading 20+ tabs in Chrome have went through without any issues and I've very pleased with the overall performance. In terms of the screen it's an overall quality LCD screen with vibrant yet accurate colors and great viewing angles and while it may not be on par with OLED panels found on devices like Galaxy S6 again for the price it can't be beat. I've also been very pleased with the camera performance taking very high quality photos in normal lighting and handling low light photos admirably. Lastly is the fingerprint scanner which is reminiscent to the fingerprint scanners found on Xperia devices. While I would have preferred the scanner to be more in line with what's found on devices like the Nexus 6P/5X it works better than expected I will recommend though for the best performance scanning your most dominant fingers that will be used for powering on the device multiple times to ensure that an accurate read takes place.",0

I was going for the Nexus 5x and I'm sure I would've loved that too but the Nextbit was cheaper. Honestly for the price this is 7/5 stars. For me personally I just needed a phone that can do the basics (email internet news some apps reddit...) without slowing down. Sure it doesn't have the best camera the best battery life or even the fastest phone. But for $170 why are we even trying to make comparisons to $600 phones? This is serious quality right here.Pros:- Fast at least to me. My old phone started going to a crawl. I haven't noticed any slow downs.- Fingerprint scanner. This is neat. It's fast and works well.- NO BLOATWARE. This phone is SLEEK hardware and software wise. Very minimal in both regards. And I love me some minimalism.Cons:- Battery life is alright but this phone has Quickcharging and I always have a portable battery so no issue.- Camera is alright but I don't take that many phone photos and I have a DSLR if needed. But for the price it's a decent camera.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        24 of 27 people found the following review helpful       I Love This Thing  October 7  2016By Jacob Marley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I had given up writing reviews for Amazon right after I received a non-polite invitation to do so by some fellows in one of those countries over there for having the temerity to insinuate that their sucky product did in fact suck. That and my extreme disappointment at having been passed over for the Amazon In-House fake review Vine Program.However I am once again available for dancing and singing about the Nextbit Robin. It's great. Especially at the price I paid which wasn't much. I realize the raison d'être of this phone is the cloud storage thing but seeing that 32 GB was plenty big enough for what amounts to a burner phone I promptly loaded Nova Launcher and set it up as a ""Normal"" android device (See photo). The screen is a bit washed out and hard to use outdoors in sunlight but as I live in Cloudyville it's not a problem. The battery life is less than what should be considered acceptable. I am getting about three and one-half hours of screen on time during moderate use (Web surfing texting e-mail and a voice call or two) and it lasts me all day. A heavy user would need to recharge it before the end of the day. I also own and operate a Nexus 5x which has a similar processor and one less GB of RAM and the Robin seems snappier. It is running a version (Robin's Own) of Android 6.01 and an upgrade to 7.0 Nougat is promised.I intend to use this phone solely as a modem for tethering with occasional ""smart phone"" use. I have a car full of kids usually and a cellular WiFi connection and earphones for all hands keeps the noise and fighting to a minimum. For this purpose (with it plugged into a car or with an external battery pack) it kicks butt. Whoever put the t-mobile bands in this thing gave them super sauce. I'm in a Band 12 area and I get fast speeds up and down.So buy it. And thanks to the guy who didn't use it and returned it in mint condition so I could pay less than the prevailing rate which is still so much of a deal I may buy another.",1

February 2  2017By MotoB,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The device performance is snappy and paired with a very nice screen. The front facing speakers are clear though not particularly loud. A sore spot is the camera which is a tad slow to focus.The major problem though is that Nextbit the company has been bought out and the Robin discontinued.Furthermore the warranty has been reduced to 6 months.

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Just got this phone yesterday so this review is all about first impressions:  January 21  2017By Stuart and Lisa Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Day two and I love this phone. In my opinion - no offence to you folks that love your ""Flagship"" Android phones or are on the iPhone merry-go-round - paying $500 or more for a cell phone is the STUPIDEST thing ever. You know these things aren't difficult to break right? I need a phone. I like the gadgets and toys it provides but I don't really need them. I paid $159 for this phone. I can buy 5 of these for the price of your dumb iPhoneWhatever. The full retail of $299 is a fair price but at $159 it's a steal. This phone replaced my Moto X 2nd Gen. and I've been a Motorola phone user for three phones now (that's 6 years in people time).This phone is factory unlocked and your warranty is not void if you install a non-factory blob to it. This means I actually OWN this phone and can use it how I like. I will NEVER own another phone locked to a carrier or full of a crapload of stupid apps that some company makes me have. They tell you it's got 32GB then jam 12GB of junk on it that you can't remove unless you unlock the phone and void the warranty. Just stop buying phones from companies that do business that way and do us all a favor.The fingerprint scanner on the power button is pure genius and a bonus is quad-band meaning I can use it in Europe when we vacation there. 32GB of storage is huge stereo speakers 13MP camera Quick Charge capable what more can you want?More good:1. Love the shape and style. Square and flat is the new ""cool"" in cell phones in my opinion and this one is great looking. Slightly longer than my Moto X with the same screen size but thinner feeling because it's flat and the square edges make it way easier to keep a grip on.The nearly matching upper and lower bezels give the phone a visual balance that's appealing to the eye.The ""Mint"" color accents and visual effects are a nice change. I just couldn't see myself with a phone totally mint colored but my wife loved it - I got the dark colored one - she can get her own :)2. 100GB of cloud storage instead of a SD card slot. Automatically backing everything up is a great idea. No effort required and impossible to lose.The Bad: The only things I have to complain about are:1. The ""desktop"" has no way to hide every installed icon. In comparison the Motorola interface allowed me to remove the icon from the screens without uninstalling the app and instead access the app from the ""All Apps"" button. This phone has the All Apps button but it provides an alphabetical list of installed apps rather than usable access to an app. I have created various ""folders"" and stacked apps in them to get it down to only 3 screens worth of icons. I had like 7 screens full of junk before. Hmmm maybe I need to delete a couple things ya think? Maybe they'll fix this down the road.2. Occasionally I notice a slight hesitation in scrolling the screen like when on the 'net. I don't know if it's Chrome's fault or the phone's but I don't recall seeing this on my Moto X. It's not bad enough to be much of a bother.Re. comments from others: This is a new phone from a new startup. The first devices had a couple issues but it seems many of the bugs are worked out. I hope they can move the full retail price down to the $200 mark and improve the interface a little re. the app icons. As I just got the phone I can't comment on the battery life but I love that it supports quick-charging. I habitually charge my phones every night anyway so I doubt I'll care much about that.The only things I miss from my Moto are the active screen that gives you a glance at notifications and the clock without actually touching the phone and the gesture actions - double twist opened the camera and a double ""hatchet chop"" turned on the light. These functions are probably patented by Motorola so I'm not hoping to get them back with this phone.Final thoughts: This is not a $700 flagship phone but why do you need that anyway? Buy a cheap well-functioning unlocked phone like this one switch to a cell carrier and plan that's affordable and spend the dough on a great tablet instead.Your gaming and multi-media experience will be better and your money will go further. Even better; use the savings to take your spouse or best friend out for a wonderful evening instead. That will provide more enjoyment than any high-end phone will.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01D9LVCAI,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Great value.  January 11  2017By Chaimav,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This phone gets 5 stars for value. When I ordered it in the end of 2016 it had 2014 flagship specs and only cost $170. So why didn't I didn't just get a 2014 flagship then? The answer is updates. Phones that are 2 years old generally don't any more updates which I would lose both security updates and new features from android.Pros:-Value (specs vs price)-Fingerprint scanner works well.-Screen is very nice and clear.-Software updates. The beta version Nougat is already available and a final version should be released soon.-Openness. The company encourages unlocking the bootloader and installing custom ROMs. They even have a section on their website forum devoted to this. Furthermore this will NOT AFFECT THE WARRANTY. Feel free to play all you want.-The company. The company has been very engaged with it's customers. Very refreshing to see for a phone company.Cons-The camera is sub-par. While the color and white balance are OK and the pics are fine for social media when you zoom in they look pixelated and over processed. On the plus side it does support Camera2 API so you can download other camera apps with advanced features.-No USB OTG. This means that you can't use USB peripherals such as thumb drives.-Limited bluetooth protocols. Things connected over bluetooth like car stereos have no access to your text messaging.Meh (matter of personal taste):-The stock launcher. It doesn't have an app drawer and widgets aren't able to be placed on the wallpaper. You need to pinch the screen to access widgets. This is not a big deal as there are many 3rd party launchers out there.-Cloud storage. Personally I don't use this feature as I like to retain control of as much of my data as possible (yes I know Google and others already own me...). I would have preferred and SD card slot.Bottom line:If you don't need a great camera but want a solid phone for an affordable price this is for you.,0

Exemplifies the reason I chose Android over iPhone for is above exceptional performance. This isn't one of those cheap high quality looking Android phones that break down in a month.

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01LQV1YHO,ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5-inch Glacier…,        206 of 225 people found the following review helpful       Good AT&T LTE Midrange Camera Phone Value  but Beware Firmware Updates and Support  October 20  2016By Darren,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the USA warranty/spec version of the Zenfone 3 Laser ZC551KL as a replacement to an old Samsung Galaxy Note II and a Blu R1 HD that had a substandard camera.  Basically I wanted something no larger than the Note II preferably a little smaller and thinner.  I also preferred to keep the micro SD and micro SIM features so I can switch phones easily.  Finally I wanted a phone with at least a decent camera and Android 6 priced at $200 or less (off contract) so I can avoid lease fees and carrier surcharges.  Most importantly I wanted full AT&T USA LTE coverage including band 17.  This is one of very few phones that fit my requirements.  Note that Amazon has combined all versions of the Zenfone 3 into the same review listings.  This review is for the 5.5"" 2GB/32GB Laser version with USA warranty.Pros:Reasonably compact and slim for a 5.5"" screen.  At under $200 I don't even need to buy a case that adds bulk.  With only a screen protector it's very thin and fits nicely in a pocket and in my hand a bit smaller than the Note II overall.  If it breaks it's not so expensive to replace like a flagship phone would be.  The case is aluminum alloy according to Asus though it feels more like plastic.Display.  The screen is very bright at maximum settings and colors seem fairly vivid.  It only has full HD (1920x1080) but that's still very reasonable for a midrange $200 phone.  The viewing angles aren't as good as some top-of-the-line phones but you never even notice this unless your're sharing a video on a tabletop or something like that.  The auto-dim feature works well and you can adjust the baseline brightness for use with the automatic sensor too.  You can disable automatic to make it quite visible even in sunlight.Camera.  So far very good pictures and video.  Very impressive for a midrange model.  No issues focusing near or far and no problems with choppy video like my R1 HD.  My only complaint is that it won't allow for smaller image sizes.  Many times for online publishing I'd like to take 1920x1080 FHD images and not have to resize later.  I'm sure a third party app would resolve this so it's not a big deal.  It does have Sony imaging hardware and focusing is fast and accurate with short shutter delay so I haven't missed any photos so far due to blurriness or shutter lag.  Included is one example with good daylight plus one in a dark room using flash.  This isn't going to be a high end camera like on an iPhone Galaxy or other flagship smartphone but for the money I've been impressed.Full AT&T USA LTE compatibility.  Amazon didn't list LTE bands at the time of my purchase.  The Asus North America website only listed specs for the Japanese spec phone not the USA warranty version.  Asus Global correctly lists the USA spec phone bands and I confirmed these with Asus tech support: 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 17 28.  I have personally confirmed bands 2 4 and 17 with the latter perhaps being the most important one in areas that use it.  Note that it appears to lack band 12 which is the T-Mobile equivalent of band 17 so I can't comment on interoperability or compatibility for other networks.  So far I have had no issues with wi-fi or cellular data speeds on AT&T in the Chicago area.  If you are on T-Mobile the $149 Blue Life One X2 has similar specs and has band 12.  PLEASE NOTE: Most international versions of the Zenfone 3 DO NOT have the most important LTE bands for either AT&T or T-Mobile.  You must get the USA version for full LTE coverage on AT&T!Fingerprint scanner.  I haven't had one on my previous phones.  This is a great feature not only for security but also for ease of unlocking the phone.  It works very fast my home page appears in a fraction of a second every time.  You can also use a pin or swipe if you wish.  I appreciate the sensor on the back of the phone so it's very easy to unlock with one hand using your index finger.Dedicated back/home/apps bottom buttons.  I greatly prefer these to software buttons like on the Blu R1 HD.Reasonable power.  The Snapdragon 430 Adreno 505 and 2GB RAM seem much snappier than the R1 HD.  I've had very few issues with performance so far even after almost a month of use with all my apps installed.  I don't use my phone for gaming so it might not be a great performer for intensive apps but it works fine for browsing email Google apps and other typical apps.  My only complaint is that Asus should have included 4GB of memory like in other global markets.  I've had slowdowns when uploading media to Facebook that are resolved by clearing the memory with the Power & Boost android utility.  I usually average 1.5GB of 1.8GB free and I've made some efforts to prevent unnecessary stuff from loading.  So even 3GB would have made this a 5-star rating.Battery life.  Seems fine for a modest day of use.  I have no measurements but it seems to be as good or better than my other phones.  With brightness on automatic at the lowest base setting and airplane mode active I used it constantly on a 3 hour plane trip and ended up with 90% remaining.  I wish the battery was removable but the case cannot be opened easily.Quality.  The build fit finish and appearance are very good for the price.  Looks sharp.  The buttons on the side have nice tactile feel and work well.  Camera lens bulge is minimal.  So far no issues with excessive heat though it does get a little warm with extended video streaming.Android Marshmallow.  Seems like a fairly clean interface and works nicely so far.  No issues at all with reboots crashes and only minor issues sometimes when writing messages in facebook especially when uploading images or photos.Works right away.  Unlike my son's Zenfone 2 this one picked up network settings automatically so we didn't have to deal with figuring out how to resolve issues with data and MMS operation.  With Google backup and the Android Google ""Set Up Nearby Device"" utility everything copied over with minimal hassle.Micro SD card compatibility.  I have over 4000 songs and various other files and data on my SD card.  It's nice to be able to simply move it over to a new phone and go.  I've had no issues with playing music or finding files so far.  I am generally using Amazon Music for local music files and the Sirius XM app.Call quality.  So far so good.  Plus I get reception in my basement  My Galaxy Note II also did but the Blu R1 HD was hit or miss for calls and data.Amazon.  Great service as always.  Offered free next day shipping for Prime in my area.Cons:Updates and Support: Thanksgiving Day Asus pushed a firmware update that caused all affected units to no longer recognize their SIM cards.  The phones could not receive any cellular calls texts or data.  Despite numerous reports they told owners there was no possibility to roll back the firmware and that phones must be sent in for RMA repairs.  After 3 days they finally posted a firmware roll back on their website and forums that resolved the issue.Memory.  2GB is really barely sufficient for a midrange phone.  Global versions appear to have 4GB.  This one should have had at least 3GB.Color.  Honestly I wish it came in black gray or blue.  I have the silver which is fine and on the plus side matches my Lenovo Yoga 900S notebook.Bloatware.  Reasonable amount of junk apps that I will never use and cannot be easily uninstalled.  I could do without ZenUI and almost all of these useless apps.  Considering the marginal 2GB of memory any stuff that can be removed so it is never loaded is a benefit.The headphone volume isn't as loud as I'd like.  Call volume speakerphone volume and bluetooth audio volume in my car all seem to be good though.Lacks Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 though the chipset supports it.  Charging times seem typical.Conclusion:This is not a flagship phone and it's not even comparable to other Zenfone 3 models.  Those all cost $400 to $800 off-contract and offer a lot more features.  This is a midrange phone and a good one.  I give it 4 stars for a $200 unlocked Android 6 phone with full AT&T LTE compatibility.  The poor support and minimal 2GB of memory keeping it from a full 5-stars at this price.  Many inexpensive phones do not include the all the essential AT&T bands which may not be an issue in some areas but will be in others.  In particular band 17 is absent on many budget models but is included on the USA spec Zenfone 3 models.  The display camera and fingerprint sensor are standout features at this price point.  The main competition right now in the USA seems to be the slightly smaller 5.2"" Blu Life One X2 which has a similar feature set and is somewhat less expensive at $149.  The $199 version as more RAM and storage and might be a good alternative.  The Blu Vivo 5R and Moto G4 Play are also similar with slightly less powerful processors and cameras.",1

January 4  2017By Waukesha04,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Last summer I broke my Samsung Galaxy S5. At that time I bought a BLU Advanced 5.0 for $59.00 (Terrible phone). I needed an upgrade but I didn't want to get stuck in AT&T monthly purchase plan for a new phone. I did some research and saw this phone. I have been a fan of ASUS Computers. I ordered it through Prime at 8 pm. It came by noon the next day! I love you Amazon!. Anyways the phone was impressive right out the the box. It looks so sleek and thin. In the box; Charger phone SIM card tool and instructions in a few languages. I stuck my AT&T SIM card and my MicroSD card in and fired it up. I am not a tech expert. It walks you through set up so nicely when you get started. Within 5 mins I had a fully set up phone. It even will install apps from your old phone automatically if you wish (I have no idea if that is common but its nice).  The phone is responsive and fast. The touch screen is sensitive in a good way. I love the fingerprint unlocking feature. It also lets you set up other apps to have it log in with your fingerprint. I was able to set up my banking app login in with a fingerprint (instead of my normal password) How cool is that!? The camera seems good so far. I just snapped a few pics around the house. It does focus and snap very quickly. The Screen is bigger than I expected when I ordered it. It looks really nice.  There are a few ASUS apps that I can't imaging wanting that come on the phone but not a big deal. The ASUS User Interface seems simple and logical.  Overall for $200 the phone is a great alternative to walking into a store and laying down $600. I also think its better than buying a used/refurbished phone.,0

Use it for work and play.  Been using it over a week and zero issues.  Setup was easy.  At home put SIM card in from old AT&T Samsung phone and within an hour my apps and contacts transferred over. Wife's Samsung Galaxy 6 is very comparable.  ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser is a bigger screen finger print security and just as fast without the $20 a month contract.Pros:Good Battery life. (12-14 hours heavy usage)Easy to setup from old phone.Camera is good.Opens apps fast.Screen is clear and bright.Call quality is good.Text Facebook Outlook email works exactly the same.Finger print scanner works great.Cons:No lights on the home button.Limited accessories.Lots of preloaded ASUS apps but some are very useful and hasn't slowed down performance.Very well made fast as advertised and great alternative to flagship phones that cost 2x or 3x the cost.  This family will probably never buy a phone from a cellular carrier again.,0

My wife has a Samsung S7. The specs are very close. Asus has 3.5 gig memory Samsung has 3 gig. They both use android 6.0 marshmallow OS. Cameras are very similar. Asus  does not have wireless charging. Asus has a bigger screen. Other than those differences they are basically the same with a much lower price tag. Storage is the same.

December 12  2016By John E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is for the MAX not the 5.5 laserPros:4100mAh - reason I bought this phoneVery long battery life even with wifi and apps running.Decent price for what you get feels solid in terms of build.Screen is very vibrant no issues with the quality(even if it isn't 1080)Finger print scanner work wellSurprisingly snappy for a budget phone with 2GB of ramPhone can also charge other devices with it's dongleDecent camera both front and backComes with a 2.0 Amp charger(more of on FYI than a pro)Cons:I knew these features were missing prior to buying the phone that is why I am not taking off any eggs-No gorilla glass-Apparently no fast charging but I haven't had any issues with power given the large battery-Not 1920x1080 screen I hear that there is a version of this phone out there with one but can't find it on sale anywhere-CPU is a little underpowered however this is to extend battery life. So far aside from the initial out of the box set up I haven't had any speed issues-roughly 6.8GB left free on the phone itself after OS + updates it will take an SD card so for me the free space is enough-Blutooth seems to drain battery faster than other things might be fixed in a firmware update(?)-Asus android updates are slow but that is the company thing not the phoneSide notes:This is a BUDGET phone with a focus on BATTERY LIFE. If you aren't looking for one of those two things when considering this phone please don't rate the phone low because you didn't understand the market it is targeting. I travel a lot for work and I got tired of carrying around a spare battery or a usb charger so far this battery is lasting far longer than anything prior I have owned. I wouldn't buy this if I was going to focus on gaming or powerful apps spend the 30-50 dollars and get the Laser or a Honor 5x for a good mid range phone. This is by no means a power users if you want a powerful flagship phone obviously you won't find it for <150. If you are looking for a good phone focused on long battery life even with wifi and other things running this is a great phone for you.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MRZFBBH,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        206 of 210 people found the following review helpful       Honor next budget friendly phone. How does is it compare to the 5x?  January 14  2017By Bbta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Update:I am changing the review to 5 stars. After few more days of use: the 6x clearly outranks the 5x in design (which is growing on me) WiFi and cell reception performance and battery life.Honor 5x was the first true “budget” smart phone. Metal design and fingerprint sensor where rarely seen on any phone with close price tag at that time are becoming more and more standard now. That being said that device had some shortfalls. The performance with the snapdragon was lacking under pressure and the EMUI android skin is not everybody’s cup of tea. Today we look at the true successor of the Honor 5x with similar price tag. How did the devices rank against each other? And are the differences worth the extra $80 or so? (Both available on Amazon now for $249 vs $169)Un-boxing and accessoriesPretty standard boxes with nothing fancy for both. Accessories much easier to find for 5x but 6x is just launched so I am sure it will catch up. Not much to talk about here.DesignBoth are gorgeous. I had the gold Honor 5x and now compared to the gray Honor 6x they both look way much more premium than their price tag. You could easily mistake them for a $600 phone. That being said the Honor 6x is more round around the edges has more mate finish on the back (both has aluminum body) and feels more comfortable to hold. Honor did improve the design but not much. Honor 6x still is marginally better.Processor RAM and performanceHonor 5x had the more widely known Snapdragon 617 while Honor opted for the in house Kirin 655. Honor 5x had 2 GB of RAM and 6x has 3 GB (in USA anyway). On paper the Kirin outperforms the Snapdragon (it is actually more in line with Snapdragon 625-650). This is confirmed by multiple benchmark tests although I will not bore you with the details (easily obtainable by googling both processors). Kirin also seems more power efficient thanks to the more semiconductor size (28 nm vs 16 nm) which should translate into more less heat generation as well. How did this translate into real life performance? Both devices perform well for everyday use. You will notice a slight hiccups here and there for the honor 5x particularly when opening apps (Google maps seems to take few seconds) and this becomes more prominent when you install more apps (I had 100+ apps installed). The 6x seems to handle this much better. The lag is almost non-existent and apps open up quickly (even google maps! I hated those extra seconds of waiting on 5x when checking traffic in the morning before I head to work – no more with 6x!). Is it the new processor? Is the extra RAM? Being an in house chipset optimized more to work with the user interface? Or is it simply that devices become slower with time and the 6x will follow lead? Could be any of those but for the time being I have to go with the 6x as a winner!One last word: my only concern regarding the 6x is the GPU (which handles the display and 3d part gaming mostly). The GPU on the 5x is Adreno 405 – no match for much better GPUs in today’s flagships but performs OK and tried in and out. The Mali T830MP2 is not as much. They both seem to handle things comparably now but will see how the Mali handles games released a year or two from now.ScreenBoth are gorgeous. Is this the best screen around? No. but for practical purposes both did great with a small edge for the 6x colors seems more accurate. However for the price range they may be the best you can get and it looks amazing for watching a movie or displaying pictures. Given the slightly higher price tag for he 6x I would say this is a tie.CameraBoth perform adequately. Both are poor in low light situations. Both will take OK pictures. Did the two lens format in the 6x make a huge difference? In my personal opinion no. The second Camera is not a monochrome camera like you see in pricier phones and mostly functions to give that nice background blurring but not much more. This seems odd as the two lens format seems to be a selling point to Honor but the phone has more to offer anyway. This is a tie.SoftwareThis is where it gets messy. You will always hear bad things about EMUI. Let me get out of the way: It is not as bad as people make it look like. It is just different. It is somewhere in the middle of Android and iPhone and I think it took some nice features from both (I like that you can search for apps simply by swiping the home screen down like you can do on iOS). You still get the customizations of android you get the widgets and you get the ability to run 3rd party launcher (Nova launcher seemed to make my honor 5x faster). But it is not stock android. If you like android as it is do not go for this one. If you don’t mind Honor tweaks then I think you will do fine with both. For what it is worth I think the EMUI is one of the best android skins to prevent battery drains – it seems well optimized.As far as comparing the two devices: while it is disappointing that Honor 6x launched with EMUI 4 on android M we are promised an update to Android N with EMUI within weeks. Honor kept their word re updating the 5x from android 5 to 6 so hopefully they will keep their track record.This is also a tie.BatteryHonor 5x best selling point for me was the battery. No it will not last 2 days 3 days or longer. No you will not get 10 hours of screen on time. But that is not what I am looking for in a phone. I am looking for a phone that can give me few hours (3-5 at least of screen on time) to check my emails and browse internet may be the occasional game or two and not drain itself to death when I am not using it. Basically I want a phone I can use moderately with no need to charge mid day. You would think this is easy to get but to me it was not. I tried several phones at this price range and higher since my nexus 4 died. I tried Lg g2 xperia z1 and z2 nexus 6p (yes) note 4 and Axon 7. They all had one issue or the other. My biggest problem that I do not get good reception in my work area where I spend several hours a day and this seems to suck the life out of every battery I tried. My phone would go from 100 in the morning to 40 or so while not being used but rarely. Not with Honor 5x. I finally would be able to go home with 50 – 60% + when I get home with moderate usage and 2-3 hours screen on time. It may be the software or the way honor handles the bad reception but that was why I stuck with the 5x for a year. Honor 6x seems to follow lead as well and I have no issues using it for 2 days with light use. It also lacks true quick charging but it charged to 100% in about two hours. At the price range I really do not care about the extra 30 min it seems to take when compared to say Axon 7 which took me around an hour and a half to fully charge. So far both devices perform well. A slight edge for honor 6x.MiscellaneousThey both have fingerprint scanner. For all intents and purposes is it excellent and it does not get much better than this. I cannot remember last time I had to try more than once to open the device. It works while screen is off (unlike older Samsung models where screen had to be turned on manually first). The honor 6x sensor is faster than the 5xBoth are fully compatible with T mobile and AT and T. LTE is excellent: I get around 10-15 mg download speed in a major metro area. It does have band 12 on t mobileBoth have double sim the second sim doubles as an SD card slot in both6x is reported to have an IR port but I am unable to get it to work yet! no built in remote control app.Both have the much more available USB 2 for a charger. While this may become problematic years from now for the time being to me this an advantage. You can use any old android charger with no need for adaptersVerdictThis is an excellent phone. I am really happy that so called mid-range phones are getting better and better each year. It will not disappoint you and will perform more than adequately for everyday use and then some more. After few more days of use the much better battery life design and performance easily justifies the price difference. Good work Huawei!,1

January 28  2017By Jenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am a recent iPhone convert. I have worked in the mobile industry for years and always look for a phone that will give me bang for my buck. This phone completely fits the bill. The display is crisp the photo quality is excellent the ability to add memory invaluable. It does lag sometimes but not so bad that I'm ready to throw it out the window. I love the fingerprint sensor by the time my phones at my face it's unlocked and ready to go. The FM radio is a great bonus too. I just received it yesterday and am activating it on AT&T's prepaid plan. I'm looking forward to seeing how the phone's service runs - I'm sure I'll be pleasantly surprised.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MRZFBBH,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Camera  Amazing Battery Life  and overall Top-Tier Budget Device!  February 21  2017By Thomas-Hintzel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I switched to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy Edge S6. This may seem like a massive downgrade for some folks but I am actually enjoying the Honor 6X more than the Edge S6 which I'll explain below in my comprehensive review.Body/Form-Factor (4/5):The Honor 6X isn't anything really spectacular to look at but it feels durable and nice in the hand. It's aesthetic is decently pleasing to me. I do not enjoy phones that are trying to be overly flashy or fancy (mainly because I put a case on them anyway). It fits well in the hand and I love that all the buttons are on the right-side. The S6 has the volume buttons on the left-hand side which was annoying for one-handed use. The placement of the fingerprint reader is amazing I have seen it on the back in other phones but I think Huawei found the sweet-spot for me. It's in the PERFECT place for my long fingers. Otherwise the build-quality is solid it doesn't feel like it would explode on impact if I dropped it. On the other hand the S6 was nasty-feeling without a case with all the glass and was so thin I feared shattering it.Display (4/5):For a mid-range budget phone the display is very attractive. There is some slight saturation on blacks and reds seem to POP with intensity. This is especially noticeable using the camera. However I am fond of black-themed UIs so I have black on black and it actually looks very nice without too much saturation. You're not going to get the intense color-ranges you will with Samsung's AMOLED screen. The Honor 6X is a standard IPS LCD screen coming in at 1080x1920 with a ~403 PPI density. Better than other mid-range devices and you really can't beat that for the price. The screen is crisp and clear if you're comparing it to a high-range phone you're going to be disappointed. However remembering you only paid ~$250 (as of this review) then you'll be pleasantly surprised! I have used the phone in bright light and darkest night with no issues. Screen is amazing for the price but there are better screens on higher-end phones (if you want to pay for them that is).Screen Physical (2/5):I had to say something about the actual GLASS that comes with the device. It comes with a pre-installed screen protector it doesn't look like a factory film it literally looks like a SCREEN PROTECTOR (however it's really not it's just a cheap plastic thing that doesn't like to come off). If you're buying this phone do yourself a favor and GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP. I always protect my devices with either a glass or the ""liquid"" screen protectors (the gel-like kind) and this phone absolutely has to have one. I did a screen stress-test and it received several small scratches just by being in my pocket for a day without a protector something a phone with any kind of tempered glass or gorilla glass would not do. It's not super bad you're not going to encounter any massive scrapes from daily use if you carry it without anything else in your pocket but you WILL get a lot of small annoying scratches. The good news is any glass or gel screen protector will cover those right up!Launcher Emotion UI (3/5):EMUI get's a pretty bad rap but it's honestly not THAT bad. My biggest gripe is the lack of an app drawer it forces everything to the main screen which can get pretty cluttered even if you're using the folders. Alas this is not a heavily weighing factor for me because third-party launchers exist. Other than that it's a fairly standard launcher it's actually very snappy and fast. If you can get over the no app drawer then it shouldn't be an issue at all.Speed/Snappiness/Responsiveness (5/5):The Honor 6X is sporting a Kirin 655 2.1GHz Cortex-A53 (with a Mali-T830MP2 GPU) which is an impressive chip for the price. I did a stress test with YouTube a 3D game Facebook Chrome (with multiple windows) Google Maps and Google Music all in the background of the device at once and saw only a minimal amount of device lag. Albeit in reality I wouldn't have all those things open at once anyway. Standard use sees absolutely no lag and the device is always incredibly responsive. One of the biggest issues I have had with trying out mid-tier budget phones is that after a couple of apps open they DRAGGGGG to almost a halt before closing something. This phone handles it like a bloody champ!External SD Card Slot (5/5):Thought I'd just add this here most expensive phones these days are sorely lacking this and I do love to download everything and anything. Especially since I use my device everyday as a music player so I require a lot of space! You can add a 256 GB SD card for all your HD videos and music on the go!Camera (5/5):This is really where this phone SHINES. All the other mid-tier phones I have tried all have a terribad camera. I mean it's normally VERY bad. If you're in the market for a budget phone and want a nice camera look no further. This camera rivals my Edge S6 (which I have touted as the best camera on any smartphone when it came out). The camera app has a bunch of awesome built-in features and you can tell they spent some time here. The Pro Photo mode really lets you change anything you want to get that AWESOME shot. HDR works as intended. The ""Good Food"" option seems to be some sort of macro setting accentuating the warm tones. The ""Light Painting"" feature is actually really cool it mimics and recreates those cool light-shots you can get from moving cars or spelling stuff out with lights! I had great fun with the ""Slo-Mo"" mode where you can make things slow motion and even edit whatever is slow motion at the end of it. The ""Document Scan"" mode works AMAZINGLY. It will auto-snap and crop any document you're currently trying to take a picture of and then auto-edit it for readability. I used it at work to take a lazy-screencap of a document on my computer monitor and it worked GREAT!The secondary camera is actually very very nice. Coming in at 8MP and an auto-beauty mode for those flawless selfies! It has all the same features as the standard camera so they didn't skimp on all the features just because it's a secondary.I'd also like to add that Huawei integrated a classic Gallery instead of incorporating Photos like almost every other phone has done. I really miss the old-school gallery and I thank Huawei for actually including one instead of me having to pay for a decent one through Google Play.Sound (2/5):The headset speaker is decent you can definitely hear people. They're not particularity crisp or mega-clear. You can certainly hear them just fine the loudness isn't a big issue. The call quality is varying it might be my service who knows. The speaker is sorely lacking it's not loud and at it's max volume it kind of sounds like a muffled room noise. It's not AMAZINGLY bad but if you're an audiophile looking for a decent speaker this is not the budget phone for you (I don't think audiophile and budget should be used in the same sentence). It gets the job done I usually carry headphones or a bluetooth speaker with my anyway so this didn't shy me away from the phone at all so I don't weight very heavily on this part.Ports/Comms (3/5):The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 3/5 is because it lacks 5 GHz Wi-fi. Something that seemingly every other mid-tier phone has incorporated Huawei decided to just not on the Honor 6X. This is a bit annoying to me because I was seriously spoiled on my 5 GHz wi-fi at my house. No NFC so if you're looking to use Android Pay you'll probably have to sync a smartwatch to the phone! Other than that there's v4.1 bluetooth chip with all the trimmings it works flawlessly and amazingly. It doesn't seem to use any power at all!MicroUSB. Really Huawei? C'mon you could of scored a 5/5 with me with USB-C and 5 GHz wi-fi! With almost every other phone moving over now to USB-C (sans Samsung) it would seem natural that Hauwei would do this. They're already using it on all their other flagship phones. I guess it was to save on the price which I can totally get. However I really really love USB-C.Fingerprint Reader (5/5):Thought I'd throw this in here because most fingerprint readers are just awful. Not in terms of functionality but in positioning. The reader on the Honor 6X is AMAZINGLY places for actual use. The S6 Edge has it on the front of the phone which is useless for me because I normally place my phone face-down or it's in my pocket with the screen toward me. The response time on the reader is insane! One micro-second tap and BAM you're in. At first I thought it was fake so I had several buddies try it and NOPE! Wouldn't let them in. Way to put an awesome reader that definitely rivals the high-end phones Huawei!Battery (5/5):Wow my S6 Edge had a terrible battery life if you compare it to the Honor 6X. I use data bluetooth wi-fi and max screen brightness everyday. I'm a Reddit and YouTube lover so I'm constantly on those throughout the day. With all that on using a Reddit app probably ~20 times a day and watching about ~30 minutes of YouTube everyday I still get home after a 12 hour work-day with about 40% battery left. With my S6 I ALWAYS had to plug it in mid-day because it would be at 10% at 3 PM. With the Honor 6X I just plug it in once a night and leave it there. On my days off I don't even have to charge it at night it's normally sitting at about 80% without heavy use. There's also a ""Phone Optimizer"" built in that helps extend battery life. It will even tell you how much battery life it might save if you turn off X feature.Overall (5/5):Despite the small downsides the Honor 6X comes in swinging at a $250 price point. If you're looking for a feature-packed phone that has an awesome camera and amazing battery life LOOK NO FURTHER! I am currently using this device as my main device. I have NEVER used a mid-tier budget phone as a main device but this one really bit me! Great job Huawei the Honor 6X is awesome!",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MRZFBBH,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       A truly outstanding phone  for an amazing price.  February 14  2017By Jackie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After dealing with unreliable phone service providers (I'm looking at you Virgin Mobile and Straight Talk) and glitchy phones (I'm looking at you LG Volt and Volt 2 as well a a Samsung Galaxy phone) that consistently contained way too much bloatware (because of said unreliable phone services) and eventually started to die faster and faster I decided to do a lot of research for a few months before deciding which phone brand and service provider I would switch to.I was initially looking at the Honor 8 but the price was a bit steep for me so I decided to wait. I'm a firm believer in that you don't need to spend $400+ on a good phone and that the best phone service doesn't have to cost you hundreds of dollars a month. After taking a small break from research I came back to Amazon and found this phone last week. The price was nice and while the reviews were mixed I decided to take a plunge and buy this phone after watching a few videos about it and reading articles about it. I also ditched Virgin Mobile in favor of Cricket (which has been amazing so far! I actually get reception at home in the middle of my rural/ghost town).The phone arrived two days after I ordered it and the battery was at 60% battery out of the box giving me the ability to activate it right away and play around with it. A lot of these reviews complain about the operating system skin/EMUI (along with various other things) but honestly it's not all that different to me. Maybe it's because I adapt really quickly to things and have a fast learning curve (and am pretty tech savvy for not knowing all the correct terminology).Before I list positives and negatives let me just say that the most important things to me in a phone are internal storage space processing power and battery life. Oh and of course customization capabilities (like changing font faces) GPS and a nice set of front and back facing cameras. I don't care so much about having to learn or adapt to a new style of system since I enjoy learning about them and getting used to them on my own.POSITIVE POINTS1. Internal Storage: which allowed me to uninstall the useless apps that were pre-installed. The capacity also allowed me install all the apps that I previously had spread out between different devices (because each one had bloatware that couldn't be uninstalled or disabled). It also gave me the ability to add new games/apps that I've been wanting to try. Even after installing all the apps I wanted to as well as migrating data from apps I previously used (including: Discord Kingdom Hearts Unchained X Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag Mystic Messenger Sailor Moon Drops Alphabear. Pokemon GO [which I can actually use AR mode finally] TsumTsum Steven Universe: Soundtrack Attack Tumblr Instagram Snapchat LINE LINE Camera Layout Bitmoji LINE Webtoon Zedge and Huawei Themes) I still have more than half of my internal storage space free.2. Battery Life/Processing Power: if you read through my long list of apps above then you can guess I enjoy a fair amount of mobile gaming and a little bit of social media in my spare time. This phone doesn't slow down and doesn't overheat while I play for hours when I get the chance for it. The battery of course drains but not anywhere near as quickly as my old phones/devices did.  After a full charge I was able to enjoy 8-10+ hours of gaming and switching from app to app without having to worry about recharging. When the phone isn't in use the battery life is even more impressive barely draining from hour to hour. I went from having to charge my previous devices multiple times a day or having them die out on me to only needing to charge once a day usually at night/when I go to bed. I also love not having to deal with crashing apps/glitchy apps.3. Cameras: perhaps because my previous experiences with phone cameras have been full of disappointments I can easily say that the cameras on this phone are 100% fantastic. Even though I don't take a lot of selfies I do take lots of pictures of things aside from myself (like nature food arts/crafts scenery etc.) and the images come out crystal clear and pretty vibrant unless it's in a low-light setting. Of course I rarely would even think of taking a photo in that environment so that doesn't bother me or dull my enthusiasm for this phone. I look forward to being able to play around with my cameras more.4. Fingerprint Scanner: I just think this is a really cool feature now no one but me can unlock my phone which is pretty awesome. I have had no problems with it and setting it up was really simple and quick.5. GPS/Compass: Since playing Pokemon Go this became something of great importance to me. My previous devices were absolutely terrible when it came to playing this game. However this phone has given me the smoothest experience with absolutely no GPS-related problems.6. Graphics: To be concise the graphics/display quality on this phone is easily a 10/10 for me. Youtube videos and all my game/apps look sharp and clear. The colors aren't dull or overly vibrant.NEUTRAL POINTS1. Customization: If you like me enjoy changing fonts then you'll need to install an app like Huawei Themes which provides a nice selection of font faces to use. It's a bit of a shame that there aren't options other than the default font pre-installed but this doesn't bother now that I have an app for that.2. Speaker: I usually use my headphones but on the random occasion that I decide not to I will admit the speakers tend to be on the quieter side until you turn the volume up 70% or more. It's not that big a deal but I thought to just put that out there for honesty's and informing others' sake.3. I am used to having the option to move an app's data from the internal storage to an SDcard. This phone as far as I've explored doesn't provide the option to do so. This doesn't bother me because I have plenty of internal storage for apps and plenty of external storage for everything else so this is just something I thought to note.NEGATIVE POINT1. Not enough case options though this doesn't reflect so much on the phone's manufacturer as it does on those who manufacture phone cases. I just really want to be able to buy a clear plastic case for this phone (for decoden) and character cases (like Rilakkuma  Gudetama or Stitch or just in general cute cases) but I can't because there aren't any. I had to settle for a basic dual layer case (the case provides really nice protection though). Just in case any of you need a case here's the link: Honor 6X Case with Built-in Stand SPARIN Rugged Dual Layer Cases for Huawei Honor 6X 2017 with [360 Degree Ring Stand] [Corner Protection].,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MRZFBBH,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Great budget phone  February 12  2017By Joel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,While not as fast as some more expensive and high end phones it does what all smartphones do goes on the internet access to apps and makes calls. Got this phone as a replacement for my wifes Note 4. I think she likes this phone just a bit more than her Note. It's not packed with all the gimmicky features as the Note or other phones but it does everything else. Not sure on NFC for Android pay since I don't use phone. It's very light almost to the point I thought it was a fake phone. Camera isn't going to win awards but does a decent job. Screen is nice and clear. The biggest and best thing about this phone is the battery life. My wife gets about a day and a half on a full charge. Not bad at all considering she's a power user on the phone or maybe she finally realized she killed her Note by being on it all day even while charging. Either way it has fast charge and expandable memory something else she was looking for. All in all for not having to go to the store to upgrade an increase our bills it's one of the best buys we've done. Just put a glass screen protector on it for her sake. No app drawer easy fix I put nova launcher on there and tweaked it a bit and she loves it. Not bad indeed. Probably will.look another phones for upgrades in the future. OnePlus 3T for me I think.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MRZFBBH,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        8 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Best Phone so far  January 21  2017By Alex Li,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Totally when from an iPhone user to android and staying android afterward.  $250 for a quality phone like this one there really should be no complaint.  32gb to start. Great battery life that last over a day with heavy usage.  Duo Camera rear and great front camera taking.  The screen resolution are great.  The size of the phone is great. fitted well in hand and comfy.  Very light compared to a smaller previous phone I got.  Super fast at charging too ( if you put it in ultra life mode to charge.  1% -about 2 hours for fully charge).  Phone itself got really great features and customize option that your guys can explore yourself.  Fingerprint scanner unlocked ARE crazy fast- no joke about that in 0.3 sec.  I don't understand why would I ever spend more money on phone when there one like this out there.  You NOT getting anything better anyway.  beside most phone life span 1-3 years.  Even you didn't physically damage it. the manufacturer will make it not lasted out.  New software draining you battery like madness.  incompatibility of apps ect.  that's just how business do thing.  But when you paying for a great phone like Honor 6x for 1/3 of the price.  You can get one every year just to get one lol.,0

It's performance is out standing  January 20  2017By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Exactly 7 days using this device and I'm in love. It's performance is out standing it's camera is way better then I thought it would be. I tested its camera with an iPhone 7 and it's almost impossible to see any difference in some pictures the 6x is even better. So many of its futures come in handy. I get  one day and a half using it for phone calls all day at work. And tested using it as less as possible and I passed two days with out recharging. It's got an expensive feel to it and at its price you don't care if you take it work beach or even lose it. Great  phone!,0

February 9  2016By Vine Invite please 907,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had every budget smartphone out every BLU MOTO Sony experia nexus 5 nexus 6 and this is by far my favorite some people don't like the stock UI but i think its something new and interesting downloading Google Now is a must stock launcher does not have an app drawer . The finger print scanner works seamlessly into the design and functionality It took me a day to remember to set my finger on the back and it takes .0000005 seconds to read the print to unlock the phone. The screen is super bright and crisp the only downside is the black border around the display but its hardly noticeable. The Honor 5X is hands down the best budget phone on the market it hasn't lagged out on me once and i haven't had an app crash yet. Metal body is smooth and could pass for a HTC A9 I still don't know how this phone is only $199.00 Usually big companies cut corners on budget smart phones as i have found out first hand. the Moto G looks like your playing minecraft with the screen resolution the nexus 5 was all plastic every BLU phone has a crappy screen software oh and the most important thing BLU phones come with S*** hardware. I haven't found one corner Huawei Has cut GOOD JOB CHINESE FELLOW who designed this one keep em coming.Thanks from Alaska Im Paul and please remember [...],0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWR0,Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone 16GB…,        1 234 of 1 283 people found the following review helpful       The first ‘real’ budget phone that’s worth the money  February 5  2016By Wilfred,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,OVERVIEWThe Huawei Honor 5x is the first of its kind. It’s not a game changer in terms of the latest and the greatest. It’s a game changer in that it’s the first ‘real’ low cost phone that has a metal body large battery beautiful screen fingerprint reader decent cameras and a decent processor.For the longest time phone makers reserved metal smartphones and fingerprint readers for their ‘flagship’ models. Only those who pay $600+ (un-subsidized) would have the luxury of accessing those new features. The Huawei Honor 5x was designed to disrupt that philosophy.For reference my previous phones were:Nexus 5Oneplus OneOneplus TwoNexus 5xVALUEAt a very low $200 price point at launch the Honor 5x is currently one of the best values in terms of specs features build material and support. To get to that price point Huawei had to cut back on a few things like NFC a faster processor and a camera quality. This may sound like a huge deal breaker and it may as well be if you’re coming from a flagship phone from any other maker but at $200 what the Honor 5x is able to pack into the phone is way better than any other phone in that same price range. (Name a metal high quality phone with a fingerprint reader that can be purchased at $200 at launch day. 02/05/2016)SPEED***Update 02/19/2016 After nearly 20 days using this phone as my primary phone I'm finally ready to comment on the performance. Comparing the Honor 5x with my previous phone the Nexus 5x I would have to say that they seem identical. I actually haven't notice any significant lag on the Honor 5x whereas with my Nexus 5x I've notice significant lag with similar apps. Just as a disclosure I do not play mobile games much so I can't vouch whether this phone would be great for gaming. ***FINGERPRINT READERThe Honor 5x’s fingerprint reader is pretty snappy. I can and probably will say that it’s quicker than the Nexus 5x’s fingerprint reader. Every time I’ve used it to unlock the phone it’s done so smoothly and without any issues. What’s neat about their fingerprint software is that they’ll allow you assign specific privacy settings or actions per finger. An example is that I have set my left hand middle finger to unlock the phone in Guest Mode. This will hide all the apps I would prefer to be private (ie. Amazon whatsapp tinder okcupid etc). What I have noticed though is that when opening up in ‘Guest Mode’ the apps that are marked private will be viewable for a second before they disappear. This may be the limitation of the processor or maybe the coding in the software. Hopefully this is something that can be updated in future updates.CAMERAThe Honor 5x’s camera isn’t the best in low light. So far a majority of my shots has been indoors of my dog and food and I’ve found that the images look a bit dull. The camera is quick. Quicker than the Nexus 5x camera but I don’t think it’s as vivid as it could be in low light.ALUMINUM METAL BODYThe most noticeable feature of the Honor 5x would have to be the metal body. Huawei used quality build materials for this phone and it shows. It feels and looks like a premium phone.3000mAh BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on the Honor 5x is forever. It has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S Plus which says a thing or two about a thing or two. So going 1.5 days of casual use without charging is doable. The only real downside is that the phone doesn’t utilize quick charging. I suppose you’ll rarely need it with a battery this size but most people these days have power anxiety whenever they see a phone with less than 50%. Granted for the Honor 5x 50% will last at least another half day it’s oddly comforting to know that the phone is floating around 80-100% power.BLOATWEARMy biggest and only real complaint about this phone is Huawei’s Launcher EMUI. It’s heavy and full of apps and junk I prefer not to have. It’s as if Huawei was targeting price conscious iPhone users who would be willing to make the switch. It’s not a deal breaker for me as I know someone will eventually find a way to load pure Android onto the phone. In the meantime I would RECOMMEND anybody who purchases this to download the Google Now Launcher or any other launcher. This won't completely mask the Huawei's feature but it'll make the phone more manageable. I have yet to experience any significant lag with the Google Now Launcher with this phone.RECOMMENDATIONS1. Would I recommend this phone?  Most definitely2. Would I recommend it to everybody?  Probably not. If you’re coming from a faster flagship phone I would tell you to keep your phone.3. Who is this phone for?  This phone is an easy upgrade for any android user who hasn’t upgraded their phone in the last year. Those who are okay with having a second or third tiered phone. Those who are looking for the ‘bang for their buck’. The Huawei Honor 5x is a game changer in terms of value.[...] Thank you!,1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWR0,Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone 16GB…,        513 of 544 people found the following review helpful       Best phone for $200 but not perfect. My whole family has one now.  Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!  February 22  2016By Adrian B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I want to start off by saying I have owned a wide variety of phones and this phone has the fewest bugs on its release date that I have ever dealt with. I have a lot of respect for how quick Huawei has been releasing security patches and Enhancement updates. Huawei has also promised to release Marshmallow and EMUI4 in the near future. The day the phone was released Huawei pushed out a security patch. Huawei is also in the process of pushing out an Enhancements software update that includes Android security patch level for January 2016 Updated honor icons and Additional enhancements (Firmware Version KIW-L24C567B140). More information can be found Club Hihonor forums.  Not to mention that the phone has only been release for a month from the time of this review. Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!Update: 24 hours after writing the review the update was released.Before I get into the actual review I would like to add that Huawei is asking for customer feedback and suggestions that will help improve device experience for future updates. Please do a goole search for club hihonor to register and provide feedback.  It is very important to provide this feedback so that we can continue to receive these updates. I was unable to provide links as Amazon has blocked the links.Pros:- Price - Hands down the best phone you can buy at 200.- Build Quality - Not the best but not the worst either. It does not feel cheap in the hands.- Quick OTA Updates - Honor does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.- Fingerprint Reader - Sensor location Speed and accuracy are just perfect.- 1080P IPS Display - At 401 ppi this screen is big and clear. Accurate colors. iPhones also use IPS displays over amoled.- Battery Life - I am heavy user and easily get a full day out this phone. I can get 5-6 hours of screen on time. Very pleased with battery life.- Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Flash also works very well.- SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps photos and videos will all install to SD card.- Dual sim - Not something I will ever use but it’s there.- Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. They are loud and perfect for ringtones and notification but not good at high volume for music. They server their purpose and serve it well.- EMUI Launcher - While a bit sluggish at the moment they have done very well with the ease of use of the launcher. Everything is though out very well. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.- Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Read below for more details on my favorites and least favorite.Cons:- No NFC - This was not an issue for me. Out of the 30 other phones I owned that had NFC I maybe used it 5 times. This may or may not be important to you.- Sluggish Launcher - At this time the launcher is a bit sluggish. This will most likely be resolved in a future update. The phone is fast don’t get me wrong but multitasking button is slow and some apps will sometimes hang but not for long.- No app drawer - I can adapt well to either launcher. If you hate it then install a 3rd party launcher. That is the beauty of android. However it would be nice if they included an option for both.- No headphone included - Im not complaining for 200 bucks I see why they didn’t include them but just so people are aware I thought I would mention it.- Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging and can cut down charge times in half.Wifi - One thing I want to mention right of the bat is the phone does not support 5GHz. However is this really a bad thing like some people have mentioned? Personally I don’t think so and the reason being that 5GHz has a shorter range then 2.4GHz by far. 2.4GHz is still plenty fast but yes has more interferences then 5GHz but I personally have not had an issues with interference. Microwaves and cordless phones are the two number one major interferences on 2.4GHz but who really uses cordless phones now days?  I have a AC router that supports both 5GHz and 2.4GHz and all my devices are connected via 2.4Ghz due to the range limitation that 5GHz has. I cannot use my phone outside with 5GHz connection I have to be indoors. With 2.4 Ghz I can be at the neighbors and still get a solid connection to my wifi. Would it have been nice to have both? Sure it would but you may find your self never using it like I do. Yes there are people out there that could benefit from it in highly populated areas where interference is an issue but this should not be a deal breaker.Price/Build Quality - At 200 dollars the phone is an absolute beast! The build quality is very nice and feels very expensive in the hand. However I would strongly recommend getting a clear silicon case to protect your investment as well as a glass screen protector as the metal back cover can scratch easily on your keys. The back cover has a plastic band on the top and bottom so the back cover is not completely metal.OTA Updates- Huawei is pushing out updates faster than any other company I have dealt with excluding the Nexus line of phones. Huawei does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.Fingerprint Reader - The reader works perfect. The location is absolutely perfect and feels natural in the hand. I’m certain that Apple and Samsung will soon copy the sensor location. Other phones like the iPhone and Galaxy phone that have the reader on the home button are very awkward to use. Your finger naturally rests where the sensor is located so unlocking from the pocket is a pleasure. Galaxy phones have issues with detecting your print at time. This phone works nearly every time and under 1-2 seconds. This was not something I expected from a 200 dollar phone. My only complaint is that at the moment you can only registers 5 different prints. Why do you need more you may ask? The software in EMUI allows you to open up certain apps or call a contact with an assigned print. Both mine and my wife’s prints are on my kids phones so now they are limited to only 3 prints they can use to unlock the phone and use as shortcuts.1080P IPS Display - The 5.5 Inch 401 PPI 1080p IPS display is perfect. The screen is very detailed and colors are natural and accurate. However if you are coming from a amoled display and like bright vivid colors that amoled offers you may not like this screen right away but you will definitely get used to it. This is more of a personal preference. Touch responsiveness is perfect even with a glass screen protector. The screen gets very bright outdoors and so far I have no complaints about the screen what so ever. Watching YouTube videos and viewing pictures has been a pleasure.Battery Life - The phone has a 3000 mAh battery. This is probably the best feature the phone has to offer. I’m a very heavy user and have not owned a phone that can get me through a full day. I’ve had to resort to a external power supply that I took everywhere. I no longer have to carry around the extra power supply with this phone and can easily get 5-6 hours of screen on time. I owned a Oppo Find 7a and loved it because of the large 5.5 inch screen. The downside was the battery life but the phone had quick charging and sort of made up for it. However with this phone the quick charging is not needed as it will get you through the whole day. My wife that is not a heavy user can go two days without a charge. The phone actually uses the more expensive Lithium Polymer (Lipo) vs Lithium Ion battery.Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Other phones that I have owned and compared to have to use flash to get a decent picture under low light. This phone did not have to use the flash to get a decent picture under low light settings. The shutter is very fast and so far has taken less blurry photos than 95% of all the phones that I have owned excluding the Galaxy S6 iPhone 6s and LGG4 (all flash ship phones of course). My daughter is 13 years old and her whole life is around social media and picture taking. She chose the Honor 5x over the Galaxy S6 mainly because of battery life and the location of the figure print scanner. She used both phones for a few days and said she could barely tell the different in the photos. I personally can see that the photos on the Galaxy S6 were way better but to a 13 year old kid they would prefer battery life and a bigger screen over better photos and faster phone. She was unable to tell Galaxy S6 had better camera Processor and screen then the Honor 5x. I then sold the Galaxy s6 and purchased 3 more Honor 5x's for all my kids for the price of one Galaxy S6.SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps photos and videos will all install to SD card. Other phones I have owned had an SD card slot but would only allow you to use it for photos and videos. It would not install app on the SD card like the Honor 5x does. I purchased a 32gb SD card and have installed a ton of games apps photos and videos on the SD card without any issues. Simply go into settings>Storage and change default location to SD Card.Dual sim - Not something I will probably ever use but its there. You have an option for a Micro sim card and nano sim card. This would be very useful if you own a business and need two lines. One for personal calls and other for business.Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. If you compare to Galaxy S6 or HTC speakers then yes they suck. However if you are comparing to 95% of the speakers on the market they are loud and perfect for ringtones notifications and videos. They are not very good for music at high volumes but I don’t know a lot of people that listen to music from there tiny little phone speaker. Most of us have Bluetooth speakers for that. The speakers serve there purpose and serve it well for a 200 dollar phone. Even more expensive phones have a worse speakers then the Honor 5x.Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging so if you have a 2A charger on hand you can cut the charge time in half. 2A charging is also a verified feature on the Honor 5x website so it is perfectly safe to use a 2A charger. Again they most likely sent a 1A vs 2A charger to cut back on cost.Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Out of the three the black with dark gray back was my favorite. One thing I noticed right away with the White and Gold model is the black border around the LCD. The black model still has the black border but because the front bezel is also black the border was hidden. I have taken pictures side by side so you can see what im talking about. The white was my 2nd favorite and probably would have been my first pick had they done a better job tucking in the LCD border behind the bezel. As for the gold model I did not like it at all. It does not even appear gold and at times looks like a rose gold on the back cover. The front looks more like a copper color than gold. It not horrible or unbearable but it was just the least favorite out of the three for me but my son loves it so thats all that matters.EMUI Launcher/OS - Launchers are a big subject for me because I have dealt with some crappy launchers such as Touchwiz for the Galaxy phones and ColorOS for Oppo phones. EMUI reminds me a lot of ColorOS however the EMUI 3.1 launcher was thought out very well and works way better. I didn’t like that the app drawer was gone it reminded me to much of iOS but quickly got used to it. The OS is still a bit sluggish at the moment taking some apps 1-2 seconds to open at times but I have confidence that Honor will resolve this very soon as this is more of an optimization of the OS vs and launcher issue. The processor is definitely capable of providing a smooth experience it just needs to be optimized so I hope they work on this first. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.Overall I am very happy with this phone. Not only because it was cheap but because it was very well designed and built. Nothing feels cheap about this phone. I have paid 300 more for phones that I was not happy with. Honor has definitely raised the bar for budgets phones pressing other companies to follow the trend. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a better than average phone on a budget.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: Since the recent update KIW-L24C567B140 the phone performs very well now.  However there are two settings that greatly effected performance. When enabling Guest Mode via Settings>Security>Privacy Protection from phone settings menu the phone takes a major performance hit. Apps would hang at times 10 secs or more to open up the camera shutter button and icons were missing from home screen and slowly start to appear. However once Guest Mode/Privacy Protection was turned off the phone performed very well. Changing power saving mode from Smart (Factory Default) to Normal also increased performance via Settings>Power Saving. I still also got a full days worth of battery life! I hope that an update will resolve this.Tips:Move multiple icons at once - I took me a while to realize that this was possible but from your home screen you can pinch the screen to bring up the Home Page setting options. You can add wallpapers Widgets change page transitions effects and access the More Settings page to change home page settings. Once you have pinched the screen can start to select the icons you wish to move. You will see a blue check mark on the icons you wan to move. Once you are read to move the icons long hold on any one of the blue checked apps you have selected and move the icons. However folders are limited to 30 apps :-(Guest Mode - Pretty cool feature but as stated above this feature really effected the performance of the phone. To enable go to Settings>Security>Privacy Protection and click Lets Start. Enter your main pass code and press next. This should bring you to the Owners Fingerprint screen do nothing here but press next. You will then be prompted to enter a guest pass code enter a pass code different from your main pass code. You should now be a the Guest Fingerprint screen from here you can add a new print or assign an existing print for guest mode. You should now be at the Privacy Protection screen main menu where you can now hide contact photo albums and hide certain application from the quest account.Notification no longer working? - Ok so EMUI OS will not allow apps to run in the background unless you say otherwise a feature I actually enjoy this may be why the battery life is so good. This will prevent apps like Facebook Ebay Facebook Messenger Spotify YouMail Netflix and Dropbox from working correctly and will also prevent push notifications. Example: Spotify and Netflixs will enable a quick menu on your lock screen and notification bar to pause play and forward music or movies. However if you do not allow the app to run in the background the app will close out once you lock your screen. Another example if Facebook. If someone messages you or if you get an update on Facebook your phone will not notify you until you allow it run in the back ground. If you are having issue with any app try this first. Go to Settings>Protected Apps> and enable all the apps you wish to receive real time notification and any app you wish to run in the background.Tired of the Power Consumption Prompt? I got sick of being reminded that certain apps were consuming a lot of power. To disable the prompts go to Settings>Power Saving>Settings and disable Power intensive prompt.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWR0,Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone 16GB…,        382 of 408 people found the following review helpful       Both devices has been selling really good on amazon with similar price range and great sales ...  February 2  2016By Bbta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The phone can be looked at from two different aspect. A budget phone that costs $200 and a ""flagship killer"". I give it 5 stars for the former and 4 stars for the later. I am a nexus fan own Nexus 4 5 7 9 so you can see I will definitely not be biased against it in any way. And I am coming from an LG G2.I bought this for me and nexus 6 for my wife both around the same time. Nexus 6 being last season's flagship phone and a phone that still tops many charts in performance will be my frame of reference here. Both devices has been selling really good on amazon with similar price range and great sales recently. So here it goes. Which device you should get?Motorola Nexus 6 vs Huawei Honor 5XPackage accessories and boxingBoth come with neat boxes but nothing fancy. Both come with warranty and manuals (despite some reviews mentioning the honor 5 coming without them) and sim ejection tool. the big difference here being the charger. The honor device comes with extremely generic charger pretty slow at that too (1 amp although it performs at slower rate than other similarly advertised ones). The Motorola device comes with quick charger (2 amps goes from 10% to 100% in about 70 min compared to 2.5-3 hours). Also note that it is much much easier to find third party accessories for the nexus 6 on amazon and elsewhere (it has been around for longer after all)Winner: Nexus 6Set upBoth are android devices so a lot is common here. Both take advantage of the back up / restore function from google pretty well. Surprisingly boot up and restoring apps and settings from the honor was faster by a good margin than the nexus 6 (35 min vs 50 mins). This has to do with the multiple updates the nexus 6 has to do before you reach the Android 6.0.1 it is supposed to reach. My honor came with Android 5.1.1 out of box. Restart time for the Honor was also surprisingly better than the nexus by few seconds. I would have to given this to the honor 5xWinner: Honor 5xProcessor RAM and PerformanceLooking merely at numbers nexus 6 wins hands down. Snapdragon 805 3 GB RAM Adreno 420 GPU and pure Android experience. This translates into a very buttery performance. This thing is a beast! no lags whatsoever. It goes through apps with not even the slightest hiccup. 3D games looks amazing there. Although you may see benchmark tests slightly higher for other flagships from this year I highly doubt you could observe the difference with naked eye.The Honor 5X is mid range at best compared to that. Snapdragon 615 2 GB of RAM are no match to that beats of a device. However and this is a big however since you are looking in this price range I assume you are looking for day to day device not a gaming moster. The honor X5 is plenty adequate for that. You may see the occasional hiccups here or there (so far mostly with Google Play Store) but this is by no means an issue.Overall the Nexus performed better. However being a flagship device and a nexus device this is expected. The pleasant surprise was the Honor 5x despite having an inferior CPU GPU and RAMS and a heavier EMUI skin still performs very close to the nexus. I will have to give this one to the Honor because of that.One downside I did not like in the Honor 5x is the lack of dual band WiFi. Now unless you have an internet line with speeds exceeding 10-15 M you should be fine.On downside in the nexus 6 was the lack of an LED light for notifications. It is there as a hardware but you will have to root your device to control it. Not cool.The killer addition on the honor was the finger print scanner. Spot on and no different in performance than what you find in Apple devices or the higher end nexus 6p. Kudos!Honor 5x also has some nice features I missed from my LG G2 like tapping screen twice to wake up and flipping phone to mute alarm or ring. Those are missing from the Nexus 6.Winner: Honor 5xBatteryThe honor 5x seems to take the edge clearly here as well. Despite having the EMUI skin and the older android version I managed to get about 6-7 hours of screen on time. This is was only 3-4 on the nexus 6. Sure the nexus battery is larger but the higher pixel and stronger CPU are much more power hungry.Winner: Honor 5xDesign and qualityHonor 5x wins here as well. Metal build is no means a $600 apple iphone but is a nice tough and looks sturdier than the plastic covered nexus 6. Both are nice but the honor 5x is more likely to be mistaken for a $600 device than the nexus. Also I did not like the curved back on the nexus. It CAN NOT stay still on its back very annoying if you try to open the device or text while on the desk or ground for example.Winner: Honor 5xSoftwareI am a nexus fan so here pure android like it is meant to be is the winner. Do not get me wrong though EMUI is much less troublesome than I expected and has some nice features.Winner: Nexus 6DisplayOn paper the nexus 6 wins. More pixels larger and better coating (Corning Gorilla Glass 3 lacking in Honor 5x). However the screen colors were by no means as lively as the ones on the Honor 5x. I think it is a tie.Winner: Tie.Value for MoneyAround back Friday the nexus 6 was selling for $200. Recently it was around $250. Around that price I would have given the edge to the it. But It its current price ($350) the Honor 5x wins.Winner: 5xCameraBoth cameras are pretty comparable. The Honor 5x default app has more features but this is android! You can just download any app/feature at the touch of a bottom. Both have lacking cameras in poorly let environments. I think the Honor 5x has a slight advantage but overall I would call it a tie.Winner: TieOverall being a hardcore nexus fan I find it very hard to say but the Honor 5x has my vote. Huwaei seemed to have found it is way to the use market with just the right combination of performance price and features. Cannot wait to get their Nexus 6p which based on what I saw in this Honor device should be a incredible!",1

I wanted them to have updated phones with decent specs and im glad I made this move.PROS: Price - $200Screen - 1080P LCD Goodness that is very vibrant and bright.Materials - A nice metal build that looks premium and feels good in the hand not as good as HTC?Camera - very good performer for $200  perfect for social media.Speaker - pretty loud for ringtones and mediocre for listening to music.Battery - 3000 mAh  enough for a day of normal use!Finger print scanner works very fluidCons - The phones would lag if I started to do heavy multitasking which included the opening of more than 4+ apps  and trying to move through the phone really fast.  This is quite normal since we are dealing with a mid range CPU and 2GB ram.Overall the speed is quite sufficient if you aren't speeding through the phone.Misc - Some people may not enjoy the EMUI interface but I found it very nice!  it was a breath of fresh air to experience versus the other major players' skins in the Android market,0

With each new iteration they get better and more affordable. The Honor 5X is no exception. I have the Nexus 6P Galaxy S6 Edge + and the Moto X Pure Edition (2015). Although it is not as powerful as these phones it is still a great phone for the price. The fingerprint sensor works perfect. I love being able to us the sensor to go back to my home page take pics and check notifications. The phone is fast but it does lag a little bit. However that should be expected. It doesn't have a high end processor. However the minor hiccups can easily be overlooked by the sheer beauty and overall performance. Get this phone and you will not regret it!,0

March 18  2016By ca8050,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I will first tell you that I'm a compulsive perfectionist who is very difficult to totally please but this phone is a pure BOMB!!!  I'm very very pleased with it.  Is it ""perfect"" NO but it's far superior to the $500+ phones that AT&T sell and there is no bloatware on it.  All of the AT&T apps on my Play Store list I just hit the ""X"" in the top right corner...and doing that felt really good.The app's provided by Huawei for email music video are far better than anything you can find it the Google Play Store.Double tap to wake up and provided Screen Lock app to turn off are very convenient.Any apps that I didn't want and could not delete I just disabled.Things that I consider suggestions for improvement...1.  it's sometimes a bit slow to redraw the screens but so what.2.. the WiFi is not dual-band; it's 2.4GHz only.3. not crazy about the default launcher because there is no way to hide/remove apps that you do not want on your desktop so you have to create a ""crap app folder"".  To solve this I just applied the Google Now launcher which works perfectly...4.  without installing a 3rd party glass screen phone gets way too many fingerprints5.  without using protective case phone is too slippery to handle and the power button in located right where you grip the phone.  I would like to see the power button relocated to the top of the case.6.  would like the 3 navigation buttons to be part of the phone hardware not the android OS.  these buttons rotate with the screen which is a sometimes little awkward and confusing.7.  when charging phone displays a green light...i would like to see it red when charging and to turn green when fully charged.8.  phone is slightly too big and too heavy...smaller and lighter would be better for my taste.If Huawei offers a phone exactly like this one only with more RAM a faster processor 5GHz WiFi and a little smaller screen would be nice but not if not still OK count me in!  I'll buy it immediately but until they do this phone is still tops on my list.Am I satisfied with this phone = YESDo I recommend it = YESWould I purchase it again = YES",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWR0,Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone 16GB…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Worth the Money  May Have Gripes if You Are Coming From a Higher End Phone Due to Slowdowns  January 28  2017By Ming W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I got this Honor 5x phone for use on my T-Mobile account.  For people that are considering this phone I want to emphasize that my review is based upon the experience of having used a Coolpad Rouge prior to this.  If you are not familiar with this phone it may be due to the fact that it is T-Mobile’s lowest priced SMARTPHONE (not a flip-phone) and one of the most economically priced out there period.  And I got what I paid for ($10 special at Bestbuy) slow to the point that I press on the screen a second time thinking that the system didn’t register the first press when in actuality it doesn’t process fast enough and when it finally catches up the second press will inadvertently open/close a page.  The screen resolution is low I squint at the screen due to its small size and clicks on the screen are not very precise causing many typing errors.  And logically people that had the experience of a higher priced and quality phone may rate this lower.  Although this is better than what I had  I will attempt to be as objective as possible with regards to the capabilities of this phone.  The bottom line is that with regards to the price it is a solid buy but heavier users beware of slowdowns and heating.  If you found this helpful please let me know!Hardware:  I’m not going to repeat what can be read in the description but this phone is the best bang for the buck as far as hardware is concerned.  Glass screen metal alloy body with a solid weight.  The battery is not removable  (unibody) and thus providing increased protection from water damage.  It is a nice size as well with a 5.5” screen.  There is also a fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone or apps and from what I’ve read is harder to find at this pricepoint.  Definite pluses in this area; this phone feels and looks like a phone that costs more. Its thin and sleek as well.  The camera takes great pics and has a variety of features.  Ultra sharp and clear. It includes various modes (food beauty selfie etc) and various filter effects (vintage mono etc) images of various sizes HDR/slow mo recording and even “all-focus” to achieve the best quality picture.  This is a Dual SIM phone for heavy users.  The phone comes with a pointy key tool to pop out the SIM and micro-sd card compartments and was easy to use.User-Interface/Processing Speed:  I had to return the first phone that I got due to constant overheating; to the point where the back of the phone is very warm 70%  of the time.  And of course this slows the phone down dramatically.  I got a replacement which didn’t overheat as much with the same amount of data used.  The phone can get warm to the touch and slow down with multiple apps running esp video watching  download/uploading simultaneously. Possibly due to only having 2GB if RAM.  I am only using 30% of internal memory storage and roughly 20% of my external sd card and 40% of the time it warms up after 20 min of continual usage esp with a phone case.  Not always a slowdown until I play videos with other apps running or dl/upload  while browsing.  The phone’s internal ROM is 16GB which should be the minimum for a medium smartphone user.  But it is generally acceptable.  Huawei has its EMUI user-interface which is simplistic and fairly streamlined.  The downside is that it constantly tries to revert customizations or 3rd party apps back to the stock EMUI interface.  For example I installed Arrow Launcher from Microsoft (the stock launcher and icons are unimpressive) and when I restart the phone it will revert back to stock.  For people that are used to a “faster” phone the slowdowns will be a deal killer.Apps/Features:  The fingerprint reader works but not efficient or precise enough for me to use as the method to unlock the phone.  I find that it takes a few tries of pressing my index finger into the reader to get it to register.  One neat feature is the storage cleaner to maintain faster processing speed; with the press of a button it will clear out the cache and even app memory (reverting apps back to pre-update status) in both internal and external memory locations.  I find it very convenient.  Bloatware isn’t really an issue there are a few apps preloaded (sound recorder EMUI marketplace) and could be useful.Battery Life:  It's pretty good but then again I've only had it for less than a month.  So far so good esp since its a 5.5"" screen.  I keep my screen at the brightest setting and I can get through the day without plugging it in with moderate/heavy use. To give a better idea  I've been having a voice recorder and LTE Discovery running in the background all day and I have enough juice to last from 8am to 10pm withou plugging in.  The charging wall adapter IS NOT 2.1 A and can be painstakingly slow to recharge.  And the micro usb cable that comes with this is short… around 3 ft.  First accesorry I got was a fast charging plug 2.1a usb port and 6 ft micro usb cable.I felt that this phone was worth the under $160 price-point but for those that have used higher end phones the existence of slower processing and heating will be a point of frustration.  I would purchase again if I had to do it over due to great hardware and tolerable functioning speed.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWR0,Honor 5X Unlocked Smartphone 16GB…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       The Honor 5X is a great smartphone  budget or no. If you need a smartphone  this should filter to the top of your list.  February 8  2016By Larry A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This phone is a budget phenomenon. It packs in loads of features at a very affordable price. I bought three at launch and have not been disappointed.Hardware:  Good quality metal body housing a big and bright screen. The blacks are not as dark as one would like but still looks good. The expandable micro SD slot loaded in an old card well. Be aware that this phone prefers the high-speed card so if you're looking make sure to filter to that. The phone is 5.5"" and coming from a 4.7"" Moto X (1st gen) I'm still adjusting to the size.  The metal body is slippery so I'm currently searching for a good case.Software:  Huawei's Emotion User Interface (EMUI) is rather snappy. It zips around from app to app in a rather quick manner. There are times when the app stalls as if to think about what to do but it's rare and often quickly remedied.  My largest gripe is that free RAM is often much lower than the 2 GB limit.  I'm often at less than 1GB of free RAM and I just feel as if the phone is inefficient.  The absence of an app drawer is also missed. Users are relegated to creating folders and accessing all apps from there. It took me an entire week to customize but my phone is finally where I want it to be.Phone Reception:  The phone speaker is indeed rather hard to hear out of sometimes. It's not my network either. When using a bluetooth headset the calls are clear.  I'm using T-mobile moving over from Sprint and I miss Sprint's HD voice to other Sprint users. This is a network issue and unrelated to the phone itself.Other media features like FM Radio Recorders and video playback etc.. are all top notch.  The phone is an uncompromising offer. The fingerprint scanner is the most underrated feature. I thought I'd barely use it but I hate entering a password now.  You can store up to five fingerprints so you can unlock the phone in either hand or by other people.  You can even lock e-commerce app transactions behind a fingerprint scan.  I confidently recommend this phone.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01LZ8516T,ASUS ZenFone 3 MAX ZC520TL Smartphone…,        206 of 225 people found the following review helpful       Good AT&T LTE Midrange Camera Phone Value  but Beware Firmware Updates and Support  October 20  2016By Darren,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased the USA warranty/spec version of the Zenfone 3 Laser ZC551KL as a replacement to an old Samsung Galaxy Note II and a Blu R1 HD that had a substandard camera.  Basically I wanted something no larger than the Note II preferably a little smaller and thinner.  I also preferred to keep the micro SD and micro SIM features so I can switch phones easily.  Finally I wanted a phone with at least a decent camera and Android 6 priced at $200 or less (off contract) so I can avoid lease fees and carrier surcharges.  Most importantly I wanted full AT&T USA LTE coverage including band 17.  This is one of very few phones that fit my requirements.  Note that Amazon has combined all versions of the Zenfone 3 into the same review listings.  This review is for the 5.5"" 2GB/32GB Laser version with USA warranty.Pros:Reasonably compact and slim for a 5.5"" screen.  At under $200 I don't even need to buy a case that adds bulk.  With only a screen protector it's very thin and fits nicely in a pocket and in my hand a bit smaller than the Note II overall.  If it breaks it's not so expensive to replace like a flagship phone would be.  The case is aluminum alloy according to Asus though it feels more like plastic.Display.  The screen is very bright at maximum settings and colors seem fairly vivid.  It only has full HD (1920x1080) but that's still very reasonable for a midrange $200 phone.  The viewing angles aren't as good as some top-of-the-line phones but you never even notice this unless your're sharing a video on a tabletop or something like that.  The auto-dim feature works well and you can adjust the baseline brightness for use with the automatic sensor too.  You can disable automatic to make it quite visible even in sunlight.Camera.  So far very good pictures and video.  Very impressive for a midrange model.  No issues focusing near or far and no problems with choppy video like my R1 HD.  My only complaint is that it won't allow for smaller image sizes.  Many times for online publishing I'd like to take 1920x1080 FHD images and not have to resize later.  I'm sure a third party app would resolve this so it's not a big deal.  It does have Sony imaging hardware and focusing is fast and accurate with short shutter delay so I haven't missed any photos so far due to blurriness or shutter lag.  Included is one example with good daylight plus one in a dark room using flash.  This isn't going to be a high end camera like on an iPhone Galaxy or other flagship smartphone but for the money I've been impressed.Full AT&T USA LTE compatibility.  Amazon didn't list LTE bands at the time of my purchase.  The Asus North America website only listed specs for the Japanese spec phone not the USA warranty version.  Asus Global correctly lists the USA spec phone bands and I confirmed these with Asus tech support: 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 17 28.  I have personally confirmed bands 2 4 and 17 with the latter perhaps being the most important one in areas that use it.  Note that it appears to lack band 12 which is the T-Mobile equivalent of band 17 so I can't comment on interoperability or compatibility for other networks.  So far I have had no issues with wi-fi or cellular data speeds on AT&T in the Chicago area.  If you are on T-Mobile the $149 Blue Life One X2 has similar specs and has band 12.  PLEASE NOTE: Most international versions of the Zenfone 3 DO NOT have the most important LTE bands for either AT&T or T-Mobile.  You must get the USA version for full LTE coverage on AT&T!Fingerprint scanner.  I haven't had one on my previous phones.  This is a great feature not only for security but also for ease of unlocking the phone.  It works very fast my home page appears in a fraction of a second every time.  You can also use a pin or swipe if you wish.  I appreciate the sensor on the back of the phone so it's very easy to unlock with one hand using your index finger.Dedicated back/home/apps bottom buttons.  I greatly prefer these to software buttons like on the Blu R1 HD.Reasonable power.  The Snapdragon 430 Adreno 505 and 2GB RAM seem much snappier than the R1 HD.  I've had very few issues with performance so far even after almost a month of use with all my apps installed.  I don't use my phone for gaming so it might not be a great performer for intensive apps but it works fine for browsing email Google apps and other typical apps.  My only complaint is that Asus should have included 4GB of memory like in other global markets.  I've had slowdowns when uploading media to Facebook that are resolved by clearing the memory with the Power & Boost android utility.  I usually average 1.5GB of 1.8GB free and I've made some efforts to prevent unnecessary stuff from loading.  So even 3GB would have made this a 5-star rating.Battery life.  Seems fine for a modest day of use.  I have no measurements but it seems to be as good or better than my other phones.  With brightness on automatic at the lowest base setting and airplane mode active I used it constantly on a 3 hour plane trip and ended up with 90% remaining.  I wish the battery was removable but the case cannot be opened easily.Quality.  The build fit finish and appearance are very good for the price.  Looks sharp.  The buttons on the side have nice tactile feel and work well.  Camera lens bulge is minimal.  So far no issues with excessive heat though it does get a little warm with extended video streaming.Android Marshmallow.  Seems like a fairly clean interface and works nicely so far.  No issues at all with reboots crashes and only minor issues sometimes when writing messages in facebook especially when uploading images or photos.Works right away.  Unlike my son's Zenfone 2 this one picked up network settings automatically so we didn't have to deal with figuring out how to resolve issues with data and MMS operation.  With Google backup and the Android Google ""Set Up Nearby Device"" utility everything copied over with minimal hassle.Micro SD card compatibility.  I have over 4000 songs and various other files and data on my SD card.  It's nice to be able to simply move it over to a new phone and go.  I've had no issues with playing music or finding files so far.  I am generally using Amazon Music for local music files and the Sirius XM app.Call quality.  So far so good.  Plus I get reception in my basement  My Galaxy Note II also did but the Blu R1 HD was hit or miss for calls and data.Amazon.  Great service as always.  Offered free next day shipping for Prime in my area.Cons:Updates and Support: Thanksgiving Day Asus pushed a firmware update that caused all affected units to no longer recognize their SIM cards.  The phones could not receive any cellular calls texts or data.  Despite numerous reports they told owners there was no possibility to roll back the firmware and that phones must be sent in for RMA repairs.  After 3 days they finally posted a firmware roll back on their website and forums that resolved the issue.Memory.  2GB is really barely sufficient for a midrange phone.  Global versions appear to have 4GB.  This one should have had at least 3GB.Color.  Honestly I wish it came in black gray or blue.  I have the silver which is fine and on the plus side matches my Lenovo Yoga 900S notebook.Bloatware.  Reasonable amount of junk apps that I will never use and cannot be easily uninstalled.  I could do without ZenUI and almost all of these useless apps.  Considering the marginal 2GB of memory any stuff that can be removed so it is never loaded is a benefit.The headphone volume isn't as loud as I'd like.  Call volume speakerphone volume and bluetooth audio volume in my car all seem to be good though.Lacks Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 though the chipset supports it.  Charging times seem typical.Conclusion:This is not a flagship phone and it's not even comparable to other Zenfone 3 models.  Those all cost $400 to $800 off-contract and offer a lot more features.  This is a midrange phone and a good one.  I give it 4 stars for a $200 unlocked Android 6 phone with full AT&T LTE compatibility.  The poor support and minimal 2GB of memory keeping it from a full 5-stars at this price.  Many inexpensive phones do not include the all the essential AT&T bands which may not be an issue in some areas but will be in others.  In particular band 17 is absent on many budget models but is included on the USA spec Zenfone 3 models.  The display camera and fingerprint sensor are standout features at this price point.  The main competition right now in the USA seems to be the slightly smaller 5.2"" Blu Life One X2 which has a similar feature set and is somewhat less expensive at $149.  The $199 version as more RAM and storage and might be a good alternative.  The Blu Vivo 5R and Moto G4 Play are also similar with slightly less powerful processors and cameras.",1

January 4  2017By Waukesha04,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Last summer I broke my Samsung Galaxy S5. At that time I bought a BLU Advanced 5.0 for $59.00 (Terrible phone). I needed an upgrade but I didn't want to get stuck in AT&T monthly purchase plan for a new phone. I did some research and saw this phone. I have been a fan of ASUS Computers. I ordered it through Prime at 8 pm. It came by noon the next day! I love you Amazon!. Anyways the phone was impressive right out the the box. It looks so sleek and thin. In the box; Charger phone SIM card tool and instructions in a few languages. I stuck my AT&T SIM card and my MicroSD card in and fired it up. I am not a tech expert. It walks you through set up so nicely when you get started. Within 5 mins I had a fully set up phone. It even will install apps from your old phone automatically if you wish (I have no idea if that is common but its nice).  The phone is responsive and fast. The touch screen is sensitive in a good way. I love the fingerprint unlocking feature. It also lets you set up other apps to have it log in with your fingerprint. I was able to set up my banking app login in with a fingerprint (instead of my normal password) How cool is that!? The camera seems good so far. I just snapped a few pics around the house. It does focus and snap very quickly. The Screen is bigger than I expected when I ordered it. It looks really nice.  There are a few ASUS apps that I can't imaging wanting that come on the phone but not a big deal. The ASUS User Interface seems simple and logical.  Overall for $200 the phone is a great alternative to walking into a store and laying down $600. I also think its better than buying a used/refurbished phone.,0

(12-14 hours heavy usage)Easy to setup from old phone.Camera is good.Opens apps fast.Screen is clear and bright.Call quality is good.Text Facebook Outlook email works exactly the same.Finger print scanner works great.Cons:No lights on the home button.Limited accessories.Lots of preloaded ASUS apps but some are very useful and hasn't slowed down performance.Very well made fast as advertised and great alternative to flagship phones that cost 2x or 3x the cost.  This family will probably never buy a phone from a cellular carrier again.,0

December 30  2016By Mehkailovich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great phone! The phone was created to compete with the top phones such as the S7 and Pixel and in my opinion it does it quite well! It looks great and like most phones the performance is not lacking but where it really shines is the camera! I was able to compare with friends taking pictures in various settings such as snowboarding and this one shines with its optical image stabilization and laser focus.,0

A+  January 17  2017By Mark Lilly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought this phone to replace my firephone that crashed. I was intrigued with the specs on this phone. My wife has a Samsung S7. The specs are very close. Asus has 3.5 gig memory Samsung has 3 gig. They both use android 6.0 marshmallow OS. Cameras are very similar. Asus  does not have wireless charging. Asus has a bigger screen. Other than those differences they are basically the same with a much lower price tag. Storage is the same. I like my new phone very much. I think I got a great deal at under $400. I bought an amazon deals item which was $40 less without the box. Perfect condition.,0

December 12  2016By John E.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is for the MAX not the 5.5 laserPros:4100mAh - reason I bought this phoneVery long battery life even with wifi and apps running.Decent price for what you get feels solid in terms of build.Screen is very vibrant no issues with the quality(even if it isn't 1080)Finger print scanner work wellSurprisingly snappy for a budget phone with 2GB of ramPhone can also charge other devices with it's dongleDecent camera both front and backComes with a 2.0 Amp charger(more of on FYI than a pro)Cons:I knew these features were missing prior to buying the phone that is why I am not taking off any eggs-No gorilla glass-Apparently no fast charging but I haven't had any issues with power given the large battery-Not 1920x1080 screen I hear that there is a version of this phone out there with one but can't find it on sale anywhere-CPU is a little underpowered however this is to extend battery life. So far aside from the initial out of the box set up I haven't had any speed issues-roughly 6.8GB left free on the phone itself after OS + updates it will take an SD card so for me the free space is enough-Blutooth seems to drain battery faster than other things might be fixed in a firmware update(?)-Asus android updates are slow but that is the company thing not the phoneSide notes:This is a BUDGET phone with a focus on BATTERY LIFE. If you aren't looking for one of those two things when considering this phone please don't rate the phone low because you didn't understand the market it is targeting. I travel a lot for work and I got tired of carrying around a spare battery or a usb charger so far this battery is lasting far longer than anything prior I have owned. I wouldn't buy this if I was going to focus on gaming or powerful apps spend the 30-50 dollars and get the Laser or a Honor 5x for a good mid range phone. This is by no means a power users if you want a powerful flagship phone obviously you won't find it for <150. If you are looking for a good phone focused on long battery life even with wifi and other things running this is a great phone for you.,0

July 12  2015By BOBBY,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I ordered an unlocked AT&T 4g LTE Samsung s5. It was Delivered on time. I was able to follow the tracking. Even though it came through USPS (UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE) the phone got to me in 2 days. No shipping charges nor sales tax and I'm not a Prime Member either. The phone was in excellent condition actually it was brand new in a tightly sealed package. The 3.0 charging/syncing cable was included. As well as the charger and ear phones with extra ear buds to change out or replace lost ones. I have Straight Talk and took my sim card out of my HTC ONE VX and placed it in the s5. Installed the battery Turned on phone set up phone and worked great. Battery was at full charge. Only issue not having anything to do with the seller I had to call Straight Talk and get the correct APN settings. I googled the APN settings and everything was correct except a couple of those APN settings. I wasn't able to connect to the internet unless I had wifi. But after getting the correct APN settings from Straight Talk I could connect to the internet without any issues. ***If you do have Straight Talk and you need help with the APN settings it would be best if you called from a different phone. The reason why i say that is because they will not want to help you put in the correct settings. ***The phone has crystal clear videos. No drop calls. Able to hook up to bluetooth devices without any issues. Awesome graphics for games.  Waiting for my 128gb sd card to come in to expand the memory. The S6 does not allow you to remove the battery nor add an micro SD card and that us another reason i chise thjs phone. Wife really likes the phone and she is considering getting one as well. I Watched the youtube video on the water test. The guy had the phone in 3 feet of water for an hour and never stopped working. I put my phone in a 5 gallon bucket of water for 15 minutes and nothing happened. Yeah it would have sucked if i messed it up by doing that but i was confident nothing would happen.  you want a phone that you will enjoy purchase this phone. You want regret it. I first thought about the newest iPhone but I'm glad I got the s5. I was just dissapointed that I didn't order it sooner.,0

I am returning it.  October 4  2015By Joseph M.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn't find out until after it was activated so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won't charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again when it got to 30% I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update the phone was reset while it finished installing that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned 7 hours later it had stopped charging and the phone was charged to 19%.  So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone but after it was trained it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don't know if I should order another one of these phones I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones but they avoid saying that in the description.,0

Honestly I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective dark reflection.- Stunning display. Impressive 5.1 QHD AMOLED display is beautiful and vibrant. It's largely the same as the S6 but that's not a bad thing.- Camera has a great rear camera compared to the S6. Even though the megapixels have been reduced to 12 it has a much better sensor and takes great photos in low-light environments. It auto-focuses super quickly so you can take pictures as quickly as you can pull up the camera app. - 3000mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day. And it comes with the fast Qi charge technology which is charged from 0% to 50% in 30mins only!- Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone. - Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1.5m deep and 30 minutes.  - up to 128Gb Micro SD expandable memoryThe things Samsung have to improve:  - Not removable battery pack. 3000mAh is not enough for a busy day. - No USB-type C so it's not future proof but then again the lifetime of the phone is 1-2 years.- Only 32GB storage. But you can overcome this with micro-SD storage.- Dual sims function: you have to remove the micro-sd card for the sim 2 otherwise there is no any other slot for sim2.  - I am using T-mobile the speed of LTE of the dual sims international version is very not stable and slow than the one I used on my iphone 6s GSM unlocked ver.- For some reason my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My iphone6s had fingerprint readers and its quicker or more accurate than the S7,0

Hence technically most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick light balanced fantastic screen fast water proof and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen but the resolution is the same as with the S7 and its edges are highly annoying making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore the Edge's edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.Finally the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card which is recognized by the device's OS.",0

August 23  2016By Chris1319,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,While I am generally happy with the phone overall I did encounter a MAJOR PROBLEM with Samsung this phone and buying international phones in the domestic USA. The sim tray on the Galaxy S7 is incredibly cheap plastic. It broke in half - with part of the tray stuck INSIDE the SIM assembly on the phone.The Amazon ad clearly designates that there is no warranty. That's helpful to know. However when I contacted Samsung asking for help (i.e. - LET ME PAY YOU TO FIX MY PHONE) I was told that because this was an international phone the domestic Samsung people will not help me.So I'm left right now with a device that I cannot use (that I purchased 3 months ago) because I cannot remove the plastic component that broke inside the phone. This would typically be covered by warranty but there is no warranty on this device. I cannot pay to get it fixed by the manufacturer because they won't touch it.So because of poor support and lack of recourse I really would not recommend anyone go the route of purchasing an international variant Samsung device in the US.,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01CZ41QZG,Samsung Galaxy S7 32 GB Unlocked Phone…, Best phone I have ever had.  February 17  2017By jadeVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had this phone for a little under a week and it is amazing! I love how to operating system works and how beautiful it is. The camera is crisp and clean. This is coming from someone Who obsesses about picture quality on Instagram. It launches quickly whether you double press the home button or click it on the screen. In the time I've had it I haven't had any app problems. The phone itself is quite responsive. I remember reading the reviews and seeing that someone complained that it gets hot when charging and that the box was opened and resealed(mine came sealed). I did notice that the first two instances where I charged my phone it became a pretty warm however I believe it's due to the phone's first charge similar to the phone taking longer to charge the first time you use it. In addition to that I've also noticed that the battery life got better after the first few charges. The fingerprint scanner also works very well comparable to the iphone 6s.Will update if anything changes.,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWXE,Honor 5X unlocked smartphone 16GB…,        1 234 of 1 283 people found the following review helpful       The first ‘real’ budget phone that’s worth the money  February 5  2016By Wilfred,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,OVERVIEWThe Huawei Honor 5x is the first of its kind. It’s not a game changer in terms of the latest and the greatest. It’s a game changer in that it’s the first ‘real’ low cost phone that has a metal body large battery beautiful screen fingerprint reader decent cameras and a decent processor.For the longest time phone makers reserved metal smartphones and fingerprint readers for their ‘flagship’ models. Only those who pay $600+ (un-subsidized) would have the luxury of accessing those new features. The Huawei Honor 5x was designed to disrupt that philosophy.For reference my previous phones were:Nexus 5Oneplus OneOneplus TwoNexus 5xVALUEAt a very low $200 price point at launch the Honor 5x is currently one of the best values in terms of specs features build material and support. To get to that price point Huawei had to cut back on a few things like NFC a faster processor and a camera quality. This may sound like a huge deal breaker and it may as well be if you’re coming from a flagship phone from any other maker but at $200 what the Honor 5x is able to pack into the phone is way better than any other phone in that same price range. (Name a metal high quality phone with a fingerprint reader that can be purchased at $200 at launch day. 02/05/2016)SPEED***Update 02/19/2016 After nearly 20 days using this phone as my primary phone I'm finally ready to comment on the performance. Comparing the Honor 5x with my previous phone the Nexus 5x I would have to say that they seem identical. I actually haven't notice any significant lag on the Honor 5x whereas with my Nexus 5x I've notice significant lag with similar apps. Just as a disclosure I do not play mobile games much so I can't vouch whether this phone would be great for gaming. ***FINGERPRINT READERThe Honor 5x’s fingerprint reader is pretty snappy. I can and probably will say that it’s quicker than the Nexus 5x’s fingerprint reader. Every time I’ve used it to unlock the phone it’s done so smoothly and without any issues. What’s neat about their fingerprint software is that they’ll allow you assign specific privacy settings or actions per finger. An example is that I have set my left hand middle finger to unlock the phone in Guest Mode. This will hide all the apps I would prefer to be private (ie. Amazon whatsapp tinder okcupid etc). What I have noticed though is that when opening up in ‘Guest Mode’ the apps that are marked private will be viewable for a second before they disappear. This may be the limitation of the processor or maybe the coding in the software. Hopefully this is something that can be updated in future updates.CAMERAThe Honor 5x’s camera isn’t the best in low light. So far a majority of my shots has been indoors of my dog and food and I’ve found that the images look a bit dull. The camera is quick. Quicker than the Nexus 5x camera but I don’t think it’s as vivid as it could be in low light.ALUMINUM METAL BODYThe most noticeable feature of the Honor 5x would have to be the metal body. Huawei used quality build materials for this phone and it shows. It feels and looks like a premium phone.3000mAh BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on the Honor 5x is forever. It has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S Plus which says a thing or two about a thing or two. So going 1.5 days of casual use without charging is doable. The only real downside is that the phone doesn’t utilize quick charging. I suppose you’ll rarely need it with a battery this size but most people these days have power anxiety whenever they see a phone with less than 50%. Granted for the Honor 5x 50% will last at least another half day it’s oddly comforting to know that the phone is floating around 80-100% power.BLOATWEARMy biggest and only real complaint about this phone is Huawei’s Launcher EMUI. It’s heavy and full of apps and junk I prefer not to have. It’s as if Huawei was targeting price conscious iPhone users who would be willing to make the switch. It’s not a deal breaker for me as I know someone will eventually find a way to load pure Android onto the phone. In the meantime I would RECOMMEND anybody who purchases this to download the Google Now Launcher or any other launcher. This won't completely mask the Huawei's feature but it'll make the phone more manageable. I have yet to experience any significant lag with the Google Now Launcher with this phone.RECOMMENDATIONS1. Would I recommend this phone?  Most definitely2. Would I recommend it to everybody?  Probably not. If you’re coming from a faster flagship phone I would tell you to keep your phone.3. Who is this phone for?  This phone is an easy upgrade for any android user who hasn’t upgraded their phone in the last year. Those who are okay with having a second or third tiered phone. Those who are looking for the ‘bang for their buck’. The Huawei Honor 5x is a game changer in terms of value.[...] Thank you!,1

February 22  2016By Adrian B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I want to start off by saying I have owned a wide variety of phones and this phone has the fewest bugs on its release date that I have ever dealt with. I have a lot of respect for how quick Huawei has been releasing security patches and Enhancement updates. Huawei has also promised to release Marshmallow and EMUI4 in the near future. The day the phone was released Huawei pushed out a security patch. Huawei is also in the process of pushing out an Enhancements software update that includes Android security patch level for January 2016 Updated honor icons and Additional enhancements (Firmware Version KIW-L24C567B140). More information can be found Club Hihonor forums.  Not to mention that the phone has only been release for a month from the time of this review. Bravo Huawei keep up the good work!Update: 24 hours after writing the review the update was released.Before I get into the actual review I would like to add that Huawei is asking for customer feedback and suggestions that will help improve device experience for future updates. Please do a goole search for club hihonor to register and provide feedback.  It is very important to provide this feedback so that we can continue to receive these updates. I was unable to provide links as Amazon has blocked the links.Pros:- Price - Hands down the best phone you can buy at 200.- Build Quality - Not the best but not the worst either. It does not feel cheap in the hands.- Quick OTA Updates - Honor does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.- Fingerprint Reader - Sensor location Speed and accuracy are just perfect.- 1080P IPS Display - At 401 ppi this screen is big and clear. Accurate colors. iPhones also use IPS displays over amoled.- Battery Life - I am heavy user and easily get a full day out this phone. I can get 5-6 hours of screen on time. Very pleased with battery life.- Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Flash also works very well.- SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps photos and videos will all install to SD card.- Dual sim - Not something I will ever use but it’s there.- Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. They are loud and perfect for ringtones and notification but not good at high volume for music. They server their purpose and serve it well.- EMUI Launcher - While a bit sluggish at the moment they have done very well with the ease of use of the launcher. Everything is though out very well. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.- Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Read below for more details on my favorites and least favorite.Cons:- No NFC - This was not an issue for me. Out of the 30 other phones I owned that had NFC I maybe used it 5 times. This may or may not be important to you.- Sluggish Launcher - At this time the launcher is a bit sluggish. This will most likely be resolved in a future update. The phone is fast don’t get me wrong but multitasking button is slow and some apps will sometimes hang but not for long.- No app drawer - I can adapt well to either launcher. If you hate it then install a 3rd party launcher. That is the beauty of android. However it would be nice if they included an option for both.- No headphone included - Im not complaining for 200 bucks I see why they didn’t include them but just so people are aware I thought I would mention it.- Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging and can cut down charge times in half.Wifi - One thing I want to mention right of the bat is the phone does not support 5GHz. However is this really a bad thing like some people have mentioned? Personally I don’t think so and the reason being that 5GHz has a shorter range then 2.4GHz by far. 2.4GHz is still plenty fast but yes has more interferences then 5GHz but I personally have not had an issues with interference. Microwaves and cordless phones are the two number one major interferences on 2.4GHz but who really uses cordless phones now days?  I have a AC router that supports both 5GHz and 2.4GHz and all my devices are connected via 2.4Ghz due to the range limitation that 5GHz has. I cannot use my phone outside with 5GHz connection I have to be indoors. With 2.4 Ghz I can be at the neighbors and still get a solid connection to my wifi. Would it have been nice to have both? Sure it would but you may find your self never using it like I do. Yes there are people out there that could benefit from it in highly populated areas where interference is an issue but this should not be a deal breaker.Price/Build Quality - At 200 dollars the phone is an absolute beast! The build quality is very nice and feels very expensive in the hand. However I would strongly recommend getting a clear silicon case to protect your investment as well as a glass screen protector as the metal back cover can scratch easily on your keys. The back cover has a plastic band on the top and bottom so the back cover is not completely metal.OTA Updates- Huawei is pushing out updates faster than any other company I have dealt with excluding the Nexus line of phones. Huawei does not have to wait for the carrier to approve the update so you will get the update once Huawei releases them.Fingerprint Reader - The reader works perfect. The location is absolutely perfect and feels natural in the hand. I’m certain that Apple and Samsung will soon copy the sensor location. Other phones like the iPhone and Galaxy phone that have the reader on the home button are very awkward to use. Your finger naturally rests where the sensor is located so unlocking from the pocket is a pleasure. Galaxy phones have issues with detecting your print at time. This phone works nearly every time and under 1-2 seconds. This was not something I expected from a 200 dollar phone. My only complaint is that at the moment you can only registers 5 different prints. Why do you need more you may ask? The software in EMUI allows you to open up certain apps or call a contact with an assigned print. Both mine and my wife’s prints are on my kids phones so now they are limited to only 3 prints they can use to unlock the phone and use as shortcuts.1080P IPS Display - The 5.5 Inch 401 PPI 1080p IPS display is perfect. The screen is very detailed and colors are natural and accurate. However if you are coming from a amoled display and like bright vivid colors that amoled offers you may not like this screen right away but you will definitely get used to it. This is more of a personal preference. Touch responsiveness is perfect even with a glass screen protector. The screen gets very bright outdoors and so far I have no complaints about the screen what so ever. Watching YouTube videos and viewing pictures has been a pleasure.Battery Life - The phone has a 3000 mAh battery. This is probably the best feature the phone has to offer. I’m a very heavy user and have not owned a phone that can get me through a full day. I’ve had to resort to a external power supply that I took everywhere. I no longer have to carry around the extra power supply with this phone and can easily get 5-6 hours of screen on time. I owned a Oppo Find 7a and loved it because of the large 5.5 inch screen. The downside was the battery life but the phone had quick charging and sort of made up for it. However with this phone the quick charging is not needed as it will get you through the whole day. My wife that is not a heavy user can go two days without a charge. The phone actually uses the more expensive Lithium Polymer (Lipo) vs Lithium Ion battery.Camera - While not the best it takes very good pictures even under low light. Other phones that I have owned and compared to have to use flash to get a decent picture under low light. This phone did not have to use the flash to get a decent picture under low light settings. The shutter is very fast and so far has taken less blurry photos than 95% of all the phones that I have owned excluding the Galaxy S6 iPhone 6s and LGG4 (all flash ship phones of course). My daughter is 13 years old and her whole life is around social media and picture taking. She chose the Honor 5x over the Galaxy S6 mainly because of battery life and the location of the figure print scanner. She used both phones for a few days and said she could barely tell the different in the photos. I personally can see that the photos on the Galaxy S6 were way better but to a 13 year old kid they would prefer battery life and a bigger screen over better photos and faster phone. She was unable to tell Galaxy S6 had better camera Processor and screen then the Honor 5x. I then sold the Galaxy s6 and purchased 3 more Honor 5x's for all my kids for the price of one Galaxy S6.SD card slot - Works as intended too. You can change default location to SD Card and apps photos and videos will all install to SD card. Other phones I have owned had an SD card slot but would only allow you to use it for photos and videos. It would not install app on the SD card like the Honor 5x does. I purchased a 32gb SD card and have installed a ton of games apps photos and videos on the SD card without any issues. Simply go into settings>Storage and change default location to SD Card.Dual sim - Not something I will probably ever use but its there. You have an option for a Micro sim card and nano sim card. This would be very useful if you own a business and need two lines. One for personal calls and other for business.Speakers - Again while not the best they still deserve to be in the pros list. If you compare to Galaxy S6 or HTC speakers then yes they suck. However if you are comparing to 95% of the speakers on the market they are loud and perfect for ringtones notifications and videos. They are not very good for music at high volumes but I don’t know a lot of people that listen to music from there tiny little phone speaker. Most of us have Bluetooth speakers for that. The speakers serve there purpose and serve it well for a 200 dollar phone. Even more expensive phones have a worse speakers then the Honor 5x.Charge time - The phone comes with a 1A charger and takes about 4 hours to charge from 3% to 100%. However the phone does support 2A charging so if you have a 2A charger on hand you can cut the charge time in half. 2A charging is also a verified feature on the Honor 5x website so it is perfectly safe to use a 2A charger. Again they most likely sent a 1A vs 2A charger to cut back on cost.Color Options - Phone comes in black with dark gray back cover White with Daybreak Silver and Sunset Gold with gold back cover. Out of the three the black with dark gray back was my favorite. One thing I noticed right away with the White and Gold model is the black border around the LCD. The black model still has the black border but because the front bezel is also black the border was hidden. I have taken pictures side by side so you can see what im talking about. The white was my 2nd favorite and probably would have been my first pick had they done a better job tucking in the LCD border behind the bezel. As for the gold model I did not like it at all. It does not even appear gold and at times looks like a rose gold on the back cover. The front looks more like a copper color than gold. It not horrible or unbearable but it was just the least favorite out of the three for me but my son loves it so thats all that matters.EMUI Launcher/OS - Launchers are a big subject for me because I have dealt with some crappy launchers such as Touchwiz for the Galaxy phones and ColorOS for Oppo phones. EMUI reminds me a lot of ColorOS however the EMUI 3.1 launcher was thought out very well and works way better. I didn’t like that the app drawer was gone it reminded me to much of iOS but quickly got used to it. The OS is still a bit sluggish at the moment taking some apps 1-2 seconds to open at times but I have confidence that Honor will resolve this very soon as this is more of an optimization of the OS vs and launcher issue. The processor is definitely capable of providing a smooth experience it just needs to be optimized so I hope they work on this first. My wife can use the phone without asking me too many questions and that says a lot.Overall I am very happy with this phone. Not only because it was cheap but because it was very well designed and built. Nothing feels cheap about this phone. I have paid 300 more for phones that I was not happy with. Honor has definitely raised the bar for budgets phones pressing other companies to follow the trend. I would definitely recommend this phone for anyone looking for a better than average phone on a budget.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: Since the recent update KIW-L24C567B140 the phone performs very well now.  However there are two settings that greatly effected performance. When enabling Guest Mode via Settings>Security>Privacy Protection from phone settings menu the phone takes a major performance hit. Apps would hang at times 10 secs or more to open up the camera shutter button and icons were missing from home screen and slowly start to appear. However once Guest Mode/Privacy Protection was turned off the phone performed very well. Changing power saving mode from Smart (Factory Default) to Normal also increased performance via Settings>Power Saving. I still also got a full days worth of battery life! I hope that an update will resolve this.Tips:Move multiple icons at once - I took me a while to realize that this was possible but from your home screen you can pinch the screen to bring up the Home Page setting options. You can add wallpapers Widgets change page transitions effects and access the More Settings page to change home page settings. Once you have pinched the screen can start to select the icons you wish to move. You will see a blue check mark on the icons you wan to move. Once you are read to move the icons long hold on any one of the blue checked apps you have selected and move the icons. However folders are limited to 30 apps :-(Guest Mode - Pretty cool feature but as stated above this feature really effected the performance of the phone. To enable go to Settings>Security>Privacy Protection and click Lets Start. Enter your main pass code and press next. This should bring you to the Owners Fingerprint screen do nothing here but press next. You will then be prompted to enter a guest pass code enter a pass code different from your main pass code. You should now be a the Guest Fingerprint screen from here you can add a new print or assign an existing print for guest mode. You should now be at the Privacy Protection screen main menu where you can now hide contact photo albums and hide certain application from the quest account.Notification no longer working? - Ok so EMUI OS will not allow apps to run in the background unless you say otherwise a feature I actually enjoy this may be why the battery life is so good. This will prevent apps like Facebook Ebay Facebook Messenger Spotify YouMail Netflix and Dropbox from working correctly and will also prevent push notifications. Example: Spotify and Netflixs will enable a quick menu on your lock screen and notification bar to pause play and forward music or movies. However if you do not allow the app to run in the background the app will close out once you lock your screen. Another example if Facebook. If someone messages you or if you get an update on Facebook your phone will not notify you until you allow it run in the back ground. If you are having issue with any app try this first. Go to Settings>Protected Apps> and enable all the apps you wish to receive real time notification and any app you wish to run in the background.Tired of the Power Consumption Prompt? I got sick of being reminded that certain apps were consuming a lot of power. To disable the prompts go to Settings>Power Saving>Settings and disable Power intensive prompt.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWXE,Honor 5X unlocked smartphone 16GB…,        382 of 408 people found the following review helpful       Both devices has been selling really good on amazon with similar price range and great sales ...  February 2  2016By Bbta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The phone can be looked at from two different aspect. A budget phone that costs $200 and a ""flagship killer"". I give it 5 stars for the former and 4 stars for the later. I am a nexus fan own Nexus 4 5 7 9 so you can see I will definitely not be biased against it in any way. And I am coming from an LG G2.I bought this for me and nexus 6 for my wife both around the same time. Nexus 6 being last season's flagship phone and a phone that still tops many charts in performance will be my frame of reference here. Both devices has been selling really good on amazon with similar price range and great sales recently. So here it goes. Which device you should get?Motorola Nexus 6 vs Huawei Honor 5XPackage accessories and boxingBoth come with neat boxes but nothing fancy. Both come with warranty and manuals (despite some reviews mentioning the honor 5 coming without them) and sim ejection tool. the big difference here being the charger. The honor device comes with extremely generic charger pretty slow at that too (1 amp although it performs at slower rate than other similarly advertised ones). The Motorola device comes with quick charger (2 amps goes from 10% to 100% in about 70 min compared to 2.5-3 hours). Also note that it is much much easier to find third party accessories for the nexus 6 on amazon and elsewhere (it has been around for longer after all)Winner: Nexus 6Set upBoth are android devices so a lot is common here. Both take advantage of the back up / restore function from google pretty well. Surprisingly boot up and restoring apps and settings from the honor was faster by a good margin than the nexus 6 (35 min vs 50 mins). This has to do with the multiple updates the nexus 6 has to do before you reach the Android 6.0.1 it is supposed to reach. My honor came with Android 5.1.1 out of box. Restart time for the Honor was also surprisingly better than the nexus by few seconds. I would have to given this to the honor 5xWinner: Honor 5xProcessor RAM and PerformanceLooking merely at numbers nexus 6 wins hands down. Snapdragon 805 3 GB RAM Adreno 420 GPU and pure Android experience. This translates into a very buttery performance. This thing is a beast! no lags whatsoever. It goes through apps with not even the slightest hiccup. 3D games looks amazing there. Although you may see benchmark tests slightly higher for other flagships from this year I highly doubt you could observe the difference with naked eye.The Honor 5X is mid range at best compared to that. Snapdragon 615 2 GB of RAM are no match to that beats of a device. However and this is a big however since you are looking in this price range I assume you are looking for day to day device not a gaming moster. The honor X5 is plenty adequate for that. You may see the occasional hiccups here or there (so far mostly with Google Play Store) but this is by no means an issue.Overall the Nexus performed better. However being a flagship device and a nexus device this is expected. The pleasant surprise was the Honor 5x despite having an inferior CPU GPU and RAMS and a heavier EMUI skin still performs very close to the nexus. I will have to give this one to the Honor because of that.One downside I did not like in the Honor 5x is the lack of dual band WiFi. Now unless you have an internet line with speeds exceeding 10-15 M you should be fine.On downside in the nexus 6 was the lack of an LED light for notifications. It is there as a hardware but you will have to root your device to control it. Not cool.The killer addition on the honor was the finger print scanner. Spot on and no different in performance than what you find in Apple devices or the higher end nexus 6p. Kudos!Honor 5x also has some nice features I missed from my LG G2 like tapping screen twice to wake up and flipping phone to mute alarm or ring. Those are missing from the Nexus 6.Winner: Honor 5xBatteryThe honor 5x seems to take the edge clearly here as well. Despite having the EMUI skin and the older android version I managed to get about 6-7 hours of screen on time. This is was only 3-4 on the nexus 6. Sure the nexus battery is larger but the higher pixel and stronger CPU are much more power hungry.Winner: Honor 5xDesign and qualityHonor 5x wins here as well. Metal build is no means a $600 apple iphone but is a nice tough and looks sturdier than the plastic covered nexus 6. Both are nice but the honor 5x is more likely to be mistaken for a $600 device than the nexus. Also I did not like the curved back on the nexus. It CAN NOT stay still on its back very annoying if you try to open the device or text while on the desk or ground for example.Winner: Honor 5xSoftwareI am a nexus fan so here pure android like it is meant to be is the winner. Do not get me wrong though EMUI is much less troublesome than I expected and has some nice features.Winner: Nexus 6DisplayOn paper the nexus 6 wins. More pixels larger and better coating (Corning Gorilla Glass 3 lacking in Honor 5x). However the screen colors were by no means as lively as the ones on the Honor 5x. I think it is a tie.Winner: Tie.Value for MoneyAround back Friday the nexus 6 was selling for $200. Recently it was around $250. Around that price I would have given the edge to the it. But It its current price ($350) the Honor 5x wins.Winner: 5xCameraBoth cameras are pretty comparable. The Honor 5x default app has more features but this is android! You can just download any app/feature at the touch of a bottom. Both have lacking cameras in poorly let environments. I think the Honor 5x has a slight advantage but overall I would call it a tie.Winner: TieOverall being a hardcore nexus fan I find it very hard to say but the Honor 5x has my vote. Huwaei seemed to have found it is way to the use market with just the right combination of performance price and features. Cannot wait to get their Nexus 6p which based on what I saw in this Honor device should be a incredible!",1

I wanted them to have updated phones with decent specs and im glad I made this move.PROS: Price - $200Screen - 1080P LCD Goodness that is very vibrant and bright.Materials - A nice metal build that looks premium and feels good in the hand not as good as HTC?Camera - very good performer for $200  perfect for social media.Speaker - pretty loud for ringtones and mediocre for listening to music.Battery - 3000 mAh  enough for a day of normal use!Finger print scanner works very fluidCons - The phones would lag if I started to do heavy multitasking which included the opening of more than 4+ apps  and trying to move through the phone really fast.  This is quite normal since we are dealing with a mid range CPU and 2GB ram.Overall the speed is quite sufficient if you aren't speeding through the phone.Misc - Some people may not enjoy the EMUI interface but I found it very nice!  it was a breath of fresh air to experience versus the other major players' skins in the Android market,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWXE,Honor 5X unlocked smartphone 16GB…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Great value  Great Performance  February 22  2016By Kenneth Cunningham Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have always been a fan of budget phones. With each new iteration they get better and more affordable. The Honor 5X is no exception. I have the Nexus 6P Galaxy S6 Edge + and the Moto X Pure Edition (2015). Although it is not as powerful as these phones it is still a great phone for the price. The fingerprint sensor works perfect. I love being able to us the sensor to go back to my home page take pics and check notifications. The phone is fast but it does lag a little bit. However that should be expected. It doesn't have a high end processor. However the minor hiccups can easily be overlooked by the sheer beauty and overall performance. Get this phone and you will not regret it!,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWXE,Honor 5X unlocked smartphone 16GB…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       This is an excellent phone!!!  March 18  2016By ca8050,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I will first tell you that I'm a compulsive perfectionist who is very difficult to totally please but this phone is a pure BOMB!!!  I'm very very pleased with it.  Is it ""perfect"" NO but it's far superior to the $500+ phones that AT&T sell and there is no bloatware on it.  All of the AT&T apps on my Play Store list I just hit the ""X"" in the top right corner...and doing that felt really good.The app's provided by Huawei for email music video are far better than anything you can find it the Google Play Store.Double tap to wake up and provided Screen Lock app to turn off are very convenient.Any apps that I didn't want and could not delete I just disabled.Things that I consider suggestions for improvement...1.  it's sometimes a bit slow to redraw the screens but so what.2.. the WiFi is not dual-band; it's 2.4GHz only.3. not crazy about the default launcher because there is no way to hide/remove apps that you do not want on your desktop so you have to create a ""crap app folder"".  To solve this I just applied the Google Now launcher which works perfectly...4.  without installing a 3rd party glass screen phone gets way too many fingerprints5.  without using protective case phone is too slippery to handle and the power button in located right where you grip the phone.  I would like to see the power button relocated to the top of the case.6.  would like the 3 navigation buttons to be part of the phone hardware not the android OS.  these buttons rotate with the screen which is a sometimes little awkward and confusing.7.  when charging phone displays a green light...i would like to see it red when charging and to turn green when fully charged.8.  phone is slightly too big and too heavy...smaller and lighter would be better for my taste.If Huawei offers a phone exactly like this one only with more RAM a faster processor 5GHz WiFi and a little smaller screen would be nice but not if not still OK count me in!  I'll buy it immediately but until they do this phone is still tops on my list.Am I satisfied with this phone = YESDo I recommend it = YESWould I purchase it again = YES",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B019O8YWXE,Honor 5X unlocked smartphone 16GB…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Worth the Money  May Have Gripes if You Are Coming From a Higher End Phone Due to Slowdowns  January 28  2017By Ming W.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I got this Honor 5x phone for use on my T-Mobile account.  For people that are considering this phone I want to emphasize that my review is based upon the experience of having used a Coolpad Rouge prior to this.  If you are not familiar with this phone it may be due to the fact that it is T-Mobile’s lowest priced SMARTPHONE (not a flip-phone) and one of the most economically priced out there period.  And I got what I paid for ($10 special at Bestbuy) slow to the point that I press on the screen a second time thinking that the system didn’t register the first press when in actuality it doesn’t process fast enough and when it finally catches up the second press will inadvertently open/close a page.  The screen resolution is low I squint at the screen due to its small size and clicks on the screen are not very precise causing many typing errors.  And logically people that had the experience of a higher priced and quality phone may rate this lower.  Although this is better than what I had  I will attempt to be as objective as possible with regards to the capabilities of this phone.  The bottom line is that with regards to the price it is a solid buy but heavier users beware of slowdowns and heating.  If you found this helpful please let me know!Hardware:  I’m not going to repeat what can be read in the description but this phone is the best bang for the buck as far as hardware is concerned.  Glass screen metal alloy body with a solid weight.  The battery is not removable  (unibody) and thus providing increased protection from water damage.  It is a nice size as well with a 5.5” screen.  There is also a fingerprint reader for unlocking the phone or apps and from what I’ve read is harder to find at this pricepoint.  Definite pluses in this area; this phone feels and looks like a phone that costs more. Its thin and sleek as well.  The camera takes great pics and has a variety of features.  Ultra sharp and clear. It includes various modes (food beauty selfie etc) and various filter effects (vintage mono etc) images of various sizes HDR/slow mo recording and even “all-focus” to achieve the best quality picture.  This is a Dual SIM phone for heavy users.  The phone comes with a pointy key tool to pop out the SIM and micro-sd card compartments and was easy to use.User-Interface/Processing Speed:  I had to return the first phone that I got due to constant overheating; to the point where the back of the phone is very warm 70%  of the time.  And of course this slows the phone down dramatically.  I got a replacement which didn’t overheat as much with the same amount of data used.  The phone can get warm to the touch and slow down with multiple apps running esp video watching  download/uploading simultaneously. Possibly due to only having 2GB if RAM.  I am only using 30% of internal memory storage and roughly 20% of my external sd card and 40% of the time it warms up after 20 min of continual usage esp with a phone case.  Not always a slowdown until I play videos with other apps running or dl/upload  while browsing.  The phone’s internal ROM is 16GB which should be the minimum for a medium smartphone user.  But it is generally acceptable.  Huawei has its EMUI user-interface which is simplistic and fairly streamlined.  The downside is that it constantly tries to revert customizations or 3rd party apps back to the stock EMUI interface.  For example I installed Arrow Launcher from Microsoft (the stock launcher and icons are unimpressive) and when I restart the phone it will revert back to stock.  For people that are used to a “faster” phone the slowdowns will be a deal killer.Apps/Features:  The fingerprint reader works but not efficient or precise enough for me to use as the method to unlock the phone.  I find that it takes a few tries of pressing my index finger into the reader to get it to register.  One neat feature is the storage cleaner to maintain faster processing speed; with the press of a button it will clear out the cache and even app memory (reverting apps back to pre-update status) in both internal and external memory locations.  I find it very convenient.  Bloatware isn’t really an issue there are a few apps preloaded (sound recorder EMUI marketplace) and could be useful.Battery Life:  It's pretty good but then again I've only had it for less than a month.  So far so good esp since its a 5.5"" screen.  I keep my screen at the brightest setting and I can get through the day without plugging it in with moderate/heavy use. To give a better idea  I've been having a voice recorder and LTE Discovery running in the background all day and I have enough juice to last from 8am to 10pm withou plugging in.  The charging wall adapter IS NOT 2.1 A and can be painstakingly slow to recharge.  And the micro usb cable that comes with this is short… around 3 ft.  First accesorry I got was a fast charging plug 2.1a usb port and 6 ft micro usb cable.I felt that this phone was worth the under $160 price-point but for those that have used higher end phones the existence of slower processing and heating will be a point of frustration.

If you need a smartphone  this should filter to the top of your list.  February 8  2016By Larry A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This phone is a budget phenomenon. It packs in loads of features at a very affordable price. I bought three at launch and have not been disappointed.Hardware:  Good quality metal body housing a big and bright screen. The blacks are not as dark as one would like but still looks good. The expandable micro SD slot loaded in an old card well. Be aware that this phone prefers the high-speed card so if you're looking make sure to filter to that. The phone is 5.5"" and coming from a 4.7"" Moto X (1st gen) I'm still adjusting to the size.  The metal body is slippery so I'm currently searching for a good case.Software:  Huawei's Emotion User Interface (EMUI) is rather snappy. It zips around from app to app in a rather quick manner. There are times when the app stalls as if to think about what to do but it's rare and often quickly remedied.  My largest gripe is that free RAM is often much lower than the 2 GB limit.  I'm often at less than 1GB of free RAM and I just feel as if the phone is inefficient.  The absence of an app drawer is also missed. Users are relegated to creating folders and accessing all apps from there. It took me an entire week to customize but my phone is finally where I want it to be.Phone Reception:  The phone speaker is indeed rather hard to hear out of sometimes. It's not my network either. When using a bluetooth headset the calls are clear.  I'm using T-mobile moving over from Sprint and I miss Sprint's HD voice to other Sprint users. This is a network issue and unrelated to the phone itself.Other media features like FM Radio Recorders and video playback etc.. are all top notch.  The phone is an uncompromising offer. The fingerprint scanner is the most underrated feature. I thought I'd barely use it but I hate entering a password now.  You can store up to five fingerprints so you can unlock the phone in either hand or by other people.  You can even lock e-commerce app transactions behind a fingerprint scan.  I confidently recommend this phone.",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01IVV7W8M,Huawei Honor 8 Unlocked Smartphone 32 GB…,        461 of 497 people found the following review helpful       After a few days and many tweaks  I love this phone with some frustrations  August 28  2016By D. Bez,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"EDIT (9/12/2016): Please read an addition to my review in the comments; I explain why I decided to drop my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I tried to edit my review here but Amazon rejected my edits.  I'm guessing the review was becoming too long...--I got into the Android world only recently with the Nexus 5X (I had only used iPhones before) and immediately grew to like it through the stock Android experience.  I wasn't very pleased with the speed of the Nexus 5X and how sluggish many apps would run but I didn't want to upgrade to the 6P (also made by Huawei) due to the larger size.Enter Huawei's Honor 8 which seems to be the perfect upgrade for me.THE POSITIVES:+The phone is very solidly built and put-together perfectly.  It feels more expensive than it is+The design is slim and fits in your pocket easily.  Unlike my Nexus 5X with the same screen size of 5.2"" the Honor 8 fits perfectly in my car's cupholder+This phone runs fast! Everything seems immediate with practically no discernible lag from web browsing to playing music (Apple Music to be exact) to even unlocking using the fingerprint reader+Battery life is better than my Nexus 5X.  The Nexus would last me 8-9 hours on a charge through the day the Honor 8 seems to be going at least 12 hours and more before I need to plug it in+Speaking of charging the fast charge feature is no joke.  I've found the phone to go from almost empty (3%) to 100% fully charged in little more than an hour! The phone also charges fast with any regular 2.1A USB charger such as the Anker Powerport.  (The Nexus 5X will only rapid charge with its included charger)+Forgot to mention call-quality: the phone does support VoLTE calling which is indicated by a ""HD"" icon.  VoLTE calls sound so clear that it is hard to believe you are on a cell phone.  Non-VoLTE (or non-HD) calls aren't as clear but are still pretty good quality.  Of course it all depends on your network and reception (I'm on T-Mobile and usually get their LTE or 4G HSPA network most of the time).+The Camera takes some great NIGHT shots.  Try taking a picture of the Moon using the Honor 8 and an iPhone 6; the Honor 8 will render the Moon clearly while it appears as a white blob in the iPhone's shot.  For daytime pictures I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference between an iPhone 6 vs Honor 8's shots of the same subjects.  That is not to say the Honor 8 still takes impressive daylight pictures but I'm not sure that the dual-lens function has much bearing on the quality of them.  The camera app is super-fast and can be ready to take a shot in a couple seconds unlike the Nexus who's camera app is very slow and not good for trying to catch quick one-of-a-kind moments.THE NEGATIVES:-Very simply the software out of the box is so different from what I was used to with stock Android.  I don't like many of the tweaks and visual flair that Huawei put into their version of Android (called EMUI).  It is obvious they are trying to make their version of Android look and run very much like Apple's iOS.However after much tweaking with the settings and installing some other applications I've been able to make this phone feel a lot more like what I was used to.  I've listed my tweaks below under ""Tweaks to Consider""-As part of my tweaks I tried to disable or at least hide many of Huawei's stock applications in favor of the Google apps.  But one Huawei app in particular HiVoice keeps nagging me to give it permissions to access my content and what not.  There is no way to disable that app and as much as I've tried to neuter it I still get a random pop-up for it that annoys me.  If any Huawei software engineers are reading this review PLEASE give us the ability to disable or uninstall HiVoice.  Or at the least stop it from nagging constantly to gain permissions-The phone does heat up after several minutes of use.  This is regardless of whether you are just browsing the web listening to music or playing a game-Display and Resolution: On its own the Honor 8's screen seems brilliant and renders text and images well.  But compared side-to-side with the Nexus 5X it seems to be pale in comparison.  I've included pictures where I show the two devices side-by-side.  I set both screens to display at 75% brightness; the Nexus screen (on the left) is obviously brighter than the Honor 8 (on the right).  You will also notice that the Honor 8's screen doesn't display as much information or screen real estate as the Nexus does.NEUTRALS:+- Huawei will not win any awards for original design of the Honor 8.  Just like the software the phone itself is very much a copy of the iPhone 6/s from the rounded edges to the glass screen to even the speaker holes.  The back of the phone however isn't like the iPhone as it is glass.  But then I'd say Huawei was ""inspired"" by the iPhone 4/s or the Galaxy S7 for this aspect of the design+- Since the phone was just released there aren't many cases or specifc accessories out yet.  But I'm sure the selection will expand very soonTWEAKS TO CONSIDER:The biggest advantage of Android over iOS is the ability to tweak the software to your liking.  If you are someone who is used to the stock Android experience from a Nexus phone then consider the following tweaks I made to get the Honor 8 to a similar if not the same type of experience:-Launcher: (GOOGLE NOW LAUNCHER) I downloaded and installed the Google Now Launcher from the Play Store.  This is the exact launcher that the stock Nexus devices use-Lock Screen: (MICROSOFT NEXT) I hated the fact that I couldn't get some notifications to disappear from my lock screen without having to unlock the device (in particular I may want to keep a message from a friend visible to remind me to respond but I want a spam email notification to go away).The solution I found was to download and install Microsoft's Next Lock Screen app from the Play Store.  While it doesn't fully replicate the stock Android lock screen it has pretty much the same functionality.  In addition you gain some useful quick shortcut icons on the bottom to open frequently-used apps.  Most of all you can keep the Next Lock Screen enabled and use the fingerprint-reader to still unlock the phone-Visual Voicemail: The Nexus supports Visual Voicemail within its Dialer app but the Honor 8 doesn't.  The only substitute is to download your carrier's own app for Visual Voicemail (I have T-Mobile and their app works almost seamlessly.  AT&T also has an app in the Play Store)-Remove Bloatware: Huawei does ship the Honor 8 with a few bloatware apps such as Booking.com Facebook Twitter and Lyft.  But you can uninstall the apps you don't use-Other apps downloaded: I installed the Google versions of Gmail Calendar Clock and Photos to replace the Huawei versions.  Although the Huawei versions are simple reskins that still run the Google apps underneath so this isn't a necessary tweak.  I did this just for my own comfort and familiarity simply as I am used to the Google versions.Additional Note: If you prefer to use Google's Clock app as your alarm clock make sure to enable ALL notification permissions for that app (like Priority Notifications Lockscreen notifications etc.).  Let's just say I didn't initially do that and almost was late for work the first day I tried using this phone as my alarm...OVERALL:If I had rated this phone immediately after using it in its stock form for an hour I would have given this 3 stars (for excellent hardware and terrible software out of the box).  But after using this phone for several days and making the tweaks I described above I have grown to like this phone enough to rate it a solid 5 stars.  I like it enough that I have put away my Nexus 5X in a drawer and will be using the Honor 8 for the foreseeable future.  I do recommend this phone for the power Android user and anyone else who is comfortable making tweaks as well as someone who doesn't care about their software experience but does want a high-quality fast and powerful phone.  If you are someone new to Android who wants an inexpensive phone and can tolerate some sluggishness I'd suggest getting a Nexus 5X instead.  Or even a cheaper Android phone such as Blu.  I don't believe the extra cost for the extra features of the Honor 8 will be worth it to the latter type of users.",1

Here's a tip add Google Calendar to excluded from power management list or you won't get reminders when the phone is sleeping.Updated 2/20/17Further pre-installed software issues have me continually lowering my rating. Upgrade to Android 7 put my back on the stock launcher and added more crap software that (to me) seems clearly setup to capture data it doesn't need and transport it to someone I don't want to have it. Can you tell me why the customer support app need access to my contacts? New update's SMS app is an absolute nightmare (I considered dropping my rating from 5 to 2). I wasted 3 hours trying to replace the stock SMS app (which now does not show the names of people responding in MMS messages so a group text with 5 people it's impossible to know who said what even worse if you manage to remember the color-coded icons that go with a person...sometimes it will show the wrong color for like 10 seconds and even click through to the wrong contact). Why not replace the app if I hate it so much? I would love to but it's married to the device. I've replaced with 2 different apps set those apps and default and even disabled the SMS pre-installed app and revoked all the SMS privileges for the stock app. I could get SMS to work fine but any text to more than 1 person the phone will either deliver it to the stock app anyway (they all show up and unreadable 1kb message bubbles from individual senders if the stock app is not the default SMS app or it just seems to do nothing). At the end of the day after 3 hours of work I could never get an MMS message to deliver to any other app so I'm stuck with the garbage stock app. Last order of business the stock app takes forever to load a long conversation (anything with more than 50 messages). It loads with a bunch of dates then the bubbles start loading it's like watching an image gallery webpage load on dialup.,0

I have only had it for a few days but I am very impressed with it. The Honor 8 is a finger print magnet and it is smaller and lighter than the phones that I am used to. But having said that it has a very feel and balance to it. The demsions are andt 5.5 x 3 inches and as I stated earlier this puts it about a half an inch smaller than my other phones. The Honor 8 is running Android 6 and home screen lancher called EMUI  version 4.1. It is supposed to help organize your ""Honor 8 experience"". While it was okay I went back to the Nova lancher (my preference not pushing Nova).  For those interested Huawei had brought back the NFC funtionality but I (at this point) have no need for that. The online reviews compares this phone to the Samsung S7 but at almost the the price. At roughly $300 this is a very good phone video and sound quality are very good. This is a mid range phone that in my option competes directly with the higher end models.",0

This isn't long enough to tell if it will be good long term but enough to tell if I like the phone or not.First of all I bought this to replace two dying LG phones- a G3 and G4 both with huge hardware issues. So far in that respect the Honor has been awesome. It works.Now down to the nitty gritty. Both of the aforementioned LG phones had qualities that I loved in a phone. Amazing cameras amazing displays removable batteries almost stock Android. The Honor 8 can't really hold up in that regard. The camera is not nearly as good as even the G3. It gets the job done so I don't really worry about it. I can't remove the battery but it has great life so I don't worry about it. And though I do miss stock Android quite a lot the weird OS Huawei installs is inoffensive and has some neat features (especially scheduled power on and off!).Also it has USB C. Huge plus. It has a very responsive and accurate fingerprint sensor. I thought I would miss LG knock codes but I do not.Overall this is a super solid phone with some great features. Does it blow me away like the LG phones did? No which I do miss. But I'll take stability over a non working screen or no WiFi.,0

As I received it the headphone jack was not working when I plugged in the headphones the sound was very bad quality I am not even able to enjoy a song (which is really important to me) but the sound that comes out of the iphone is good quality just not able to listen through the headphone jack. The phone has always been in a lifeproof phone case it has never been drop I have not submerged into water and it is new. I was going to let go of the sound problem even though I was dissappointed; but on saturday the touch started giving me problems. Yesterday (sunday) I was not able to use my phone at all  even though I restarted the phone several times to see if that would help but it did not; even if it did work it would not last for more than 15 seconds. I left the phone alone for the rest of the day and today I turned it on the touch works when it wants to (and if it does it just last for some minutes if lucky) and stops whenever it decides. Right now I am not beeing able to use it.I got to the conclusion that the phone came with failures and maybe it is just  my bad luck and the rest of the phones came out good but I really would like to know if there is something I could do about it because honestly I do really need it and in this condition it is just a waste of money. Please contact me if you think I could send the phone back and get another that works properly.Thanks and bye!,0

Just for all you guys out there the way to identify whether the screen is repaired or original; (a) When you put some pressure on original screen you won't see any fade of colors while you will see colors heavily fading from the pressured area on the screen. That's third party low grade screen for iphones and are not of good quality at all. (b) You'll always find a thin gap on the sides of the screen and phone accidental exposure to water from the sides can immediately damage the phone. However when Apple replaces a screen its replaced via machines so there is no gap at all.How can you sell something like that? Selling cheap without letting others know what it could be is simply fooling others and by the way it wasn't cheap enough to match what you actually sold. Attached are the two images to show the gap.,1

I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that.  Let's be real this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is.  If you want it for that purpose it does every thing you need.  If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone you're going to want to go with something with a little more features.  This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag.  That's exactly what this phone is for.  The controls are not slick the construction sucks and is cheap and the sim card is hard to remove but honestly if I ever had to use this and the time on that card chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks.,0

My regular cell is an iPhone.  I got this as an international travel phone because it is cheap simple unlocked and dual SIM and has a long battery life.  It takes full size SIM cards.  Inserting the SIM cards isn't immediately obvious.  The instructions are useless. I figured it out by carefully studying a little icon impressed into the plastic above the battery compartment.  Taking the cover off to get to the SIM cards is a little bit of a pain to take off and put back on again.  You'll need a microSD card if you want to take pictures.  I previously had the Tank T190 and liked it.  This is an incremental improvement except for getting to the SIM cards.  If you are going to frequently change SIM cards I wouldn't recommend this phone.  Otherwise this make a great little travel phone or backup phone.,0

April 10  2016By Vironia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this phone because I needed it to hold my other foreign SIM cards. Opened the boxed packaging from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this phone! I was honestly expecting cheaper plastic and something more tacky-looking. But this phone actually looks decent - the white casing with blue accent looks cute - and this is coming from a usually hard-to-please designer!Look & feel: The textured casing makes the phone allows for a firm grip and the size is perfect for one-handed operations. The white & blue casing with a hint of silver as the directional keypad and matte grey as the fonts looks pleasant.Keypad/buttons: Keypad/buttons are well designed with just the right size and good tactile feedback. The keypads are grooved too so this makes it quite nice to press. The keys are very responsive as well - no ""laggy"" feeling between button presses as with some smartphones!Display: For something that's under $20 it works well enough. The important part is I could read everything clearly!Sound: Good enough to play the FM radio - there was a talk show on and I could hear every word loud & clear without the volume turned up even. I can't speak for the music quality though I'm used to very high-end audio so my ears are forever spoiled.Camera: This phone is under $20. Let's not expect too much here. ;)Dual-sim: This works as advertised. Takes full size SIM. I have a micro SIM which I fit within the full size cutout of my full size SIM cardboard (you'll get the whole cardboard when you purchase a SIM pack from your mobile service provider).Bonuses:- The FM radio is a really nice touch. You could listen to the radio with this.- Phone also comes with a F1 racing game.- Torchlight is functional :)Overall: Definitely worth the price I paid for. I'm impressed that they managed to make a phone that looks decent feels solid and allows dual-sim for a reasonable price. If you want a back up (dumb)phone this is .",1

Got this for teenage son for first phone. Does the job. Is unlocked used with T-Mobile prepaid. No issues at set up. Does have dual SIM (at least the blue one did). Can use business number on one SIM and personal number on other SIM. Doesn't fit my needs but thought I'd mention it. Battery is nice and long. No decent instructions come with it so just takes time to figure everything out. Can lock the keypad by pressing the top left corner control button and the ""*"" key. However this doesn't prevent the phone from shutting off if the power button is held down. I don't like that fact but it's the only real complaint j have. The radio works well and my son has managed to get music on a mini SD card loaded into the phone so it acts as an MP3. Has a camera but he and I do not believe you can send or receive photos (at least we haven't been able to). Durable little phone my son is clumsy and drops things a lot so this one has held up for a month so far with no issue. No internet access on this phone (this was the whole reason we purchased it). Did not feel 13 yr old should have access to the entire world in the palm of hand. Lot of responsibility there and with this generations focus to validate self through social media waned to keep his focus on his real life accomplishments and face to face interactions with friends. He will go through those motions on his own as all teens push for that freedoms and experience. Be for now while he is still on the younger side of teenage years this phone works wonderfully for us. P.S. My son has taken our encouragement to be fun with his ""outdated"" type phone in school and often makes remark as it is his Stone Age phone enticing humor amongst his peers. He says he doesn't mind it being outdated and even likes that it's a little sturdier than his friends. (Of course he does dream for an iPhone but just thought I'd mention it in case any other parents out there were in the same place I was and worried your child might hate you for an outdated phone. They won't they know you love them and are thinking in their best interest. It shows.) Hope this review details enough for any type I future buyer.",0

September 13  2016By Howzatar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This phone is just okay.  It's not very intuitive...maybe just because I'm so used to a smart phone.  This is the only reason I could come up with to ding my review rating to 4 stars.  I really only bought this phone as a pay-as-you-go phone to allow me to port my home number to this phone and then to a GoogleVoice #.  I did play with the phone for the few days it took to get things all ported over between different services.  I had to use it to answer several calls with our home number.  The sound was pretty good.  No complaints there.  It was just like any other phone I have had before I got a smart phone.  Overall for the price of this phone it is a GREAT Deal.The whole phone is really just plastic and the back seems kind of cheap but hey...what can you complain about when you only pay $18 for a cell phone.  My kids don't have a cell phone and I certainly don't intend to give them a smart phone.  I do plan to hold onto this phone as I contemplate allowing my kids to have a pay-as-you-go phone for emergencies.  This is great as a starter phone for them.This phone does have FM radio available.  That's kind of cool.  It's WAY too easy to turn it on accidentally and if you're not used to it it's hard to figure out how to turn it off.  That happened when I took it in to the phone provider to activate it.  We spent the next 10 minutes pushing buttons trying to turn it off.  I'm sure you'd get used to this if you used it regularly.I didn't add any photos as I think the photos in the listing are quite sufficient.Oh one other thing...I wish it came with a manual.  Not a big deal I guess as I was able to locate it online.  Some of the buttons aren't labeled or in intuitive locations which kind of made it hard for me to figure it out at first.,0

Errico,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this phone because I was going to be visiting Montreal QC and my primary phone doesn't work there.  I researched a simple unlocked phone compatible with networks outside the US and came across the BLU Tank.  Based on the description I should have been able to purchase and install a SIM card for any GSM carrier to use the phone.My local friend took me to a mall with several cell phone kiosks and shops.  One by one they scanned the phone's barcode or looked up the serial number and determined that the phone was incompatible.  Virgin Mobile Koodo Fido and Rogers at the mall.  I later found out Virgin uses AT&T's network and Koodo uses Telus.  AT&T and Telus are CDMA networks in Canada so that's on me.  But Fido uses Rogers network which is GSM.  Even the Rogers shop itself told me the phone was incompatible with their network.I next tried a Best Buy.  Their prepaid service in Canada is Chatr which is also through Rogers and so its a GSM network.  In true Best Buy fashion they ended up presenting me with a Catch-22.  They said they couldn't determine if the BLU Tank was compatible with Chatr unless it was activated.  But they couldn't activate it unless I purchased a SIM card and minutes.  I wasn't about to buy something that the store didn't even know would be compatible so I left.Perhaps there's a carrier somewhere in Montreal that would have worked with this phone but I didn't find it.  This phone is advertised for international use and compatibility yet it doesn't seem to work with any GSM networks.In terms of hardware its a simple design and looks like it would have been worth the price if I had gotten it activated.  If you plan on traveling with this phone I guess you should expect to spend a day calling major wireless providers at your destination to determine compatibility.,0

Large keys and bright easy-to-read keypad - even a radio! BUT there was no getting the phone to either send or receive calls. Immediately after receiving the phone I had a techy friend insert the SIM card but there was no result. The useless trinket went back into its box --- until last Saturday January 28 2017 when I calledConsumer Cellular my service provider to ask if they would try to make my new cell phone operational if I sent it to them. Instead they referred me to their service technicians at Target and made a 3PM appointment for me. For two solid uninterrupted hours (3-5PM) two incredibly patient and conscientious technicians tried every fix they could come up with to get the phone working. Of course I had been paying monthly service fees long before the new unusable phone ever came and have continued to pay for unusable service ever since its arrival. Reluctantly the two gentlemen pronounced the new-and-never-used BLU Tank II T 193 not usable and suggested I ask Amazon to replace it with a workable unit. On checking the Amazon returns information I learn that opportunity to return the faulty phone expired in November so I'm without a cell phone as I prepare for an out-of-town trip and need one badly for emergency contacts.  Amazon and ole BLU both of you done me wrong - and for no reason. Am I blue? You'd be too. Ain't these tears in these (one of them blind) eyes tellin' you?,0

July 6  2016By Claribelle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This cute little phone is great! I took it to Europe and used it in France for a week- everything worked out fine. I bought a SIM card when I got there for about 20 euros which allowed me unlimited texting/calling for 10 days! This allowed me to be in contact with my French friends easily and so I felt safe having it as I was often exploring the city on my own. I even dropped the phone once on a hard floor and it was fine. When you put the SIM card in it is normal for it to speak to you in its own language (in my case French)- this is not the phone's ""fault"" it's programmed into the card- you can indeed change the language. Some people complained about the difficulty opening the back cover and also inserting a SIM card- to me neither was really a problem. To pop the back case off I just used my two thumb nails to pry it open... you could probably use a letter opener or something like that if your fingers are too big. To put the case back on do remember to put in the two little bottom prongs first or it will snap into place without being all the way on. For the SIM card it was indeed helpful to have small fingers to place it in its slot... I guess you could use tweezers if needed. Also remember that the bottom slot is like a drawer which you need to pull out in order to put in the SIM card. It did take me a little while to get used to the phone and to figure out what the symbols meant; like some people said the directions aren't too helpful- but honestly it was pretty self-explanatory especially if you're used to non-Smartphones (like me!). The online guide another reviewer mentioned was helpful as well so print that out and take it with you. All in all I was really happy with this phone and look forward to taking it with me on another adventure!",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01LW9P0H4,Moto Z Play - Black - 32GB (U.S.…,        128 of 135 people found the following review helpful       Unbeliveable that this phone is this great  at that price  October 25  2016By Bobby Williams Jr.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Four hundered and fifty bucks.  Unbeliveable that this phone is this great at that price.  I would like to give my thoughts on the Moto Z Play unlocked after using it for a week.  I preordered and purchased a Galaxy S7 regular version earlier this year but have had a hardware lust for a few weeks.  So here is my two cents on the features of the Moto Z Play from a Galaxy S7 owner.Build Quality:  The Moto Z Play is amazingly well built for the price.  A glass and aluminum sandwich with 2.5D curved glass on the front.  After using that glass on the galaxy it is hard to go back to not having that gently curve of glass when swiping into the side of the screen.  Also kudos to Lenovo for making the antenna lines centered on the top and bottom of the phone. No ugly plastic stripes here.Display:  OK so the Galaxy S7 was always going to win this one.  Samsung makes the best screens but the 1080p OLED screen on the Moto Z Play is a very good display.  I do not feel like I am loosing anything by using it.Camera:  The Galaxy S7 has a fantastic camera so I was expecting the downgrade from it.  The Moto Z Play takes good pictures in good light but the HDR is VERY slow.  Taking up to two seconds to process one HDR photo.  It takes acceptable pictures though just not world changingly fast like Galaxy S7Software and performance: Damn is the Moto Z Play fast.  Like I cannot tell this is a midrange phone no lag make me question what a flagship is good for fast.  The software is buttery smooth have not had any lag at all.  Also plays any game I have tried including Ripetide GP: Renegade possibly the most graphic intensive game to date on android.Fingerprint Sensor:  Surprised at how fast the Moto Z Play fingerprint sensor is.  You barely have to touch it and the screen is on and unlocked.  Much faster that the button fingerprint combo you have to use on the Galaxy S7Moto mods:  Didn't buy any because I did not know if I was going to be keeping the phone but now that I am going to keep it the JBL speaker looks very interesting.Battery Life: Wow what an amazing battery.  Only had to charge the phone 4 times in a week.  I get 2 days easily without having to worry about charging the phone.  Last time I checked I got 6 hours of screen on time and was constantly streaming spotify and podcasts without having to charge the phone for two whole days.  The fast charger that is included does a fantastic job too.  Giving me about 15 to 20 percent battery in 15 minutes.Anyway hope someone takes a look at how great of a job Lenovo has done with the Moto Z Play.,0

I'm coming from a nexus 5x which well had a few terrible bugs (muting conference calls wtf) and terrible battery life.  This z play is a revelation.  It's blazingly fast compared to the 5x.  It feels faster even though 8 x a53 cores shouldn't be faster.  I have a s7 for work and it feels no slower.  The build is great and feels at least as nice as day a Samsung s6/s7.  Our Google pixel phones came today as well and honestly this feels as fast and build wise more expensive.  The battery life is amazing too.  Maybe losing 5% after surfing the web for an hour is pretty special.The price is a bit more than Motorola's last gen.  I had a 2015 moto x ..... And this is just a better phone than that.

December 16  2016By Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So I bought the 64gb moto z first and used it for 1 week and I absolutely loved the phone. It was super thin super fast I love stock android and for only $50 more it was a no brainer however my biggest complaint with all androids I have owned is battery life sucks so I always end up switching back to my iPhone. So I been reading all the reviews and everyone is saying this moto z play is the best battery life ever and also saying that the snapdragon 625 is a powerhouse. I was in dis belief before buying this phone that both of those statements were true. So let me tell u I absolutely positively love this phone. The first day I setup the phone to my liking and still went 2 1/2 days on one single charge. Also the snapdragon 625 is pretty dam fast. No stutter no lag whatsoever. I have to say I don't play games at all so I have no clue about game performance. I am a heavier texter some phone calls internet browsing and YouTube. I can't praise this phone enough. Take this review with a grain of salt and test it out for yourself but I will say that I returned the 64gb moto z and just did something I thought I would never do. I sold my iPhone 7 today that's how much I love this phone.,0

December 1  2016By Sergio,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Previously I had an LG V10 and before that an LG G2. But after some quality issues experiended with those LG phones (bootloop and touchscreen dead zones) I decided to change to another brand and was looking in the $400 range.The phones I was considering were One Plus 3 Huawei Honor 8 ZTE Axon 7 Nexus 6P and Moto Z Play. After looking at each one closely I decided on the Moto Z Play and I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.After only one week I can say the following about this phone:THE GREATBattery life is amazing. I unplug the charger from my phone at 6:00am in the morning and with regular to heavy use (Facebook Instagram Web Browsing Spotify Netflix Camera etc.) before sleeping I still have 50-55% and don't need to plug it until 10:00pm of the next day when the battery is around 5%.Speed of phone is excelent considering it has a ""mid-range"" Snapdragon 625. I seriously can't see the difference from my previous LG V10 that had a higher spec proccesor. Everything is fluid and snappy.THE GOODAmoled Screen. I had a QuadHD LCD screen on the LG V10 but I prefer the screen of the Moto Z Play even if it's only 1080p. Colors are great and I can't see the diference between QuadHD and 1080 from now on I prefer Amoled.I love the design of the phone feels very premium and I don't mind the size (the LG V10 was a huge mini-tank and I liked it)  altough hopefully for the next version it has smaller bezels.The fingerprint is excelent 95% of the time it responds instantly.THE SURPRISINGAndroid is almost stock but the little touches that Motorola adds are great specially the notifications waving my hand in front of the screen feels Jedi-like and it's very useful at work where I have my phone on the desk and I just check if it's something important.I ordered the phone with the Camera Mod and it works awesome. Moto Mods really feel innovative and I'm thinking of buying the speakers and power pack case.Speaker in the front is surprisingly good for listening music from Spotify Netflix and Youtube.OTHER STUFFThe 3GB of RAM are very good I don't notice the reload of weg pages on Chrome when I have many tabs open.Bluetooth works without problem. I tested it with some bluetooth headphones that I use for running and it works without issues.Camera is good but not great. This is one area that I miss from my LG V10 it had a much better camera.Headphones Sound Quality is ok. I have in-ear Audio-Technica headphones and compared to the mighty audio quality from the LG V10 it's definitely a step down. But it works ok for compressed music from Spotify and the occasional music video from Youtube.You can't change the battery but since it lasts so long is not an issue for me.Call Quality is good enough.THE BADThe Glass on back is a fingerprint magnet and it seems like it will break at the first fall. Hopefully I can attach the Moto Mod Cover for now and right now I'm awaiting my bumper case.The charger that comes with the phone has turbocharging (and it's great) but the cable is atached permanently to the charger. Being this my first USB-C device I don't have any USB cable to connect to my PC or my external battery packs so I now have to order an extra cable.CONCLUSION:A great midrange phone that feels like premium phones that are $200 - $300 more expensive. Highly Recomended.",0

Having some nitpicky issues getting used to Android again after spending a few years using iPhones and Windows - I mainly miss the seamless voice control integration with the car that I had on Windows phone (that's the one thing Windows phones do better than anything else - with no special hardware or software required). Feel free to share a good Android car solution. The fingerprint sensor is too easy to mistake for a home button - would be nice if it could be re-mapped. This phone is a little bigger in real life than I expected - takes some getting used to if you're coming from a smaller device. But these issue are minor. The camera is fantastic the mods are maybe a little gimmicky but I think they have a lot of potential (I got the Hasselblad mod at a great Black Friday price though the phone's built-in camera is arguably superior in a few ways). Performance on games and videos is great. Integration with Google Drive is so smooth with a good connection that it's almost like local storage.  Battery life is awesome and the turbo charger is impressive.,0

After narrowing it down I found the Moto Z Play an appealing choice. My other choice would have been the ZTE Axiom 7 but I saw complaints about weak signal reception and lets face it if you can't get reception the phone is going to make you unhappy. Back to the Moto Z Play - Display is vibrant and sharp. Processor is quick even with multiple apps up...No lagging. Love the Motorola unique gestures. Double chop - flashlight turn upside down - silent mode flick over - activate camera and pass hand over to see notifications. I find myself passing my hand over my wife's Apple out of habit. I've seen some criticism of the camera but pics are excellent in daylight and certainly acceptable for night time shooting. The battery life is excellent and the phone charges quickly with turbo charge. And if you want slap on a battery back and go even longer between charges. Wi-Fi range and LTE reception is great. Also there is of course a headphone jack. I would have considered the next Motorola up but with no headphone jack it was no deal! Bottom line - The Moto Z Play is a solid mid-priced phone that performs as well as phones costing much more.,0

Even if you do want to game a lot it's not like you won't be able to but your frame rates and loading times will be a little slower than with a phone with a higher end processor.The display is beautiful. It's only 1080p and not 2K like a lot of flag ships but it is a gorgeous 1080p screen. My past 2 phones had 2k screens and this screen does not feel like a downgrade. In normal day to day use you won't be able to tell the difference.....AND....that 1080p screen is part of the reason the battery life is so good.The Motorola specific features(Moto Voice Moto Display Moto Actions etc) are nice and hard to live without once you get used to them.There are a few slight cons with this phone but none of them are deal breakers. It is a little unnecessarily large in my opinion. The bezels are a little large on all sides. The camera is acceptable but not great at all.  The Motomods feel like an unnecessary gimmick to me. I have the speaker and it is nice but you can get better sound and more volume from $20 bluetooth speakers. The style shell mods are nice but I wish there were more options. You don't really need any of the battery mods because the battery life is already class leading. The projector is overpriced for what you are getting. The camera mod is not very good.  Also The mods are a little more lose when attached to the Moto Z Play than when attached to the regular Moto Z or Moto Z force. I suspect the Z and Force have magnets on the bottom and top of the phone while the Z Play only has magnets on the bottom of the phone.All in all this is a great phone. Hard to beat for the money.,0

January 26  2017By Danielle B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was one of the note 7 casualties and didn't like any other phone Samsung had to offer. I had a 2014 Moto x and loved the phone until the battery crapped out on me so I thought I'd try this Moto z play. The phone is great! I've always loved the features of the Motorola phones and the bare bones Android. I've had the phone a couple months now and love it. I've had no issues and the battery life is phenomenal. I use my phone for everything and still have sometimes over 50% battery at the end of the day. I just moved half way across the country recently and drive two days at 10 hours a piece. I had my GPS on the whole time and had to make multiple phone calls to the other driver and I still had 30%+ battery at the end of the day. I've never had a phone that could do that. This phone doesn't have top of the line specs now top of the line screen but honestly you don't even notice. I've always had the best phone out there and change phones frequently. I thought the lower specs would negatively affect what I do on my phone (make it slower to do things I wanted it to for example) but I've not noticed anything different than the top phones out there. I'm not a heavy gamer on my phone so you might notice if you game a lot. I mostly read articles and do some light gaming. I highly recommend this phone. It's great quality and you can't beat the price!,0

I believe the old owner sold this phone because of this. lol. phone screen 0 scratches. as well screen works fine and apps works as well its unlocked. mummy the charger that came with the phone was not the original and no headphones and the original box too not there. Just a note to you guys. who ever got the phone on bad terms I did read and was scared a bit. I believe your stories. I guess its about luck who gets it 100% good shape or bad. mine is 99% only that scratch that nobody can see. this my first day using it. hope in the next few days wouldn't have a problem.,1

I had my phone stolen and I couldn't get it replaced by the insurance company so I decided to go on Amazon and try buying an iPhone. I was a little sketchy about it but I really wanted it so I decided to do it. My phone came in on time the phone looks brand new and the screen was perfect! Don't be nervous or have any doubts I'm really happy with what I got. It's totally worth it. It looks so new that's it hard to believe someone before me owned it. It doesn't bring a SIM card but if you already have one then your set. Don't think twice just do it trust me!! Thanks guys!!,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01N1JV80Z,Huawei Mate 9 with Leica Dual Camera - 64GB…,        132 of 140 people found the following review helpful       Huawei Mate 9 is the best phone I have ever had  January 17  2017By PlantKiller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been in the cell phone industry for much of my career. I worked for Motorola and was one of the first to get my hands on the newest cell phones in the 90’s. Startacs Razors you name it. I have had my share of Motorola smart phones which I loved at the time and Samsungs. Though I have ‘allowed’ my wife to have an Apple I could never bring myself to over pay for one myself as I am deeply rooted in the Android eco-system.When I finally got my hands on a Nexus 6P (from Huawei) I thought all my prayers were answered but along comes the Mate 9. Faster better battery life and BIGGER. I have come to the conclusion that bigger is better and the Mate 9 is bigger (battery screen faster more beautiful) in every way. I even love the EMUI interface which surprised me Huawei has really listened to its customers and create a wonderful product.Let’s look at the most important features:The battery – When the 6P came out and it’s a great phone many reported it would last all day but not like the Mate 9. It really does.The finger print reader – Never again am I fumbling to get to my phone fast and accurate as they come.The camera – This is awesome my son is a profession photographer and he loves all the features I can barely understand and the beauty mode makes even an old guy like me look good.The performance – Bar none the best I have ever had. I never wait and everything is so smooth.Connectivity – Again I have had nothing like this. The Mate 9 seamlessly switched you back and forth to the best connection and automatically reconnects to WIFI for an exceptional experience. Until you have experienced WIFI+ you are missing the best speed you can get! Add to that more cellular bands and better coverage than ever.Dual sim cards for you business guys such a cool feature.Storage – Comes with a lot but it actually has a SD card slot imagine that Apple and Pixel.So if there is a con to this phone what would it be? Most likely the fact you don’t have one! Maybe you should get one and figure that out for yourself I bet it will be hard to find.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01N1JV80Z,Huawei Mate 9 with Leica Dual Camera - 64GB…,        92 of 99 people found the following review helpful       Great phone so far for an even better price!  January 6  2017By Mark S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just received this phone today and switched from Verizon to AT&T to get it to work. I had no issues with SIM cards or setup. I will give a quick impression now and then update later after I've spent some time with it. Out of the box externally it looks beautiful. I love the metal back and the dark color. The screen is huge with very small bezels. I'm used to 2k screens but the 1080 on this phone looks so crisp I barely notice the difference. The software seems pretty well optimized. I was able to switch launchers easily. I had some issues with their backup software so I just manually did everything through google. Very little lag and everything opens immediately. The camera is very fun to use and has a lot of features to play with.*Weekend Update*After spending the weekend with the phone I am still very happy with my purchase.The battery life is great compared to my old phone. I play Clash Royale and check it frequently for texting and social media and snapchat and I can easily get through the day without having to charge it. There is very little drain while the phone is idle also which is nice. As long as you don't leave a ton of apps open constantly. They have a function that alerts you to background processes using up heavy battery but it can get a little frustrating with Facebook and Spotify. Those two apps will constantly restart themselves in the background to refresh info so I'd say once every hour or so I get a warning alerting me to close background apps that aren't physically running on the phone. The app itself is killed there is just a process running.  Would be nice to be able to permanently lock the Facebook app from reopening itself but I don't so much blame the phone for that as I do Facebook developers.Performance is still great. With past phones they tend to heat up when using games even right out of the box but the Mate can handle everything I threw at it with no lag. I tested Clash Royale the new Roller Coaster Tycoon port and Non-stop Knight. No problems across the board.I noticed  the notifications do not appear on your lock screen by default like not even an icon saying you have a notification. You have to go into each app in the settings individually and select which appear on the lock screen. Otherwise without unlocking it you have no way of knowing you have a message besides the LED. So it can be fixed you just have to take the time to do it. Speaking of unlocking the phone the fingerprint reader is phenomenal. I've never used a backside reader before so I figured it would be weird getting used to but this fingerprint reader is so quick it to me no time at all to adjust. You don't have to click to turn the screen on at all you just tap your finger on the reader quick with the screen completely black and it will unlock to your home screen instantly. Also there is feature that you can swipe on the reader to scroll through pictures or to bring down the settings screen which I think is pretty cool. Finally you can double click the volume down button to instantly take a picture from the lock screen. Again this happens almost immediately it's one of my favorite features so far.I changed my rating to 5 stars for now because I do love the time I've spent with the phone. I'll probably update again after about a month and definitely after they push the Alexa update that is supposed to be coming. Until then enjoy if you decide to buy! It's a great deal!,0

The Mate 9 has aligned with all my expectations (thus far) having never been a Huawei customer.  I Iove the fingerprint scanner love the screen (especially how bright it can get outside) love the 2-3 days I can get between battery charges (YMMV) love the feel in hand love the camera love the 64 gb storage and storage upgrade with memory card option love the call clarity/loudness (speakerphone included) and love the reception (more ATT bars at my house & work than previous Moto X 2014 Pure Edition).  I also like EMUI coming from the Moto X Pure.  I'm hoping for a car charger from Huawei in the near future.  Overall it seems this phone will do me fine for the next 2+ years.",0

This watch has auto loss which works and the Bluetooth range is pretty good. It has 3 watch faces (all analog) but when you swipe up to unlock you see a digital watch. Most of the features require a SIM card or Micro SD card to use though. The notifications only work on android but if you know your notification tones then it'll play through the Watch Bluetooth audio. The sleep tracker and step tracker works and the alarm which wakes you up easily. The calling is a pain because on the home menu the call for Bluetooth is there but in the menu screens it makes you use a SIM card. The messaging doesn't work and you can't text people but Hey Siri works by saying it to the watch. People understood me clearly when I talk to them via watch microphone. I recommend this watch to people who want one to use for phone and fitness but nothing more,1

If you're looking for iPhone/Android type features and apps this is not the phone for you. This is a neat little ""gadget."" I certainly am not planning on using this as my main phone but I bought it for the geek factor. I thought it'd be neat to wear once in a while so I can get my James Bond on and have people be all ""Oh that's neat!""Now that we got that out of the way I'll go on the watch itself. The manual is obviously written by a non native English speaker. No big deal to me as most of it is pretty self explanatory. The watch is big! I don't really mind as I prefer larger watches but this is cutting it close size wise. It came partially charged and I did not want to wait to charge it so I played with it right away. I placed my SIM in the back of the phone and it immediately recognized it. I had to manually update the time/date. I placed a test call and it worked perfectly. The phone itself has a speaker and it also comes with a set of headphones. The headphones plug into the USB jack (it's not the standard Mini/Micro USB jack.)Incoming calls worked fine as well. The screen and the ringtones remind me of Nokia type technology from the early 2000's so don't expect much. The camera worked but to be honest it's probably not of much use to anybody. Texting was a bit of a pain. the screen is very small for texting and even with the included stylus it's a chore. It does have the ability to handwrite on the screen but writing one letter at a time will wear you out.Didn't even bother with the video recorder/player or the MP3 player.Couldn't figure out the internet. It didn't automatically configure itself. Even if I could figure it out I'm not sure I'd ever use it. Maybe this weekend I'll mess around with the settings because I would like to be able to receive my email on it as well.All that being said. If you're looking for a neat little gadget to wear once in a while and are fine with the early 2000's cell phone screen/menus then you'll like this.Edited to add: I wore this out for lunch this past weekend and the waitress loved the look of it. When I told her it was a phone she about flipped. Lol. YMMV.",0

Knote,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,For what it cost- this thing is great!Its cheap.No wifi- so you have to sync to your phone or give it a SIM card.One thing took me a few minutes to figure out.  The Sync/ Notification app for your other phone:1. it does not come in the box.2. they do not provide the link.To get the app:Tap the pale blue icon to the right of the camera icon it will open a QR code.  Use a QR code reader on your phone to get the app.Apparently my vibration doesn't work.I'm not sure what the sleep monitor does.  I clicked start when I went to bed.  It started a timer.  I clicked stop when I woke up.  It stopped the timer.  That's it.  Nothing more.Its not as small as an iWatch-Its pretty much all plastic- which also means it is very light on the wrist.So- for the price- I am impressed I'll update this review after I've used it for awhile.,1

Buy if:- you are so used to wearing a wrist watch you would not leave home without it;- you don't have a data plan;- you plan on using a blue tooth ear piece or head set;- you only need three functions: show the time receive phone calls and text messages;- you will return your watch phone to the charger every night.Do not buy if you need a smartwatch to send notifications from your smartphone. The Android app sucks! I only use it to set the time. Also beware that texting on the tiny touch screen should be reserved for emergencies.The watch has a built in speaker and microphone. In a pinch you make a call from it. With a blue tooth headset it makes for a very usable compact 2G phone. It also has a functional audio player and a slot for micro SD card. You need the card in order to use the built in camera and the audio player. Based on my experience I should not have bothered with the memory card because:- Low image quality makes the camera useless and- Playing music on blue tooth depletes the battery in a few hours.I needed a replacement for my flip phone and the Dick Tracy phone does a good job. Other features like camera music player and connectivity are not working as well as I'd like them to. Hence the four star rating. Despite the limitations it is a good value if you know what you are getting.,0

Save money by not buying the Apple watch  April 24  2016By Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I loved the idea of having a smart watch. I've been looking for one for a while and i wasn't willing to pay $500 for the Samsung Gear. It didn't come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation/ use/ set up. Of course is touch screen. It took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens. When you want to dial out the numbers aren't all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times. The volume is kind of low. I wish it was louder (so when driving i could hear the person clearer) however I've been told that i can be heard just fine. Playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone. It does not have a camera you can't verbally write your text messages and i still haven't completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book. All in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price. Play around with the watch for awhile you'll eventually love it. The inside of the band is completely Rubber and I don't sweat which is good. It looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures,0

Took a look and realized the pins for the battery had sheared off. If the seller wants to leave a good impression they will send me another.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01F9PHIM8,CNPGD [U.S. Warranty] All-in-1 Smartwatch…,        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       and still works beautifully. I purchased 8 smartwatches for this Xmas as ...  December 22  2015By Pokerface58,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I don't think it looks cheap at all as some people stated. The directions are awful and not helpful at all. I ended up using SmartWear app downloaded from play store. I have a Galaxy Mega the first large cell phones with a 6.3 inch screen that I purchased in 2013 and still works beautifully. I purchased 8 smartwatches for this Xmas as gifts. I have been reading the comments trying to see if anyone has found a solution for the IPhone which three of the people I gave this watch to have. I gave 4 stars because some of the items on the phone does not operate like the web browser and how do you just put in your sim card and make it work Daaaaaaa! not getting it. Also I accidentally got it to Sync to the BT app lol! I think it would be a great watch if someone would put up a video on how to set it up and make all features work on any phone. Boo on you IPhone you just want people to only use your products with your phones RIGHT! I really like the look of the watch!,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01DZJFYLC,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black…,        634 of 663 people found the following review helpful       Moto G4 Plus 64GB - 4GB RAM  July 13  2016By The_Debrainer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review just some things I've noticed...First of all the build and feel of the phone is very good not super premium like some $600 + phones but its still very good.the fit is tight and uniform no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made.The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage leaving the user with about 54.5 GB.CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAMThe buttons for power and volume feel great make a nice little clicky feel when you push them and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them.the finger print scanner is very useful (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast.I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster.  So far finger print scanner is great way better than i expected.The screen looks great full HD 1080P colors have a warm look to them  the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen.IT is a full 5.5 inch display and yes the buttons are on screen But can go away in certain apps to give you the full screen to use like when watching videos for instance.the sound is very good although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear.Call quality has been excellent and when  calling an iphone 6 about two or three feet away with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback or echoing indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie.The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet.Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant but i will not be testing that for obvious reasons.The camera seems to be great so far low light photos look pretty good and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button it takes photos in rapid succession pretty cool feature.This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun.Some of the cons of this phone i can think of are:No NFC not a big deal to me personally because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC  on past phones for years and never used it except to try it out to see if it worked.No Magnetometer / Compass.  I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are but GPS and navigation still work because they rely on the GPS sensors  this phone also uses GLONASS which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system twice as many satellites means twice the reliability and more accurate and faster positioning.Since there is no Compass google sky map will not work correctly which is big bummer for me.ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE:I live in south Texas and tested this phone outside with the camera app taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors most were about 50 C or below.  also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering.I will update this review if anything changes and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone.EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive.The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting no problems at all.The more I use this phone the more I like it.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01DZJFYLC,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black…,        406 of 437 people found the following review helpful       MOTO G Plus 4th Gen  July 13  2016By John E.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"MOTO G (4th Gen) Plus - 64gb version.  (My old phone is a Samsung Galaxy Note 4).Phone retruned in working order.  Motorola does not even tell you what they did to it.  It took around a week to get it back which is not to bad but they should list what was done to it.  Also the website now lists the device out of warranty which is wrong.  I expect a phone to last 4 years.  So while they fixed it I have zero confidence in moto products.6 Month Update.  From 5 stars to 1 star.  The phone will not charge.  After 6 months that is ridiculous.  These phones should last years. Most likely it is the connection between the cable (tried a bunch) and phone but who knows.  I have done an RMA to Motorola and we will see if they fix it any time soon.  I will update.  If they are prompt the rating will go back up if it takes weeks it will stay a 1.2 Week Update.Screen:  The resolution is excellent.  It is full HD and compares well to my Note 4.  I played with a Note 5 over the 4th and the screen resolution of that is the same.  Yes the Notes have 1440 x 2560 resolution vs the Moto G4s 1080 x 1920 but on a 5.5 inch screen it does not matter.  MOTO has a DPI of 401 which makes the difference unnoticeable.Screen Size.  The MOTO G4 has a 5.25 inch screen.  They list a 5.5 but as the buttons are on the screen you lose .25 inches of screen that you don't on other phones that have physical buttons in the boarder'.  I have found that these disappear when in apps so you get the space back and a simple swipe up brings them back.Android:  Version 6.01.  This is as close to stock Android which is a plus.  There is no bloatware that I could find.  It would be great if it was stock android but it is really tough to get a good stock android phone.  I am hoping that since it is close to stock that updates will come in a timely fashion.  Samsung is the worst for updates.  If you have the latest flagship phone from Samsung you will be lucky if you get the latest android updates after every other company has updated their phones.  Then you have to wait on the carriers who are just as bad.  If you have a phone like my Samsung Note 4 good luck getting updates.  I am hoping MOTO is better at putting out updates but really don't know.  You at least get rid of 1 level by taking out the carrier updates.Battery:  I set the phone up and was using it 100% of the time from about 4:30pm to after midnight and ran the phone down.  I then forgot to plug it in over night and it lost almost no power over night  18% down to 13%.  Charging with included turbo charger:  30 Mins it went from 13% to 47%.  At 1 hour it was at 88%.  it hit 100% at 1 hour 40 mins.After 3 days I would say the battery life is not the best.  If you don't use it it will last forever.  My Samsung Note 4 would be way down with minimal use.  It goes down alot faster with use.  From 7:30 AM to midnight it went from 100% down to 15%.  Most of that when I started using it after work.  I am still playing with settings so this will also be updated.  7:30 to 3:30 I am down to 80% from a full charge.Update:  I have gone through a number of full battery cycle and the battery seems to be holding up well.  I got a day and a half on my last full battery and today I have 66% left from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm.  I am happy if it lasts a day as I will always charge it overnight.  I just don;t want to be on empty at the end of the day and the last few days seem to be holding up.  I still have not tried to optimize anything.After 2 weeks of use I find I have no issues with battery life.  I am very happy with it.Storage.  Android OS on the Moto G4 plus takes 9.49 GB so a 16GB phone is no longer an option.  It really has never been and option.  If you are looking at the 16GB version of the MOTO G4 or the plus keep looking.  This goes for any Android phone. The upgrade to 64gb was only $50 and included an upgrade of memory from 2gb to 4gb.  It is well worth it.  Unlike Apple and Samsung who seem to think you should bend over to have a storage upgrade Motorola comes in with a better price.Micro SD:  I added 128gb card to store music on and it works great.  I have read and suspect it supports up to 256 but those are still cost prohibitive.Finger Print Sensor:  The plus has a finger print sensor that works beautifully.  I have 2 other devices that have finger print sensors.  The Note 4 who's finger print sensor was very poor and was unusable and the Galaxy Tab S2 8"" which seems to function ok. I have had no issue with the MOTO G4 finger print scanner and would rate it superior to either of the Samsung versions I have.App performance:  Everything is very smooth and snappy.  At this point the OCTACore processor and touch of the screen are excellent.  We have gotten to the point when phone CPUs have outpaced need for 95% of the public maybe even 100%.  I don't play high entensity 3d games and those might be an issue but I cannot report on that as everything I use works great.WIFI Performance:  This works fine.  I was getting 50mb a second download off my AC2350 netgear router.  Wired I get 130mb second.  Once again overkill.  I get the same rate from my Samsung Galaxy tab S2 and it supports AC.Look and feel:  The size is great. Just a little smaller in your hand than the Note 4 but it makes a lot of difference.  I have smaller hands and was always fumbling with the note 4.  The MOTO G seems much more natural.No NFC so no Android pay.  I still see absolutely no reason to use android pay so it is not a big deal to me.  I either have to get my phone out and make the payment or I have to get out my wallet and make the payment.  Not a lot of difference.  They tried to solve a problem that didn't exist.  I guess they assume we are all so consumed with with our online presence that our phone is always in our hands.  If you are in line using your phone the person behind you should smack it out of your hands for being rude.Blutooth:  Connected a earbud and my PC.  Both function fine with no issues.Pokemon Go.  Runs fine.  seems to have the same issues as my son and daughters iphone 6 and 6s and my old Samsung Note 4. It is a battery hog on all phones and has to be restarted every once in a while.  These are common to all 4 phones though.Pros.Price: At 299 the 64GB Moto G Plus (4th Gen) is a steal.  It Compares to at least last years flag ship models.Storage:. 64gb is enough for most but if not you can add 128gb micro SD.Screen:  Crystal Clear screen very responsiveSetup: Very easy to setup and install apps from prior phoneApps:  Run perfectly well with no slow downs.  .ConsScreen size of 5.25.  Finger print scanner is not the home button and you waste .25"" of screen for the 3 buttons.Speak is a little tinny.  Fine for voice calls but you would never want to listen to music over it.  earbuds are good and you can always get a set of bluetooth speackers.After 2 weeks I see no reason to buy a Galaxy Note 7 or Iphone 7 for $700 to $800.  You are basically paying $500 for less storage to go from a Great phone camera to the best phone camera and to get NFC.  My daughter who is an Apple iLemming even liked it.  After using it for a week I gave my wife my Note 4 to upgrade her note 2.  This phone is great and I would definitely look at the next one when I need a new phone in a few years.Update 9/16/2016:  I still think this is a great phone and am happy with my purchase.  Much better than spending 700+ on an exploding galaxy note 7.  It does get warm when playing pokemon go and charging at the same time.  Other than that I really have no complaints.  I do think we will see an explosion of 200-300 phones over the next year as people realize that while the flagship lines have better processors those processors are more than they need.  Its like the PC market.  Unless you play heavy duty online games a $400 computer is the same as a  $1000+ computer.",0

May,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After 4 days of continuous use  I really like this phone.  You get a great amount of storage  a good quality screen and performance.  I  am by no means a hardcore  mobile phone gamer.  The most taxing game I play is Fallout Shelter and The Wolf Among Us and this phone loads and plays them without a hitch.  The rest includes streaming music and playing it over Bluetooth at home or in the car  watching YouTube Amazon and Netflix videos. Of course I also talk on the phone and use turn by turn navigation often.  No problems with call quality ringer and speaker volume or with wifi or cellular connections or stability.  Over the past 3 years this is my 4th mobile.  I also currently own a Motorola Moto X Style Pure edition 2015.  It's in the pics for a size comparison.  The Moto X ran me $500 last year and the Moto G4 Plus set me back $325 after some customization at Moto maker.  I like the G4 Plus almost as much as the Moto X  but the X wins on style (G4 is really plain looking) and screen quality.  However for $175 less  the G4 is a great value.  Nice rapid charging too.  More to come in a few weeks. Enjoy the pics.,1

Unlocked - Black…,        15 of 15 people found the following review helpful       Awesome phone  August 1  2016By Tara,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I really like this phone.  It's fast and does everything I need it to do.  I am a heavy cell user : emailing  texting  shopping online  YouTube etc... (Everything except game playing) The signal is great & that says a lot bc I live way out in the country.  (My old cell  LG G4 h815 couldn't hold a signal out here but my Nexus 4 & 5 could) I'm able to use the Hotspot connection as well  but only bc of a tip from another amazon review -  you have to insert the sim card & count to four  then immediately turn on your Hotspot & it works.  If you do it too soon or late  it won't work &  I'm on cricket wireless network  on the unlimited plan. The phone gets a little warm at times but not any more than any other cell I've used.  The turbo charger works awesome - charges faster than any other charger I've used in the past.  So far I'm pleased & pleasantly surprised.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01DZJFYLC,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black…,        118 of 131 people found the following review helpful       First time Android user  it's amazing.  July 22  2016By L. Graham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is the first android phone that I've ever purchased. Have been using iPhone for the past many years. Both myself and my girlfriend. I wanted to updated her phone. Initially was trying to get her the Vivo Blu 5 but it's been out of stock for the past many weeks. Her phone arrived yesterday and just let me say I've already ordered another one for myself which is on the way. I played with her phone a bit to help with the setup since I'm the more techy one. The phone is great super fast. I messed with it for hours and it did not get hot. My iPhone is actually warmer than this. She likes the camera the only thing we could not figure out was where the pictures got stored. Did not know with android you can download any gallery app you want to browse your picture since we are so used to the iPhone. I tested the download speed of huge files and it's super fast I'm very surprised. The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast works every time. You can also use the reader to make purchases in the play store. The reader also activate the home buttons when full screen is running. The phone was already updated when recieved. I thought I would order the one plus 3 for myself but after experiencing hers I was like there is no need. This phone is fully loaded. Paid 299 with a 50 dollar gift card so the actual price is 249 for 64 gigs and 4ram. The phone did not come with any unneeded apps. Oh yea one more thing to add is I'm located in Germany with the armed forces and it works great. Amazon would not ship the black one to my military address so I ordered the white one instead. I'm excited about this phone. Will be watching lots of android videos to get some tips for more ideas to operate it. My only concern is that it does not come with a magnetic compas sensor which my old iPhone had. Not sure what I won't be able to do without the sensor. The phone does not come with ear phone. My girlfriend did not care since we have so many around the house. Another thing to add is the speakers sound great and it's loud. It's in the front of the phone and it sound 3Dish or stereo. I've not used the fm radio will try that today. The phone did not come with a case nor a scratch protector. I did order these things when ordering the phone but it's not yet here. My girlfriend was amazed how light it is. Much lighter than our iPhones. She likes the feel to it but it's kind of slippery without the case. She won't be using it fully yet until the case arrives in dear of our kids getting a hold of it and dropping. That's all I can think of for now. Great phone at a great price. I also ordered the Blu r1 for my daughters birthday. Will review when she opens it next week. Another thing to add for the Moto gplus I thought it was made in India the box says China it also doesn't have manufactured date on the box which I would have liked. You can add multiple fingerprints on the reader.Update:-I figured out that it did have a photo Gallery-The net is much faster on here than on my iphone with using the same SIM Card (its always connected to 4G) No LTE in my part of Germany yet.-The phone heated up one time and that was when we played a high powered game for a long time. I've played other games for hours and it stayed cool. The heat wasn't disturbing though I was only looking for it because of all the reviews.-We now have 2 one for me and the other for my girlfriend they both work the same.-Fingerprint reader is so fast I enabled the option with my banks app and its perfect. I kind of see why it was not a good idea to bring back to the home screen.-Phone calls can sound like its on speaker phone if volume is not low enough.-Volume control on the side is driving me nuts moving it will automatically adjust the volume for the ringtone by default I only want it to control media. Then again this is my first android on my iphone I could lock the speaker volume.-GPS was not working I disabled location services and turned it back on and GPS started to work the signal is so strong and fast. Navigation works any and everywhere.-Downloaded a lot and so much more space left,0

September 16  2016By Big McLargeHuge,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been waiting for years for the inevitable moment when my continual exposure to the microwave radiation emanated by cell phones will give me super powers.Sadly that moment has not come.HOWEVERI live in a somewhat remote area. My Samsung Galaxy S5 would frequently lose signal along my road and I would get a bar or possibly two while at my house. I had the same problem with the Galaxy S4. Ever since I have purchased the Motorola G4 plus I haven't lost signal once and I have almost full bars everywhere in my service area.I did some pretty exhaustive research on unlocked phones and which models would have the strongest antennas and radios. As was my experience back in the pre Android days Motorola makes a solid device and I can see that this trend has continued. I am very pleased with the UI and the general features of the phone but I have to say that as a person who has had a difficult time holding a conversation from his house this phone is a godsend.The absolutely cavernous onboard storage and big fat chunk of memory (4GB; double the normal 2GB)  made it an easy choice over the Nexus phones. The fact that I was able to bring my phone up to 128 gigabytes with the addition of a 64 gigabyte SD card was just icing on the cake.The only real detractor is that now I can't ignore my boss's phone calls and claimed I didn't have signal. So....yeah.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01DZJFYLC,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Affordable 2016 phone that works well and won't break the bank!  September 29  2016By Mark M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My initial impression of the Moto G4 Plus after a few days of use is pretty good.Coming from an older LG G2 one of the first things I noticed is the larger size of 5.5” compared to the smaller 5.2” of the LG. On paper this difference does not seem like much but in real world experience it does make it somewhat more difficult to hold and handle with the Moto. Pulling and storing the Moto in the front pant pocket is more difficult as well but it’s not a deal breaker for me but more of something to get use to as many phones seem to be around the 5.5” size these days.When it comes to grip the matte back of the phone is somewhat grippy but not quite enough for me. I prefer to use a phone without a case but I will be using a case on this phone mainly because of the smooth bezels on the side of the phone which just make it a bit to slippery for daily use. The build quality seems top notch for a phone in the $250-$300 price range. I like that the back cover can easily be pried open for access to the SIM card(micro SIM slot with an included adapter to fit a nano SIM) plus a Micro SD up to 128GB of storage. With the 64GB model there is plenty of space for files music photos apps etc. but it’s nice to see the optional storage made available. It’s a bummer that the battery is non-removable though. The ports(3.5mm and micro usb) are accessible but I would have preferred that the headphone jack was placed on the bottom with the charging port. The screen seems durable with thin bezels on the side perhaps a little too thin for me but not a deal breaker though. There is a slight lip around the screen that allows you to place the phone face-down on a flat surface without concern of scratches.I do like the front-facing speaker at the top which gets very loud at full volume without sounding tinny or crackly when playing audio. However I did notice that the speaker phone did not sound as rich and full when it came to phone calls which is disappointing. The power and volume buttons on the right side are good and clicky with the power button having a textured surface compared to the smooth surface of the volume rocker. The only slight con for me is that the buttons are placed too close to each other and seemed switched in placement compared to many other phones out there. The fingerprint sensor on the front works exceptionally well. It’s accurate and fast. It’s probably twice as fast as my ipad Air 2 sensor. There is almost no delay and works in .5 seconds in my testing. I wish the sensor was placed on the back of the phone perhaps where the Moto emblem dimple is but that is personal preference. One thing to note is that the fingerprint sensor serves no other purpose other than to unlock the phone. I wish Lenovo had built some other features into the fingerprint sensor like other companies have done and they seemed to have scrimped on this.When it comes to Marshmallow 6.0 I’m impressed with the features and with the additional custom hand gesture features for example that Moto brings to the phone. It does seem a little light in custom features compared to what LG has done on their phones though. There is next to no bloatware on the phone which is nice but it does lack some common apps like a calculator and a music player but this can be easily remedied by downloading free apps from the Play Store. Overall the phone operates smoothly while scrolling swiping texting and switching between apps. Texting or swiping on the included Google keyboard app works really well which is a definite plus for me. Multi-tasking on the phone works like a breeze. The Qualcomm 617 octa core processor and 4gb RAM tackles most tasks fairly well for a mid-range processor. Casual gaming works well enough and seems power-efficient thanks to Android 6.0’s power-saving features. The full HD screen is bright and vibrant and works well enough for me. It won’t rival any OLED screen from Samsung or the like but then again it’s less than half the price of those flagship phones so it's not expected to. I’m not sure yet how well the brightness is in broad daylight but I suspect at full brightness it will be sufficient for me. The turbo-charging seems to work well as advertised too.Overall this is a nice 2016 phone with a current OS 32GB storage 4GB RAM speedy processor full HD screen timely security updates Android N upgrade-able and is virtually free of bloatware. At the $250-$300 price range this is really a no-brainer for a budget to mid-range phone and should be on any person’s shopping list. With only a few minor cons for me I still recommend the Moto G4 Plus for anyone looking for an affordable phone. 4.5/5 stars.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01DZJFYLC,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       If you loved the Nexus 5 - This is your phone!  August 25  2016By RSD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Just an update after using a few months. This is a great no frills phone. It fits well in hand and I have actually found I like it day to day better than my LG V10.If you loved the Nexus 5 this is a phone for you.This is a really good phone with the caveat ""for the money"".  And that probably isn't a fair thing to say. It works great and feels good in the hand and is smooth has an excellent camera and just runs well. It is unlocked and works with no problems on my T-Mobile 4G LTE network. Never owned a Moto phone.  Have always purchased the carrier phones with the exception of an alcatel 3s I bought for one of my family members.  I think if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive option to the $ 600 to $900 devices this is a good option. It is missing some features I've liked in the past like ""knock"" to wake or shut off the screen.I originally purchased an Alcatel 4s during pre-order but it would not play well with T-Mobile 4G LTE.  I actually liked the features and screen of the 4s better than this Moto G phone but it was slippery. And they were about the same price.It does not have a lot of cool features or added apps but it works well which some people will like.  Pretty much a Google phone although I've added some things I like and that is the beauty and fun of the Android world.The camera is great - and takes much better pics than the Alcatel 4S.and has really given my LG V10 a run for its money. Pictures are accurate software works fast quick pics turn out well.Speaker is average but it does face forward and that makes it clearer sounding and not as easily covered by your hand.The battery life this week seems to be very good and idle management works well with 6.01.  Gets me thru a full day without charging and the fast charge gets it charged up as advertised.Call quality has been excellent but I did notice that the volume was not as loud as my V10 or 4S. Hopefully they can issue an update that will make the call volume a little louder. all other apps and music are plenty loud. Wifi and LTE the same. No NFC which is weird.Phone feels good in hand and isn't difficult to operate one handed unlike my V10. and they make a lot of nice cases already including the Diztronic and the BENTOBEN 2 Piece case (this is a great case for the MOTO G) - many more good case choices than the Alcatel. Also glass screen protector from Mr. Shield is super. Went on perfect and adds a nice feel to the Moto G screen.Finger print scanner is quick and responsive but I wish the scanner also turned off the screen. It sits in a great place and I am used to the integrated scanner on the V10 that turns off and wakes the phone.No stuttering or problems with performance.  I think the 4gb RAM and 64 gb on board storage help.The phone does get hot occasionally when I'm uploading or downloading files so I'm going to watch that.  I've read the stories about camera video overheat but haven't taken a lot of lengthy video.This device has some stiff competition in that price range including the One Plus 3 and Axxon 7. Both about $100 more but much more robust specs.It reminds me a bit of the original Nexus 5. Affordable  clean  unlocked and likes pure Android (with a few Moto features left in the mix)  And just does what it's supposed to.with a much better camera more memory/storage options and much better battery life.Would recommend this device to people that are looking for quality brand at a very fair price with no frills /no bloat phone that works well on any network has good battery life easy to charge huge storage nice screen excellent camera good in hand and is at an excellent price point.",0

I have activated finger scanned lock so when I am not using it I lock it with the button which is on the right side on the edge or the power key if that's what it is called  so after that when I unlock it at the time when I want to use  sometime it doesn't work means like it is unlock and I can see what's I. The screen but I can't use anything like when I am texting someone the cursor can be moved but the texting pads the alphabets it stops working . Then again I have to press the power key again to lock it and unlock again then it comes to normal .  And one more thing I haven't received head jack with it,1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B014GCG1BE,Samsung Galaxy J5 SM-J500H/DS GSM…,        101 of 105 people found the following review helpful       Great phone that I would buy again  January 20  2016By Platinum44,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Overall the phone is perfect for what I needed. I looked at everything locally from the  Samsung Galaxy Core Prime to the iPhone 6s. This is my first smart phone and data plan.  I upgraded from a 6 year old Motorola Quantico flip phone.  I couldn’t find what I wanted and I checked with my provider for compatibility and decided to order the GSM Samsung J5 factory unlocked international version because it had the features I wanted.SHIPPING: While browsing the website I found there were shipping restrictions on new cell phones due to the batteries. Amazon wouldn’t ship outside the continental 48 states (Amazon wouldn’t ship via air) so I had the phone shipped to a location I was going to visit in Washington State.  I got a sim card from my local cell phone provider (not a large national company) before I left home and when the phone arrived I was there to receive it.  BlutekUSA was the seller and Amazon fulfilled the order.  I ordered it on 12/31/15.  It arrived 3 days earlier than the estimate via UPS Ground from Virginia and was 7 days in transit.SETUP/USE: It was new in a factory sealed box and after setting the language from Hindi to English installing the sim card and setting the APN (access point name) everything worked as it should in Seattle and later back home in Alaska.  The APN setting can happen automatically but it didn’t for me.  I don’t expect to be a heavy user but I tested most of the features.  The processor is fast enough for running the available apps and the phone has a high resolution screen for photos video and web browsing.  With a fast cellular or Wi-Fi connection Netflix loaded really fast and ran in great looking HD.  The front camera pictures are very good 13 MP and the internal storage 8 GB is sufficient for me.  I added a 32 GB SD card but it can accept up to a 128 GB micro SD.  I recommend looking at videos and the quick start or online manual so you know what you’re getting and where to install the sim or sims (it will accept 2 sim cards for 2 phone lines) and micro SD memory inside the back cover of the phone.,0

April 5  2016By melannie @ Books Are Vital,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am one of those people who is not into paying exhorbitant amounts of money for a phone. All of my previous phones have been my siblings hand me downs and this is the first I ever purchase for myself. Me being me I researched everywhere for what kind of phone will serve my purposes. Mostly I was aming for excellent camera that could photograph everything I have to show my coworkers later and also had a great reception for making and receiving calls in all seven floors of the hospital.This phone delivered.Not only am I super please with its performance at almost everything but I am amazed that one such phone can cost this price. And it has a high end finish and the gold color make it look amazing. Compared to my sister's iPhone 6 I'd say it almost does everything she can do with hers. It's light and sophisticated and has a quick response at everything I've done so far. Even better than hers is that this one holds two SIMs which works perfectly with my life as I love to travel. So far I've tested two of my international SIMs and they both worked great.It's also my first android phone ever as I'd previously only used the iOS softwares I was expecting a nightmare. It wasn't. It wasn't also exactly breezy but the phone is not to blame for that. Also I was pleasently surprised with the amount of apps you can get.The only thing though is get an SD card. No matter how little you think you need it you're going to need it.,0

I was satisfied that it looked and functioned like new EXCEPT for one major thing. The battery only charges to 60%. I've been charging this phone overnight and that is the maximum capacity of charging. The battery is is defective which sucks because what's the point of having a phone that lasts only a couple hours?UPDATE: The phone does to 100% but charging time is much slower than expected. Especially having a lag-time of 6 hours overnight. Also during the beginning of charge the phone discharged more than it charged. Hopefully this is just a battery issue and not the phone itself. I'm still confused on how this happened but it looks like it is charging fine now.In terms of the phone itself some issues to look for:Camera: It does not automatically let you use panorama mode. Only a few options were available and you have to ""reset settings"" in the camera function to access that and other modes as well. I always have to reset it if I want to use those modes.Memory: The device has only 8 GB so definitely make sure you have an extra micro SD. I've only installed 3 apps--NPR Skype and Line--and it says that I've already used 2/3 of full storage.The product also says that there is a 24 month warranty but after thoroughly reading the manual it does not seem applicable to the USA.",0

The phone isn't ""refurbished""- it's broken and unusable.I like the look and feel of the phone but it has *many* issues. I was upgrading from a 5s and the 6 seems like a great pick but this seller clearly is just turning over broken phones and not doing the whole ""refurbishing"" part...The first issue is that applications keep crashing while I’m using it. This isn’t constant but it’s happened multiple times with various games/browsers so I don’t like that.Another thing that’s even more annoying is that the volume doesn’t switch off. It pops back up to full volume immediately or on its own randomly. Even when it IS in the mute position the phone makes noise when getting texts or taking a photo. I stopped by the Apple store to make sure I wasn’t confused and the Genius Bar woman was concerned and confused as well. She said if the volume is switched to off the camera shutter should *not* make noise yet it does. This is a nightmare at work when getting emails and texts. It's very loud and annoying and this is embarrassing. It doesn’t stay in the mute position it constantly slides back up. But even while it’s still in the mute position it doesn’t mute the sounds.There is a new problem as of today which is that it keeps saying my sent texts are undelivered with the red exclamation but then people respond to them. So I never know if something went through or not.The final thing that’s been “off” is that the screen sometimes gets wavy which I’ve never experienced before in a phone. The first time this happened I was taking a photo through a window so I didn’t think about it much and just assumed it was something to do with the glass. But it’s happened a few times now while I’m texting or on Facebook. I don’t even know why it would do thisI was expecting a used but perfect condition phone. This one clearly has some issues and it’s not functioning as promised.",0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCVA,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        136 of 147 people found the following review helpful       Incredible Device  October 23  2016By Logan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This phone is incredible. I don't mean ""incredible for the price"" which then implies that if you spend more money you'll automatically get a better device. I mean incredible full stop. I have only purchased ""high-end"" devices in the past I've tried iPhones expensive androids and even a Windows phone that was quickly replaced (there's just no app support on Windows). I currently own a Sony Xperia Z5 that I paid nearly $600 for. This $200 phone performs better than that so called ""high end"" device. Money does not matter anymore it's getting cheaper to make full-featured phones. Specs matter the hardware matters and the value that you're getting matters. Anyway here's my review:The battery life on this device is impressive. It's not an exaggeration to say that you can get a few days of heavy use between charges. The display is large pin sharp bright and beautiful. Colors are rendered very well on this device.I have absolutely no complaints about the camera and in fact I think it has a few features that should be standard on more devices. The sensor is actually a Sony sensor which may explain why I love the camera so much I'm a longtime fan of the Xperia line. There is a professional mode that allows you to manually focus your shots in addition to controlling the shutter speed iso and white balance. That's pretty cool and there are not a lot of phones that will allow that. The slow motion video is a little choppy but usable it's no worse than the slow motion on my aforementioned Sony phone. The time-lapse video feature is crazy useful the time-lapse camera has always been my favorite Xperia app so I was excited to see it on this device. There are a few more gimmicky camera modes like mood shot (a polaroid maker with quick filters) and gif mode that are fun to play around with. The low light performance  in auto mode isn't anything to write home about BUT the night shot mode does a great job so if you're in low light just switch to that and you'll be good to go. I added a photo of pumpkins that I took in night mode the only light sources were the tea-light candles inside the pumpkins. There's one more camera mode that I loved mega-pixel or perfect-pixel or something that takes a photograph 300 times the size of a regular shot. This is useful for zooming in you can crop into the larger image instead and retain the image quality.This phone has both a rear and front-facing flash yet another feature my $600 phone does not have. The rear-facing speaker is my biggest sticking point with this phone it detracts from the clean design of the back of the phone and of course makes listening to audio without headphones or an external speaker more challenging but I don't care very much about the built in speakers on my phones so it's not a major concern. The fingerprint scanner is great. I love the placement and I love that it's just a scanner and not a button. The phone looks expensive and feels nice in the hand. It's very lightweight.I would definitely recommend purchasing this device I don't regret the money I spent on phones in the past because cheap phones used to be...well..cheap but moving forward I will be buying more phones from Blu.",1
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCVA,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        12 of 12 people found the following review helpful       This phone is a tank!!!  January 30  2017By Anthony S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So first off I'm hard on my phone's absolutely horrible to them. I originally owned a Blu studio 5.0 and it was trash to say the least but hey review is not about that it's about the Vivo 5R. So first impression it's quite large however it's similar in size to the Moto X and LG Optimus G pro speaking from experience as I owned these before the Vivo as well. Competing with these is not difficult for the Vivo 5R I feel the clock speed for the processor may be underrated due to the fact that it is faster next to it's flagship cousins (dare I say cousins). The RAM is perfect for moderate to heavy usage I have yet to see the phone link or slow from large apps running. Next the screen it is a tad sharper than the Moto and a yard more colorful than the LG. Battery life one word astonishing. I stream music from YouTube while I'm at work unhealthy for the data but on low brightness I can easily get 10 hours of constant YouTube before I need to consider a charger. Storage 32gb as well as an SD card forget Apple. And last but not least strength and durability. This phone has surpassed my expectations. The following is not exaggerated this phone has been thrown dropped kick slid and stepped on. It has landed on carpet asphalt concrete gravel snow and slush. It has gotten water splashed on it and slush and snow in the charging and headphone ports everything is still working perfectly. But there is only one reason I am buying another one. On this day I am writing a review to state that this phone is indeed a tank earlier I accidentally shut the phone in my car door hard to explain but it was an accident. The phone came out functioning with no problem the frame and screen are bent the glass DID NOT crack the bend runs under the fingerprint scanner and it still works. I am writing this review on the phone itself. So all in all well worth the $200 if not more especially considering the only reason I'm buying another is I don't want to work with a bent phone so other than the before mentioned asthetic issue it's a perfect phone for the fast paced but rough user!,0

Unlocked Cell Phones,B01J88GCVA,BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone…,        14 of 15 people found the following review helpful       A few things corrected and this would have been a 'love it' phone  November 10  2016By DevB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have had the BLU VIVO 5R for a month now. I wanted to use it for some time before I penned my review in an attempt to make it as objective as possible.Ok to start off: It is a nice big phone pretty sleek and with a passable finish. A few people have asked me ""which phone?"" the answer has mostly left them with a ""?"" on their face. So clearly BLU is not a very popular phone in the US market.Personally I went for BLU coz the specs looked impressive on paper; and I did not want to spend a lot for similar specs from a flagship manufacturer. My honest view is that its a OK phone I can't really say i LOVE it and nor can I say I HATE it. Although the thought of returning it did cross my mind.Most important difference for any Samsung users the badge notifications for any new WhatsApp or SMS or missed calls - this feature is absent. As I learnt it after researching this was a Samsung feature that they apparently copied from Apple. But I have failed to reason why Android does not have this feature built-in. There are a number of skins that claim to enable this functionality but I was unable to get any of the skins working. I have now just surrendered - and am being forced to getting used to seeing these notifications only in the notifications bar.The auto brightness control/feature while present is questionable. I have often felt that the default brightness that it auto-adjusts is often lower than ideal required - thus requiring you to manually tweak it often.The camera: while the pictures look better than some of the other models the pictures don't seem to have the sharp edges when we zoom in. So camera is OK but not really as good as the promise. One serious drawback the moment you attempt to start the camera app say when the battery is 15-18% it just flashes a warning that battery is low and camera cannot be operated and the phone just shuts down! Totally weird! A phone with 3000mah battery switches off at 15% and prevents camera usage!The battery: I use my phone a lot for calls and then some for whats app and text messages. The battery is good not great; but will run a day. The only issue however I felt is that it takes forever to charge the battery.Fingerprint sensor: It is nice and I think this is the only feature that this model had which I was tempted to go for. Another smart feature is that it give multiple options to unlock the phone. viz. if you are at home or face recognizition or few others.Call quality: It is ok though I noticed I often need to keep the volume to max. Also weird thing when I am on call the phone locks after the usual 30 or 45 secs inactivity and then when I have to conference or use any other feature. I first need to go to home screen; unlock with my finger and then get back to phone app and then try conferencing. This just adds a 5 - 10 second delay - which irritates me a bit.It has got 3 GB RAM plus oct core. So speed of operation is not an issue.All in all its a good buy if your expectations are average+ and you have a tight budget. But if you can live with above shortcomings its probably a very good phone for you.",0

I can't remove and Blu is not providing assistance.  Don't buy their phones they don't have the infrastructure like Apple and Samsung that is needed to update the OS and keep our info safe.11/2016 Love this phone everyone who sees it oohs and aahs. When they see see ""BLU"" on the back of the phone they are thoroughly confused.  I am one of the early converts to cutting cords and contracts for cable and phone and anything else. This phone is high high quality and the price is not cheap it is simply how much a phone is supposed to cost. Especially when you know technology changes and you will scratch your tech itch in another 2 years. Their phones come with everything you need including a screen protector and a phone cover that will not hide the cool sealed metal handset. The fingerprint recognition is much better than my Samsung Galaxy ever was. It's not buggy takes good pictures smoothly plays videos call volume and call quality is excellent. Thanks to Google seamless transition of apps and contacts.Cons- That being said I have played with it for a month and there are 3 issues. I have downloaded security software to monitor my web activity. When I set this as a default action in settings (hard to locate too) the system will ignore what I have done and turn off my changes. 2nd issue I use cast at times to show websites on my TV through Roku. This option at times simply does not work.  This being said the cause could be because it uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as an operating system. While other providers have updated patches BLU has not. I have no idea if my phone will even contemplate upgrading to 7.0 Nougat. The lack of updates could be a major no go for some consumers. Also I hate the ugly finger shaped emoji and wish I didn't have to download an ad riddled app for more choices.",0

My Nexus 5X ended up with a cracked screen and I was torn between having it fixed for $100 at the mall or getting a new cheap phone to last me until the Pixels get some rebates.I was not totally happy with the 5X (the 2GB of RAM just killed the package) so I ended up looking at phones around the $200 and there were not too many that I felt torn between. It came down to the Vivo 5R and an Asus one. What swayed me towards the Vivo was the location of the fingerprint reader (just like on the 5X) the described battery life and the gist of the reviews mostly. It just felt like this would require not too much change in my habits of using the phone.2) Initial impression  My initial impression was highly positive (that would have been 5 stars for sure). The phone looked and felt nice it came with a bumper case an applied screen protector and headphones (which I haven't tried) and I was quite happy. I couldn't restore my settings/apps from my 5X due to the Vivo running on Marshmallow but it didn't take me long to get everything set up. So in short great job Blu!3) Getting used to it  From the start I was amazed by the battery - this phone really lasts a day even with heavy use. I've used it as a hotspot for a full working day did calls messages email during that time and it was not empty at night. Or on another measure more than 4.5 hrs of Pokemon go (about twice as long as on the 5X). The fingerprint reader works great fast and precise and the screen is crisp and bright. Great! Also the 3GB of RAM mean that even though the CPU is not the fastest apps seem faster than in the 5X because they don't have to be loaded from scratch almost every time. Quite a nice phone up to this point.But then I got to the first thing that I wasn't so happy with: the camera. Coming from the 5X and having used that phone's camera exclusively on vacations and gotten great pictures I was expecting a downgrade but not as much of one as I received. The camera is pretty bad not really good for anything beyond the occasional snapshot where you don't care about the quality. In anything but the brightest light the pictures are always fuzzy oddly enough usually looking much better on the screen when you take them than in the actual picture that's saved. That's the first star that's coming off my rating. I didn't expect a top-of-the-line camera but one that would have been good 3 or 4 years ago... Another thing you have to get used to is seeing the software status of... well whenever they chose to last update it. It was ""June 2016"" a couple of weeks ago. Given how frequently Android receives updates you really have to decide if you're happy with a phone that's half a year behind the guys trying to take over your device. I understand that that's one of the reasons the phone is so cheap but it's an issue that's slightly bothersome. So that's the next star that comes off.4) And service?  Service is as can be expected I think. My phone started continuously booting after 6 weeks and after a short email exchange with Blu support I got an RMA # and my phone is now on the way to their Florida office. It's a bring-in warranty and that's fine. I'm expecting it to be gone for at least 4 weeks maybe 5 depending on how they ship it back.In short: It's a good phone for $200 if you don't need the camera much and stay away from fishy websites that are trying to plant malware on your device in short.The screen the battery and the performance will certainly not disappoint you if you're shopping in this price-range.(And yes I'm back on my 5X after I had the screen fixed at the mall and it does feel much slower than the Vivo thanks to the insufficient RAM)",0

January 16  2017By G. Laszlo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This one I bought for my wife I have an LG G4. I feel this one is a bit faster than the LG the screen is perfect and the best advantage is that it can stay alive without charging for about 48 hours. The settings is not as detailed as in the other one and I just realized there is no NFC chip in it. But it comes with a screen protector and a cover the fingerprint scanner works pretty good. For this much it is a perfect buy.,0

The first 2 were the Studio Energy 2 and those phones were very sturdy as well as dependable. This phone not so much. This phone has issues and I will not go into all of them but I will say the main two that made me return mine. First off when making a call the phone would just reset back to DOS mode or Android mode. It would say Android needs a password to reboot. Five minutes later I would be able to dial the number. The second issue that tops my list the speaker was horrible. It would be louder for music but scratchy and then too low for the ringer and notifications. I see more people are having the speaker issue as well so back it goes. NO the plastic was not left on it. This is how they are trying to explain away the issue on other phones they sell as well. This way the potential buyer thinks Oh buyer mistake. This is not the case on most.Also no thanks to amazon for holding back my shipment. Took over a week for 2 day shipping. Zero stars to Amazon for that.,0

December 28  2016By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I really love Blu phones because of their prices and quality (not big deal but good enough). This phone looks beautiful. I specially love size the camera and screen quality but I don't recommend it at all. This phone comes with charging problems. Just had it for about a month when it started to not even recognize the charger and when it used to it didn't charge more than 40-50%. I had it plugged in for more than 12 hours and still did not charge to 100%. It was a waist of money going to Blu products' workshop and still the phone is having issues. I went online and it seems to be a common issue with this model. Totally disappointed.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01AHZUT0S,"BLU Vivo XL Smartphone - 5.5"" 4G LTE…",        45 of 50 people found the following review helpful       The best bang for the buck.  July 5  2016By Edgar Reyes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is one of the best BLU phones that ive used so far it is super fast the screen is amazing even with the sun above the screen you can still use it obviously not crystal clear but not such a big deal.The battery is what I love the most it charged super fast and lasts a whole day (7am - 11pm) of moderate use with about 30-25% remaining battery.I have it with a 32gb class 10 micro SD that does not use the second SIM slot to work as seen in previous model and gives me no problema whatsoever.The only thing I would complain is about the camera in low light conditions.If you plan on using this phone to take tons of pictures share them over the social networks it might not be as efficient in low light. Is not bad but my vivo Air was better camera wise.If you are looking for a phone to browse the web or social networks listen some music watch videos movies or whatever you do with your phone like making calls it works flawlessly.Also the sound and volumen of the speaker is amazing clear and loud.Buy it try it love it.I shared some photos with sunlight and low light so you can see for yourself the differebce between them.Hope it helps you to take a better decision.,1

Three of us in my neighborhood purchased this model at abut the same time last summer and all of them are doing the same thing. I contacted Blu and they will not honor their warranty since it was an open box. I liked the phone until it and a the others owned by friends started doing this. I will not buy another.,0

January 18  2017By john castillo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,If I could leave zero stars for this product I would. I will forever advise against anyone purchasing a BLU product especially after their abhorrent customer service.The charger ceased to work after a month I.e. past the time that Amazon would cover it so I emailed them. It took them two days to reply and by that time I had given in and bought a charger (which by the way is a USB-C. I'm well aware that they're trying to move the industry in that direction as opposed to the current standard the micro-USB but at the moment local retailers do not sell them and when they do they are $20+).This time I thought the charger had given out spent $25 on a new charger which wasn't charging my phone. Checked it on another charger that definitely worked on other devices did not work on my phone. I emailed their customer service again because I could not call from a broken phone that wasn't charging and wouldn't even turn on. They emailed me back two days later again with a form to complete online and a technician would contact me. I later received an email detailing how to do a hard reset--with a phone that won't even charge or turn on?Needless to say their products are inferior the company is not dedicated to keeping their promises despite a warranty covering the product (it is well within the six month warranty coverage) and the customer service and technicians are largely uncaring and unattentive. I will be surprised if they let me send in my phone.,0

July 17  2016By KJ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I received this phone almost two months ago and I absolutely loved it. It runs smoothly and quick enough for me. I have an extra SD card on it because I have some large file games on it and tons of pictures. I love the emoji art and tons of emoticons available. I began having trouble with it charging yesterday. I have contacted customer service through email and plan on calling tomorrow. I will give an update as soon as I know more. My previous phone was a BLU and I loved it too. It lasted me two years and I paid $120 for it. I was very pleased with it. I was very pleased with the Vivo XL also. Beautiful graphics quick charging and smooth running. Hopefully I just got a bad one and the matter will be resolved soon. Due to the bad reviews about customer service I will update my experience soon. It took about two weeks to send my phone off and they sent me a new one!  Love this phone!,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01AHZUT0S,"BLU Vivo XL Smartphone - 5.5"" 4G LTE…",        12 of 13 people found the following review helpful       Not happy...  July 27  2016By Miranda Heinrich,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I ordered the first phone 2 months ago. That phone now will not charge. The second phone or replacement phone I ordered a month ago. That phone refuses to connect to my unlimited data plan or wifi. I know I need to return one if the phones to the company but at this point I'd prefer a total refund. I'm using the first phone to do phone things and the second phone to charge both the batteries for the first phone. I bought this phone knowing it was an American company and hoping for better results than anything I've had in the past. Instead it's pushed me far away from ever buying this type of phone again. Highly unrecommended.Update: it's now January 2017 and I've had the phone 6 months. I've used protection on it and suddenly the battery won't charge or the screen turn on. It's just like throwing $150 on the ground and being totally screwed.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01AHZUT0S,"BLU Vivo XL Smartphone - 5.5"" 4G LTE…",        10 of 11 people found the following review helpful       The little phone that could  August 26  2016By B. Baldwin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So let me tell you a story about the little phone that could.  Seriously though I do have a story to tell…Several months ago I heard about the upcoming release of the OnePlus 3 phone.  After all my reading I had my heart set on one.  I ordered one on the first day and went around for the next two months proudly showing it off to anyone who would listen.  Until I picked it up 2 months after I bought it and it had died.  It wouldn’t turn on for the life of me and I tried everything.  After anticipating several days of back and forth with OnePlus support after my initial call I decided to get a “burner” phone to fill the gap while I went through the process of getting my phone replaced.  I still wanted the 5.5” screen and happened upon this phone so I bought one thinking I’d use it for a couple of weeks and sell it on eBay.  Well it did in fact take about 2 weeks for my OnePlus to be repaired and it that time I’ve fallen in love with my little Blu phone and have actually decided to sell the OnePlus 3 and keep this phone.I’m not an Android Power User (read my phone isn’t rooted) but I push it pretty hard and use it for a lot.  The Blu Vivo XL hasn’t missed a beat!  For what I can tell it works as fast as the OnePlus 3 with a top of the line snapdragon processor and 6GB of ram!  I haven’t experienced any lag the interface is very fluid and if you pop a nova launcher on the phone it becomes VERY useable!  I lost every picture on my OnePlus 3 as it was the motherboard that fried however the Blu lets me sleep at night knowing that all my images are safely on an SD card (which is now backed up on a regular basis).  The screen is crisp and every bit as good as any phone I’ve ever had and I for one can’t tell the difference at all between 720 and 1080 until I’m so zoomed in on a photo that it’s ridiculous.  The battery life is amazing even better than the OnePlus that was running Marshmallow I’m guessing due to the lower resolution.  I can easily get through a day of moderate use and still have 20-30% power at the end of the day.  The phone feels great in my hand is just the right size and weight and has some really fun features built into it (I keep getting pleasantly surprised as I explore more).Add a 32GB card for $11 to this phone and you should have plenty of storage for all your needs.I can’t tell you how pleased I am with this phone  my wife is now buying the Vivo 5 as she likes mine so much (but wants to outdo me with more ram and metal case).  If you’re on the fence take a chance I’m sure you’ll be very happy!!!,0

It was been about a month that I have been having issues with charging the phone.  It would take a long time to charge and I had to hold the cables a certain way for the phone to charge. I bought an expensive cable from Best buy to make sure that it was the phone and not the cable that was causing the charging issues.  The  charging port kept disconnecting and not holding a charge. Any movement slight movement of the phone would stop the charging and the phone would think the charger had been removed. I've tried multiple chargers and a factory reset of the phone none of which has helped. .  I have contact BLU through their website. I will update once I get this resolve.Update:  10/11/2016Blu will be sending me a replacement phone at no additional cost to me.This is my second BLU phone and it is the first time I have had an issue.,0

Charger it came with quit working after 2 weeks so had to replace. It froze up a couple times a day. I purchased this phone in September. Used it for 2months. One day the phone did a software update and since then it doesn't work I power it off pulled the battery charged it and every time it powers up the screen flashes to an error message that I'm supposed to click something to correct it yet I am never able to actually click it because it keeps flashing on and off the screen so quickly it's ridiculous... 2 months this phone worked out for me. Not impressed.Using for just under a week now. I have always used Straight Talk literally all I had to do was put my straight talk simcard in this phone and that was it. I like it. Nice display nice photo quality nice phone calling and texting. At this point I have no complaints.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MT13NNB,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        206 of 210 people found the following review helpful       Honor next budget friendly phone. How does is it compare to the 5x?  January 14  2017By Bbta,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Update:I am changing the review to 5 stars. After few more days of use: the 6x clearly outranks the 5x in design (which is growing on me) WiFi and cell reception performance and battery life.Honor 5x was the first true “budget” smart phone. Metal design and fingerprint sensor where rarely seen on any phone with close price tag at that time are becoming more and more standard now. That being said that device had some shortfalls. The performance with the snapdragon was lacking under pressure and the EMUI android skin is not everybody’s cup of tea. Today we look at the true successor of the Honor 5x with similar price tag. How did the devices rank against each other? And are the differences worth the extra $80 or so? (Both available on Amazon now for $249 vs $169)Un-boxing and accessoriesPretty standard boxes with nothing fancy for both. Accessories much easier to find for 5x but 6x is just launched so I am sure it will catch up. Not much to talk about here.DesignBoth are gorgeous. I had the gold Honor 5x and now compared to the gray Honor 6x they both look way much more premium than their price tag. You could easily mistake them for a $600 phone. That being said the Honor 6x is more round around the edges has more mate finish on the back (both has aluminum body) and feels more comfortable to hold. Honor did improve the design but not much. Honor 6x still is marginally better.Processor RAM and performanceHonor 5x had the more widely known Snapdragon 617 while Honor opted for the in house Kirin 655. Honor 5x had 2 GB of RAM and 6x has 3 GB (in USA anyway). On paper the Kirin outperforms the Snapdragon (it is actually more in line with Snapdragon 625-650). This is confirmed by multiple benchmark tests although I will not bore you with the details (easily obtainable by googling both processors). Kirin also seems more power efficient thanks to the more semiconductor size (28 nm vs 16 nm) which should translate into more less heat generation as well. How did this translate into real life performance? Both devices perform well for everyday use. You will notice a slight hiccups here and there for the honor 5x particularly when opening apps (Google maps seems to take few seconds) and this becomes more prominent when you install more apps (I had 100+ apps installed). The 6x seems to handle this much better. The lag is almost non-existent and apps open up quickly (even google maps! I hated those extra seconds of waiting on 5x when checking traffic in the morning before I head to work – no more with 6x!). Is it the new processor? Is the extra RAM? Being an in house chipset optimized more to work with the user interface? Or is it simply that devices become slower with time and the 6x will follow lead? Could be any of those but for the time being I have to go with the 6x as a winner!One last word: my only concern regarding the 6x is the GPU (which handles the display and 3d part gaming mostly). The GPU on the 5x is Adreno 405 – no match for much better GPUs in today’s flagships but performs OK and tried in and out. The Mali T830MP2 is not as much. They both seem to handle things comparably now but will see how the Mali handles games released a year or two from now.ScreenBoth are gorgeous. Is this the best screen around? No. but for practical purposes both did great with a small edge for the 6x colors seems more accurate. However for the price range they may be the best you can get and it looks amazing for watching a movie or displaying pictures. Given the slightly higher price tag for he 6x I would say this is a tie.CameraBoth perform adequately. Both are poor in low light situations. Both will take OK pictures. Did the two lens format in the 6x make a huge difference? In my personal opinion no. The second Camera is not a monochrome camera like you see in pricier phones and mostly functions to give that nice background blurring but not much more. This seems odd as the two lens format seems to be a selling point to Honor but the phone has more to offer anyway. This is a tie.SoftwareThis is where it gets messy. You will always hear bad things about EMUI. Let me get out of the way: It is not as bad as people make it look like. It is just different. It is somewhere in the middle of Android and iPhone and I think it took some nice features from both (I like that you can search for apps simply by swiping the home screen down like you can do on iOS). You still get the customizations of android you get the widgets and you get the ability to run 3rd party launcher (Nova launcher seemed to make my honor 5x faster). But it is not stock android. If you like android as it is do not go for this one. If you don’t mind Honor tweaks then I think you will do fine with both. For what it is worth I think the EMUI is one of the best android skins to prevent battery drains – it seems well optimized.As far as comparing the two devices: while it is disappointing that Honor 6x launched with EMUI 4 on android M we are promised an update to Android N with EMUI within weeks. Honor kept their word re updating the 5x from android 5 to 6 so hopefully they will keep their track record.This is also a tie.BatteryHonor 5x best selling point for me was the battery. No it will not last 2 days 3 days or longer. No you will not get 10 hours of screen on time. But that is not what I am looking for in a phone. I am looking for a phone that can give me few hours (3-5 at least of screen on time) to check my emails and browse internet may be the occasional game or two and not drain itself to death when I am not using it. Basically I want a phone I can use moderately with no need to charge mid day. You would think this is easy to get but to me it was not. I tried several phones at this price range and higher since my nexus 4 died. I tried Lg g2 xperia z1 and z2 nexus 6p (yes) note 4 and Axon 7. They all had one issue or the other. My biggest problem that I do not get good reception in my work area where I spend several hours a day and this seems to suck the life out of every battery I tried. My phone would go from 100 in the morning to 40 or so while not being used but rarely. Not with Honor 5x. I finally would be able to go home with 50 – 60% + when I get home with moderate usage and 2-3 hours screen on time. It may be the software or the way honor handles the bad reception but that was why I stuck with the 5x for a year. Honor 6x seems to follow lead as well and I have no issues using it for 2 days with light use. It also lacks true quick charging but it charged to 100% in about two hours. At the price range I really do not care about the extra 30 min it seems to take when compared to say Axon 7 which took me around an hour and a half to fully charge. So far both devices perform well. A slight edge for honor 6x.MiscellaneousThey both have fingerprint scanner. For all intents and purposes is it excellent and it does not get much better than this. I cannot remember last time I had to try more than once to open the device. It works while screen is off (unlike older Samsung models where screen had to be turned on manually first). The honor 6x sensor is faster than the 5xBoth are fully compatible with T mobile and AT and T. LTE is excellent: I get around 10-15 mg download speed in a major metro area. It does have band 12 on t mobileBoth have double sim the second sim doubles as an SD card slot in both6x is reported to have an IR port but I am unable to get it to work yet! no built in remote control app.Both have the much more available USB 2 for a charger. While this may become problematic years from now for the time being to me this an advantage. You can use any old android charger with no need for adaptersVerdictThis is an excellent phone. I am really happy that so called mid-range phones are getting better and better each year. It will not disappoint you and will perform more than adequately for everyday use and then some more. After few more days of use the much better battery life design and performance easily justifies the price difference. Good work Huawei!,1

January 28  2017By Jenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am a recent iPhone convert. I have worked in the mobile industry for years and always look for a phone that will give me bang for my buck. This phone completely fits the bill. The display is crisp the photo quality is excellent the ability to add memory invaluable. It does lag sometimes but not so bad that I'm ready to throw it out the window. I love the fingerprint sensor by the time my phones at my face it's unlocked and ready to go. The FM radio is a great bonus too. I just received it yesterday and am activating it on AT&T's prepaid plan. I'm looking forward to seeing how the phone's service runs - I'm sure I'll be pleasantly surprised.,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MT13NNB,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Camera  Amazing Battery Life  and overall Top-Tier Budget Device!  February 21  2017By Thomas-Hintzel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I switched to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy Edge S6. This may seem like a massive downgrade for some folks but I am actually enjoying the Honor 6X more than the Edge S6 which I'll explain below in my comprehensive review.Body/Form-Factor (4/5):The Honor 6X isn't anything really spectacular to look at but it feels durable and nice in the hand. It's aesthetic is decently pleasing to me. I do not enjoy phones that are trying to be overly flashy or fancy (mainly because I put a case on them anyway). It fits well in the hand and I love that all the buttons are on the right-side. The S6 has the volume buttons on the left-hand side which was annoying for one-handed use. The placement of the fingerprint reader is amazing I have seen it on the back in other phones but I think Huawei found the sweet-spot for me. It's in the PERFECT place for my long fingers. Otherwise the build-quality is solid it doesn't feel like it would explode on impact if I dropped it. On the other hand the S6 was nasty-feeling without a case with all the glass and was so thin I feared shattering it.Display (4/5):For a mid-range budget phone the display is very attractive. There is some slight saturation on blacks and reds seem to POP with intensity. This is especially noticeable using the camera. However I am fond of black-themed UIs so I have black on black and it actually looks very nice without too much saturation. You're not going to get the intense color-ranges you will with Samsung's AMOLED screen. The Honor 6X is a standard IPS LCD screen coming in at 1080x1920 with a ~403 PPI density. Better than other mid-range devices and you really can't beat that for the price. The screen is crisp and clear if you're comparing it to a high-range phone you're going to be disappointed. However remembering you only paid ~$250 (as of this review) then you'll be pleasantly surprised! I have used the phone in bright light and darkest night with no issues. Screen is amazing for the price but there are better screens on higher-end phones (if you want to pay for them that is).Screen Physical (2/5):I had to say something about the actual GLASS that comes with the device. It comes with a pre-installed screen protector it doesn't look like a factory film it literally looks like a SCREEN PROTECTOR (however it's really not it's just a cheap plastic thing that doesn't like to come off). If you're buying this phone do yourself a favor and GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP. I always protect my devices with either a glass or the ""liquid"" screen protectors (the gel-like kind) and this phone absolutely has to have one. I did a screen stress-test and it received several small scratches just by being in my pocket for a day without a protector something a phone with any kind of tempered glass or gorilla glass would not do. It's not super bad you're not going to encounter any massive scrapes from daily use if you carry it without anything else in your pocket but you WILL get a lot of small annoying scratches. The good news is any glass or gel screen protector will cover those right up!Launcher Emotion UI (3/5):EMUI get's a pretty bad rap but it's honestly not THAT bad. My biggest gripe is the lack of an app drawer it forces everything to the main screen which can get pretty cluttered even if you're using the folders. Alas this is not a heavily weighing factor for me because third-party launchers exist. Other than that it's a fairly standard launcher it's actually very snappy and fast. If you can get over the no app drawer then it shouldn't be an issue at all.Speed/Snappiness/Responsiveness (5/5):The Honor 6X is sporting a Kirin 655 2.1GHz Cortex-A53 (with a Mali-T830MP2 GPU) which is an impressive chip for the price. I did a stress test with YouTube a 3D game Facebook Chrome (with multiple windows) Google Maps and Google Music all in the background of the device at once and saw only a minimal amount of device lag. Albeit in reality I wouldn't have all those things open at once anyway. Standard use sees absolutely no lag and the device is always incredibly responsive. One of the biggest issues I have had with trying out mid-tier budget phones is that after a couple of apps open they DRAGGGGG to almost a halt before closing something. This phone handles it like a bloody champ!External SD Card Slot (5/5):Thought I'd just add this here most expensive phones these days are sorely lacking this and I do love to download everything and anything. Especially since I use my device everyday as a music player so I require a lot of space! You can add a 256 GB SD card for all your HD videos and music on the go!Camera (5/5):This is really where this phone SHINES. All the other mid-tier phones I have tried all have a terribad camera. I mean it's normally VERY bad. If you're in the market for a budget phone and want a nice camera look no further. This camera rivals my Edge S6 (which I have touted as the best camera on any smartphone when it came out). The camera app has a bunch of awesome built-in features and you can tell they spent some time here. The Pro Photo mode really lets you change anything you want to get that AWESOME shot. HDR works as intended. The ""Good Food"" option seems to be some sort of macro setting accentuating the warm tones. The ""Light Painting"" feature is actually really cool it mimics and recreates those cool light-shots you can get from moving cars or spelling stuff out with lights! I had great fun with the ""Slo-Mo"" mode where you can make things slow motion and even edit whatever is slow motion at the end of it. The ""Document Scan"" mode works AMAZINGLY. It will auto-snap and crop any document you're currently trying to take a picture of and then auto-edit it for readability. I used it at work to take a lazy-screencap of a document on my computer monitor and it worked GREAT!The secondary camera is actually very very nice. Coming in at 8MP and an auto-beauty mode for those flawless selfies! It has all the same features as the standard camera so they didn't skimp on all the features just because it's a secondary.I'd also like to add that Huawei integrated a classic Gallery instead of incorporating Photos like almost every other phone has done. I really miss the old-school gallery and I thank Huawei for actually including one instead of me having to pay for a decent one through Google Play.Sound (2/5):The headset speaker is decent you can definitely hear people. They're not particularity crisp or mega-clear. You can certainly hear them just fine the loudness isn't a big issue. The call quality is varying it might be my service who knows. The speaker is sorely lacking it's not loud and at it's max volume it kind of sounds like a muffled room noise. It's not AMAZINGLY bad but if you're an audiophile looking for a decent speaker this is not the budget phone for you (I don't think audiophile and budget should be used in the same sentence). It gets the job done I usually carry headphones or a bluetooth speaker with my anyway so this didn't shy me away from the phone at all so I don't weight very heavily on this part.Ports/Comms (3/5):The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 3/5 is because it lacks 5 GHz Wi-fi. Something that seemingly every other mid-tier phone has incorporated Huawei decided to just not on the Honor 6X. This is a bit annoying to me because I was seriously spoiled on my 5 GHz wi-fi at my house. No NFC so if you're looking to use Android Pay you'll probably have to sync a smartwatch to the phone! Other than that there's v4.1 bluetooth chip with all the trimmings it works flawlessly and amazingly. It doesn't seem to use any power at all!MicroUSB. Really Huawei? C'mon you could of scored a 5/5 with me with USB-C and 5 GHz wi-fi! With almost every other phone moving over now to USB-C (sans Samsung) it would seem natural that Hauwei would do this. They're already using it on all their other flagship phones. I guess it was to save on the price which I can totally get. However I really really love USB-C.Fingerprint Reader (5/5):Thought I'd throw this in here because most fingerprint readers are just awful. Not in terms of functionality but in positioning. The reader on the Honor 6X is AMAZINGLY places for actual use. The S6 Edge has it on the front of the phone which is useless for me because I normally place my phone face-down or it's in my pocket with the screen toward me. The response time on the reader is insane! One micro-second tap and BAM you're in. At first I thought it was fake so I had several buddies try it and NOPE! Wouldn't let them in. Way to put an awesome reader that definitely rivals the high-end phones Huawei!Battery (5/5):Wow my S6 Edge had a terrible battery life if you compare it to the Honor 6X. I use data bluetooth wi-fi and max screen brightness everyday. I'm a Reddit and YouTube lover so I'm constantly on those throughout the day. With all that on using a Reddit app probably ~20 times a day and watching about ~30 minutes of YouTube everyday I still get home after a 12 hour work-day with about 40% battery left. With my S6 I ALWAYS had to plug it in mid-day because it would be at 10% at 3 PM. With the Honor 6X I just plug it in once a night and leave it there. On my days off I don't even have to charge it at night it's normally sitting at about 80% without heavy use. There's also a ""Phone Optimizer"" built in that helps extend battery life. It will even tell you how much battery life it might save if you turn off X feature.Overall (5/5):Despite the small downsides the Honor 6X comes in swinging at a $250 price point. If you're looking for a feature-packed phone that has an awesome camera and amazing battery life LOOK NO FURTHER! I am currently using this device as my main device. I have NEVER used a mid-tier budget phone as a main device but this one really bit me! Great job Huawei the Honor 6X is awesome!",0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MT13NNB,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       A truly outstanding phone  for an amazing price.  February 14  2017By Jackie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After dealing with unreliable phone service providers (I'm looking at you Virgin Mobile and Straight Talk) and glitchy phones (I'm looking at you LG Volt and Volt 2 as well a a Samsung Galaxy phone) that consistently contained way too much bloatware (because of said unreliable phone services) and eventually started to die faster and faster I decided to do a lot of research for a few months before deciding which phone brand and service provider I would switch to.I was initially looking at the Honor 8 but the price was a bit steep for me so I decided to wait. I'm a firm believer in that you don't need to spend $400+ on a good phone and that the best phone service doesn't have to cost you hundreds of dollars a month. After taking a small break from research I came back to Amazon and found this phone last week. The price was nice and while the reviews were mixed I decided to take a plunge and buy this phone after watching a few videos about it and reading articles about it. I also ditched Virgin Mobile in favor of Cricket (which has been amazing so far! I actually get reception at home in the middle of my rural/ghost town).The phone arrived two days after I ordered it and the battery was at 60% battery out of the box giving me the ability to activate it right away and play around with it. A lot of these reviews complain about the operating system skin/EMUI (along with various other things) but honestly it's not all that different to me. Maybe it's because I adapt really quickly to things and have a fast learning curve (and am pretty tech savvy for not knowing all the correct terminology).Before I list positives and negatives let me just say that the most important things to me in a phone are internal storage space processing power and battery life. Oh and of course customization capabilities (like changing font faces) GPS and a nice set of front and back facing cameras. I don't care so much about having to learn or adapt to a new style of system since I enjoy learning about them and getting used to them on my own.POSITIVE POINTS1. Internal Storage: which allowed me to uninstall the useless apps that were pre-installed. The capacity also allowed me install all the apps that I previously had spread out between different devices (because each one had bloatware that couldn't be uninstalled or disabled). It also gave me the ability to add new games/apps that I've been wanting to try. Even after installing all the apps I wanted to as well as migrating data from apps I previously used (including: Discord Kingdom Hearts Unchained X Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag Mystic Messenger Sailor Moon Drops Alphabear. Pokemon GO [which I can actually use AR mode finally] TsumTsum Steven Universe: Soundtrack Attack Tumblr Instagram Snapchat LINE LINE Camera Layout Bitmoji LINE Webtoon Zedge and Huawei Themes) I still have more than half of my internal storage space free.2. Battery Life/Processing Power: if you read through my long list of apps above then you can guess I enjoy a fair amount of mobile gaming and a little bit of social media in my spare time. This phone doesn't slow down and doesn't overheat while I play for hours when I get the chance for it. The battery of course drains but not anywhere near as quickly as my old phones/devices did.  After a full charge I was able to enjoy 8-10+ hours of gaming and switching from app to app without having to worry about recharging. When the phone isn't in use the battery life is even more impressive barely draining from hour to hour. I went from having to charge my previous devices multiple times a day or having them die out on me to only needing to charge once a day usually at night/when I go to bed. I also love not having to deal with crashing apps/glitchy apps.3. Cameras: perhaps because my previous experiences with phone cameras have been full of disappointments I can easily say that the cameras on this phone are 100% fantastic. Even though I don't take a lot of selfies I do take lots of pictures of things aside from myself (like nature food arts/crafts scenery etc.) and the images come out crystal clear and pretty vibrant unless it's in a low-light setting. Of course I rarely would even think of taking a photo in that environment so that doesn't bother me or dull my enthusiasm for this phone. I look forward to being able to play around with my cameras more.4. Fingerprint Scanner: I just think this is a really cool feature now no one but me can unlock my phone which is pretty awesome. I have had no problems with it and setting it up was really simple and quick.5. GPS/Compass: Since playing Pokemon Go this became something of great importance to me. My previous devices were absolutely terrible when it came to playing this game. However this phone has given me the smoothest experience with absolutely no GPS-related problems.6. Graphics: To be concise the graphics/display quality on this phone is easily a 10/10 for me. Youtube videos and all my game/apps look sharp and clear. The colors aren't dull or overly vibrant.NEUTRAL POINTS1. Customization: If you like me enjoy changing fonts then you'll need to install an app like Huawei Themes which provides a nice selection of font faces to use. It's a bit of a shame that there aren't options other than the default font pre-installed but this doesn't bother now that I have an app for that.2. Speaker: I usually use my headphones but on the random occasion that I decide not to I will admit the speakers tend to be on the quieter side until you turn the volume up 70% or more. It's not that big a deal but I thought to just put that out there for honesty's and informing others' sake.3. I am used to having the option to move an app's data from the internal storage to an SDcard. This phone as far as I've explored doesn't provide the option to do so. This doesn't bother me because I have plenty of internal storage for apps and plenty of external storage for everything else so this is just something I thought to note.NEGATIVE POINT1. Not enough case options though this doesn't reflect so much on the phone's manufacturer as it does on those who manufacture phone cases. I just really want to be able to buy a clear plastic case for this phone (for decoden) and character cases (like Rilakkuma  Gudetama or Stitch or just in general cute cases) but I can't because there aren't any. I had to settle for a basic dual layer case (the case provides really nice protection though). Just in case any of you need a case here's the link: Honor 6X Case with Built-in Stand SPARIN Rugged Dual Layer Cases for Huawei Honor 6X 2017 with [360 Degree Ring Stand] [Corner Protection].,0
Unlocked Cell Phones,B01MT13NNB,Huawei Honor 6X Dual Camera Unlocked…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Great budget phone  February 12  2017By Joel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,While not as fast as some more expensive and high end phones it does what all smartphones do goes on the internet access to apps and makes calls. Got this phone as a replacement for my wifes Note 4. I think she likes this phone just a bit more than her Note. It's not packed with all the gimmicky features as the Note or other phones but it does everything else. Not sure on NFC for Android pay since I don't use phone. It's very light almost to the point I thought it was a fake phone. Camera isn't going to win awards but does a decent job. Screen is nice and clear. The biggest and best thing about this phone is the battery life. My wife gets about a day and a half on a full charge. Not bad at all considering she's a power user on the phone or maybe she finally realized she killed her Note by being on it all day even while charging. Either way it has fast charge and expandable memory something else she was looking for. All in all for not having to go to the store to upgrade an increase our bills it's one of the best buys we've done. Just put a glass screen protector on it for her sake. No app drawer easy fix I put nova launcher on there and tweaked it a bit and she loves it. Not bad indeed. Probably will.look another phones for upgrades in the future. OnePlus 3T for me I think.,0

Great battery life that last over a day with heavy usage.  Duo Camera rear and great front camera taking.  The screen resolution are great.  The size of the phone is great. fitted well in hand and comfy.  Very light compared to a smaller previous phone I got.  Super fast at charging too ( if you put it in ultra life mode to charge.  1% -about 2 hours for fully charge).  Phone itself got really great features and customize option that your guys can explore yourself.  Fingerprint scanner unlocked ARE crazy fast- no joke about that in 0.3 sec.  I don't understand why would I ever spend more money on phone when there one like this out there.  You NOT getting anything better anyway.  beside most phone life span 1-3 years.  Even you didn't physically damage it. the manufacturer will make it not lasted out.  New software draining you battery like madness.  incompatibility of apps ect.  that's just how business do thing.  But when you paying for a great phone like Honor 6x for 1/3 of the price.  You can get one every year just to get one lol.,0

It's performance is out standing it's camera is way better then I thought it would be. I tested its camera with an iPhone 7 and it's almost impossible to see any difference in some pictures the 6x is even better. So many of its futures come in handy. I get  one day and a half using it for phone calls all day at work. And tested using it as less as possible and I passed two days with out recharging. It's got an expensive feel to it and at its price you don't care if you take it work beach or even lose it. Great  phone!,0

It is the same size as the iPhone 5/5s and shares the same cases. It has almost identical specs to the iPhone 6s. The main difference between the SE and 6s is that the SE does not have an upgraded front facing camera or the 3D touch capability. The SE has incredible battery life and the 12mp rear camera is a good improvement. Perfect phone for someone who wants to have more speed and performance with a smaller screen.,0

For this shirt choose your normal size (as expected).  I tried to size down and the shirts were too small.  I am 5'9""/160/36 DD and purchased a Medium.  I really needed a Large (the medium was too small in the chest sleeves and stomach.)  The return cost is at buyers' expense so be aware of that when you buy.  Also the ""jade"" color is not as pictured.  In the photograph it looks to be a teal-based green.  The item I received is more kelly-green based.  The quality and cut of the shirts are great and I will be buying the Large size in other colors.  My normal shirt size is a Large.  Hope this review was helpful.**Update.  I received the Large size and they fit great in the shoulders and chest.  The Large is however still pretty snug in the waist/hips.  I have a 30"" waist and 40"" hips and you can see the top of my jeans through the shirt.  If you are pear-shaped or have larger hips I would suggest to size up.",0

To give you a visual my turquoise necklace harmonized with color or this shirt and I have a jade necklace which clashed with it because it looked more green.  Therefore the color is a little more bluish than in the picture on the product page on Amazon which was a nice surprise because I like that color better.  Also I usually wear a Small or X-Small top and ordered the Small which was very roomy.  I am glad I did not size up as some reviews had suggested.  It had no wrinkles after I washed it by hand and drip dried.  Not sure how long the fabric will hold up it is somewhat thin and I would imagine a lighter color in this shirt would be more see through but this one is not.  I like it so much that I plan to order two more colors.,1

For lifting I'm not just sitting in my own sweat it's great. And they come in so many colors I've got four pairs at home and two on the way. I used to be a loyal Under Armour customer but I can get three pairs of these for the same price as one UA pair. It's safe to say I've found my new favorite.I work out 5 times a week I'm 5'6"" tall 130 pounds and the small size fits me pretty well.",1

Maxx and LOVING them I was thrilled to see that they so many styles available on Amazon too (for almost the same price as T.J.Maxx). I went ahead and bought 4 different styles at the same time to compare.-----------------------------------------Here is a list of the 4 styles I purchased:-Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small-Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small-Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S-High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small-----------------------------------------BODY TYPE: I am 5'4 135 pounds very pear shaped.I want my leggings to be multi-functional meaning I want to be able to wear them around the house around town to work out to hike and under my ski clothes.------------------------------------------Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small:These are also great versatile leggings! I would say the waist is mid-rise which is very flattering for me and most women. Length is the same on the high waisted just a small bit of bunching at the bottom for me but I don't mind it at all. Good compression and stay tight all day. Definitely recommend!-----------------------------------------Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small:These are the only pair from the 4 I purchased that I am returning and also the most inexpensive. While the material is very soft and comfortable it is mostly cotton with not nearly enough ""give"" for my taste. They are also EXTREMELY long. If you are very tall and thin go for these. I personally thought they were to snug around my calves and way too long to look normal on me.-----------------------------------------High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small:These are AWESOME! Highly recommend! The length is a tad long but the minor bunching at my ankles doesn't bother me one bit. The high waist is comforting on those days when you want a little extra help keeping everything in. Very comfortable and good compression and stay tight all day. Absolutely buying another pair of these.-----------------------------------------Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S:These are the same ones I bought from T.J. Maxx and they are the perfect capri length for me. I would say the waist is mid-rise too which is very flattering for most women. Have good compression but are still very comfortable! I love these in the summer too since they are capris they look really cute with sandals.",1

I got my first pair of them on a clearance rack 2 years ago at an irregulars-type department store for $9 and I now have 4 pair.Yes I have worn these tights to yoga - but more importantly I've worn them EVERYWHERE. They're a perfect legging fabric - opaque thick but not bulky great quality warm without being too hot AND DID I MENTION OPAQUE?! Curvy ladies I am a 12/14 and I think we have all experienced ""the sheen."" You know - when your leggings are too tight/thin and you get that iridescent look that is your skin showing through? These leggings have none of that. I can comfortably wear shirts that don't TOTALLY cover my hips and butt - like tshirts!! - without any fear of the dreaded see-through butt effect you get from so many other leggings.The tummy control top on these is THE way to go; they shape and fit your curves really well and don't roll down at all!!! I have a legging addiction - over 60 pairs from LuLaRoe to BlackMilk to lululemon to Danskin to you name it - and these are my everyday go to pair. The only issue I have with them - and it is minor - is that sometimes the only ones I can find at the store have a logo on the back calf which everyone thinks is a sticker and tries to remove. However the ones I've ordered from Amazon don't seem to have that issue anyway so problem solved!",0

They do feel a bit tight in the tummy area though. Muffin top is a thing with these leggings. I'm hoping once I wear them out and wash em a bunch they'll lose a bit of resistance there. As for athletic material? Eh. It's not gonna take sweat away in fact these feel warm my legs are a bit hotter than the rest of me at this moment be prepared to sweat but hey that's a good thing!I've included some pictures for reference I'm 5'0"" and 190lbs.

I'm 5'2"" and at the longest the band goes right under my butt. I usually wear an XL shirt or 14/16 because of my bust size (34FF) and I bought the XXXL. I could go down a size but it's nice and flowy and I like how it doesn't cling.The best part is the armholes are nice and high. Usually shirts that are big enough around my bust have huge armholes but this shirt doesn't. It keeps it from looking sloppy even though it's nice and roomy.It comes in a bunch of colors so I'm definitely buying more.",0

It drooped at the neck area just right as it showed just enough cleavage without having to be adjusted when bending over.  If I wanted a tighter fit I could probably order a size smaller.  I've worn this at my job with casual trousers with my jeans.  and with a casual long skirt.  It worked for all looks.  The color is nice as well.  It's an all around great top.,0

August 8  2016By Kristin B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"We recently had family pictures and I wanted to find a blue shirt for myself that I would wear afterwards. I came across this top and had never ordered anything by Lock and Love before but I really liked the look of the shirt. It is just the color I wanted so I ordered the Royal Brite color.When it arrived I tried it on right away to make sure it would fit so I could exchange it if necessary and it fits perfectly! I am 5'6"" 155 pounds with a 36D chest and I ordered a large. I typically wear a medium or a large depending on the brand and style and opted for the large. I found the size chart under the images section to be misleading and confusing so I ended up using the one listed under the product description which I feel is more accurate. This shirt fits great. As other reviewers have stated it is slightly boxy but you can use that to your advantage if you want a shirt that hides your belly. I'm still carrying some extra post-baby weight and love this shirt because it makes me feel less self-conscious about my tummy.This shirt has cap sleeves and is pleated on both the front and back neckline which adds a bit more of a design. There is a defined waistband on the shirt so you can adjust it to fit however you'd like on your waist. This shirt is also VERY soft. That's the first thing I noticed about it when I took it out of the bag. It is made of 95% rayon and 5% spandex and feels very cool and comfortable during the hot summer months. It feels like a good quality shirt and is made in the USA. The washing instructions say to hand wash or machine wash it in cold water and then lay flat to dry. I didn't want to take the chance that I'd ruin it so I put it in a lingerie bag and put it in with my dark laundry and that seems to work well. Then I lay it on our drying rack. It seems to wrinkle while drying but once I put it on and wear it for a bit my body heat helps to iron out some of those wrinkles. This shirt is lightweight and you'll want to wear a nude or plain-color bra with it. I wore a black bra with the Royal Brite shirt and it didn't show through at all but a bra with patterns on it will show through at least a little bit.I am very pleased with my purchase of this shirt and I have ordered other colors as well. I initially purchased Royal Brite which is a bright royal blue and loved it so much that I also ordered Red and Dark Purple which are all shown in the pictures I've included. I've got Black and Coral on order as well. Because of my fair skin and blonde hair I prefer to wear darker colors and I love the selection of colors for this shirt. I showed my mom this shirt and she liked it so much that she ordered one as well. At first I thought the price of this shirt was slightly expensive but considering how soft and flattering it is I feel it's worth the price. If you are considering ordering this shirt make sure you use the size chart under the product description instead of the images. I love this shirt already and will order more colors in the future when I need to add some to my wardrobe!",1

It is a toss-up between this and the cap sleeve hip length Bepei top. This top is a lighter-weight fabric & sleeveless which is great for our summers with temps up to 45°C or for layering with a light cardigan in springtime but it hits just below the waist so it doesn't give me the long lean profile I'm after. I have a short torso & where this top hits on me it makes me look thick in the waistline. It's definitely comfortable and looks better with a skirt than it does with capris or jeans. I also bought a Bepei top in the same style which I like better. It's a thicker fabric and has cap sleeves. Not as cool for summer but it hits a couple of inches lower and gives me a slimmer profile. This is a great top for hanging around the house but won't be worn as much as the Bepei top. I personally find this brand to run a little large & the tops are a loose flowy style. I'm 5' 7"" size 10 32G chest and while I normally wear a medium in tops I ordered a small and it fits nicely. A medium would be too loose on me. All my other tops in this brand hit lower like the Bepei top so this is the only one in this brand I found that hits me at a less flattering point.",0

Kalis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love it! I've been looking for new shirts to replace some old ones. These are exactly what I wanted.  Very flattering tighter around the arms loose around the middle.  I've bought about 20 of them and plan to wear them every day.  They've replaced half of my wardrobe.  The material is excellent.  It's super soft and I found the mint light grey purple ombre and  lavender to not be see through at all. The light pink was see through so I sent it back.  I washed one in the washer on cold and then dried it.  It came out okay but with a little pilling. I also washed an identical one on cold and then hung to dry. It dried very soft without the pilling. So I plan to hang to dry to keep them looking as nice as possible so I can wear them for the next 10 years but if I dry them it won't be a big deal. They look extra great paired with the Trendy United long skirts.  They are true to size so I bought half large and half XL. If you go up to the larger size it will be less tight and more blousy but both sizes fit me.,0

These are the exact same if not better! Super soft and seem a lot better quality!  It does say hand wash and hang dry. However I washed and ddried them in the washer and dryer to do a deep clean before wear and they came out perfect. Can't beat the price and quality,0

The price and texture of the fabric are great and the variety of different prints are a lot of fun but the fabric is far too thin - they are more like tights instead of leggings and they provide no support. Leggings should feel tight and substantial - these feel flimsy and will probably rip the moment you sit down. As for sizing: I am 5'6"" 125 lbs 28"" waist and 38"" hips. I have very slender but long legs and most skinny jeans are loose around my ankles. I did not have a problem with length but these leggings were far too big in the ankles and knees for me (1 - 2"" extra fabric in these areas). If you are looking for a cheap pair of leggings to wear once or twice got for it; but if you are looking for a wardrobe staple keep looking.",0

August 19  2016By Rue23,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this petticoat to go with ""Pistachio Women's Sun Flower Flowing Knee Length Summer Dress"" which I had bought on Amazon as well as other 50s style dresses that I want to buy. I will admit I love the 50s style of big poofy dresses so I had some trouble deciding which petticoat to buy. I really wasn't sure if this one would add enough volume for my taste but it seemed to be well liked so I decided to try it. I have to admit it took a little adjusting too but I think this petticoat is just poofy enough to wear with a dress without making it look like a costume (although you could definitely wear it with a costume I plan to use it for special occasion/church dresses).I did order the large of this petticoat and I am 5'7"" and weigh around 210lbs. I had debated which size to choose as I have been losing weight and wanted to get a size that I could continue wearing as I do so. I probably should have bought the XL as this was a bit snug on me but the waist is stretchy so I can still wear it. If I did need to order another one then I would definitely go up a size. Also I noticed that most people said this is not itchy which was really surprising considering that most petticoats tend to be itchy because of the fabric used. However the lining on this one is really good at protecting your skin from the itchy outer skirt. I did notice that when sitting the lining can slip up enough to make the stiffer fabric brush your legs but more than likely it would stay put better if I had purchased the correct size.I attached several pictures to give you an idea for how well the skirt actually works. The first is a picture of my dress without a petticoat the second is the dress once I added the petticoat. Hope that is a helpful reference point!Summary: I think this was an excellent price for a lovely product! Now I can buy all the cute 50s dresses that I love so much but that only look right with a good petticoat. Well worth the money.",1

Gentle wash  air dry only !  April 16  2015By Amazon michigan Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Soft  comfortable and well-designed I want more! As for the fit I think many of the other reviewers who purchased larges and  Xl  might have liked the fit in a smaller size. They complain of a loose wide neckline and big bat wing sleeves but those are not issues if the top is sized correctly. This top is super stretchy and with the ruching there are infinite adjustments in the mid section to fit over a multitude of body types. I am 5'3"" and weigh 150lbs. A large or extra large would be baggy and sloppy on me. The fabric is thin without being sheer. Note: after wearing it twice in two weeks and  washing on gentle (lay flat to air dry) I am noticing the material is starting to pill/show wear (blue top)  . It's looking like a comfy pajama top now. I can only imagine how it would look if I had tried to tumble dry in the dryer. That did not stop me from purchasing more... just please know the shirt may not last long if washed and dried in a washing machine.Lesson learned read and follow the label directions. Update: The pink and grey tops in photos  have been machine washed on hand wash/gentle cycle and layed flat to dry  they are holding shape and are not pilling  like the light blue shirt.",0

I bought the pink v-neck in a small and the heathered grey regular neck in a small as well.They are both very light material so the pink is see-through. You can see my black leggings under it and the bumps in my bra too. I love the 3/4 length sleeves and the dolman style but personally I don't love the v-neck on this one as much. The top is tighter in my belly than I thought it would be. I chose the Dolman style because they're usually loose in the tummy but fitted at the hips. This top isn't as loose as I would've liked and I had to really suck the gut in for a decent photo. (I've had two kids so that pooch is harder to hide!)The grey one also has a ""J"" logo on the bottom left of the shirt on the hip but the pink one doesn't have that. It's kind of annoying and makes the shirt look cheap but you can fold it under to hide it as I did in my picture.I bought another top at the same time from Lock & Love in a small and I was surprised to see that that is the same company as Made by Johnny. That small fit me perfectly though so I think the small in this is right for me I just have more gut than I should and I was sucking it in for the photo! For anyone else around my size I'd recommend ordering a small and a medium to try them both on for size. I'll definitely return the pink one of these because it isn't flattering in this size/color combo on me at all. But if you have a flat stomach than this size is for you! ;)",1

The olive color is a little darker than what you would think of when people say olive but I think it's still a very nice color. As you can see from the picture the red tends to lean on the orange side (it's a little more red in person but the lighting was weird for those pictures) but it's a great bright color! The fabric is light and flowy exactly as I expected. Great for summer!  They fit very well and I love the way they look! The neckline is a little wide for me but if you plan on wearing it off the shoulder go for it! I probably could've gotten away with a small in this and still look just as good.

I think it's good for warm weather. The rouching on the sides is also nice. I do think you need to wear a camisole or something else underneath since the material is not that forgiving.

Your flexibility is not restricted in any way and are very very comfortable.Design - let's face it fashion is just as important as function and hey if you look good you feel good and if you feel good your workouts are more efficient; therefore; looking good = better workouts!! Hahaha in all seriousness these are pretty cute.Cons:High Intensity - do NOT wear these to a high energy boot camp or to kickboxing. You will spend the entire time hiking them up in the rear. They are not meant to be super tight and hold up with Jumping Jacks or Burpees. Yoga yes. Jump squats no.See-through ""ISH"" - when I bend waaaayyy over for a downdog in yoga the pants may be almost kinda  sorta do I really see anything?  now I am staring at my own butt a little too long... Not really see but maybe shiny. And no one is going to stare that long at anyone's pants in a dim lit yoga studio or really care that much to look in the first  place to make it a big deal.Final thoughts:Comfortable and cute durable holds up after heavy wear and many washes. Design is high quality. These are just not designed for high intensity activities so don't expect a high performance athletic pant for running etc. but are perfect for everything else. Pilates yoga running around I even sometimes wear these under my snowpants while downhill skiing. For the price point you really can't go wrong! Will be buying another color soon for my Core & More class! :-)Cheers!",0

Great value  April 18  2016By M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I ordered a medium and was nervous about how these were going to fit. Couldn't be happier! I'm 5""9' with a 35"" inseam 150lbs and typically wear medium in yoga and running pants. The pants are very fitted which I was planning on. Running pants are usually short on me. These are perfectly at my ankles maybe 1/2"" or less above low profile running shoes. They stay in place during workouts. I've worn them several times before writing this review just to make sure I'm happy with them. So they've endured running  yoga and weight lifting. Several runs through the washing machine and still holding their shape with no issues in the seams. They are the black and grey plaid--the fabric is thicker than I was expecting  and I'm thrilled. No see through issues and they don't creep up (doesn't look like my body is trying to eat them--you know what I'm saying). I will say that I'm not tight and fit (still toning and working off some baby weight). I have a little ""muffin top"" in these nothing a top can't conceal and not detectable when I'm in a zip up jacket and honestly I have yoga pants that are less flattering than these. They're going to look even more amazing after I finish toning. I'm ordering more in different patterns hopefully I'll have the same success with those. Well worth ordering! I'm beyond happy with the price. These are my favorite workout pants right now. They're more durable and look better than some of my $90+ pants.",0

March 25  2016By Janessa Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I normally wear a medium in 90 degrees by reflex. I purchased the navy with polka dots and leopard. Here are the fits as follows for reference.Navy polka dots- have more of a yoga feel. They are not super high waisted and fit well. I am 5'2"" 140# (bigger thighs). I was worried about them being super see through or white. They are a little when squaring down but nothing crazy like someone else mentioned with the black and white polka dot pantsLeopard- these feel more like thick leggings. However still great quality. They do not slip and hold to my body better than the navy polka dots. I ordered these in a medium as well. These could be dressed up or down. One thing I like is there is a thick waist band with their brand of leggings. These do not show any ""white"" under the fabric and are not see through. I really like how soft they are.The material of both are quality and polyester and spandex (just different % of blends). I will be ordering more. I usually wear a variety of brands when it comes to leggings and yoga pants. These could be described as a step down from lululemon but nicer than old navy.

I ordered an XL in 3 pairs bought the black polka dot the croquis black and white and the printed feather. I'm 5'5 and wear a size 14 (12 if I'm having a good day and depending on the brand). I bought these because the reviews seemed to favor on the positive side compared to other brands I was investigating. I started doing a boot camp and so I wanted to get some fun workout pants. Well kind of disappointed. The feather print fit more snug than the other 2 but made the booty look good. The other 2...I could see my bright green panties through them without even doing anything but standing. So that's a no go. Even when I just put my hands through the material before putting them on I could see through them. Also they feel like just cotton leggings. I was expecting more of a workout material feel. These are basically leggings with a thick waist band. So if you're expecting a higher quality material for working out be warned. They are really cute but I don't need to worry about my goodies showing when I'm just standing around. I didn't see my underwear with the feather print and I did a few squats in front of the mirror to double check. They are also on the longer side-i had them pulled up all the way and there was material bunching at the bottom so this should be a plus for taller women.

I have some higher end leggings that I paid a lot of money for that don't do this I was hoping because of the good reviews I may have found a good pair for cheap.  I wear a size 14 in jeans and the XL was a little tighter than most other XL leggings that I purchase.  I'm sure these are fine for people with thinner legs than me I just don't like the stretched out look. The other thing that turned me off was the polka dots themselves they varied in size shape and color.  It almost looks as though they are painted on.,0

I received this product a little over a week ago and I am very satisfied with it. As far as waist trainers go it is very comfortable and I can breath in it without discomfort. I wear it several hours a day and when I work out and I am already seeing results. I ordered it based off of my waist measurements and it is very true to size. I recommend this product to anyone who is trying to flatten their stomach.,0

February 13  2017By Mandy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Typically I prefer to wear KJC Faja waist trainers (absolutely amazing results but a much more intense product) but I was looking for an everyday waist trainer that I can wear at work. My work is highly active where I am typically on my feet almost the entire day bending squatting as well as carrying pushing and manuevering upwards of 80 pounds of equipment regularly.  With this activity in mind I sought this product out as a solution to a light waist support product while at work especially at a $10 price. As a waist trainer it is okay it provides light support and allows all day activity. It is also breathable which is a giant bonus in my book! It does have some cons; the boning that helps the product retain its shape is very flexible and at times will poke uncomfortably I also think it will not remain intact with regular use and may begin to stick out or otherwise lose its shape and purpose; the material although breathable may lose its shape as it is very stretchy. Overall if you are looking for a cheap and light support waist trainer this is it and if you are new to waist training this is a good starter product....but if you are looking for a more supportive figure shaping product that will last I suggest looking into other options such as KJC shape-wear.,0

It slims my stomach a bit but I notice the biggest difference in my sides. They look smaller and smoother. It's not magical so it doesn't give me the perfect body but it makes me feel more comfortable wearing tighter clothes.It's easy to put on and VERY breathable. Which means I don't get all gross and sweaty when I have it on for hours at a time.It's kind of a pain if I'm sitting for long periods of time because the hard plastic digs into my hips but besides that I love it. I've already recommended it to many friends.,0

It definitely helped me be aware of my posture and it was comfortable to wear. I've been wearing it a little more than a week and today I noticed it didn't feel as tight. Well it's not because it's already working. Upon inspection I noticed that one side looks like it's starting to come apart. I mean I know it's stretched that's what they are supposed to do but I was hoping it would be a little bit more durable.This is my first time using a waist trainer so I picked this one for the price just to see how I felt about the whole concept of waist training. I liked it so much that I ordered this same waist trainer in black (the first one is an off white color). I wanted one for lighter colored clothes but I also have some darker clothing that is sheer so the light colored waist trainer would be very obvious. And I also figured I could alternate them so they wouldn't get too stretched out too quickly.Well a little more than a week and the first one is clearly not going to last. It isn't too small I made sure I was realistic about what size to order. I got an XL and it fit very comfortably. They longest I wore it for in one day was 8 hours.so for starting out $10 isn't a huge investment and I'm glad I tried it out. But this particular waist trainer won't hold up for long. Knowing that I will go for a better quality product.,0

I have always believed that if you don't look like that with your clothes off then why bother? I purchased this hoping that it may actually train my waist on top of making healthier choices of course.  But with a shape like mine I was pretty certain it would not fit.  What I mean by that is that I am extremely hippy and my lower stomach is pudgy.  Let me just say: I WAS SO WRONG!!! This fit and snatched ALL of my mid section up like magic.  I know some complain about the length...I am 5'3 and it PERFECTLY fits from beneath my boobs to right above my kit kat!  I broke a sweat putting it on the first time but it is super comfortable once you get it on.  I would recommend ordering a size larger if u can for that perfect fit.  I am able to sit and bend in it relatively easy!  It does not roll down or cut into my skin either.  I saw very few reviews representing the larger women so I knew I needed to post this.  The pics are all with the waist trainer on btw!  I wear a 22/24 in jeans and I got the 6x.  Idk if I'll wanna wear this all day but I will definitely sleep in it.  I hope I can see some results with this...so far so good though! Ladies please give this a try!!!,1

I've been wearing it for 5 weeks and I have seen a difference. I do exercise but I don't diet so my results are not dramatic. However I have noticed that it helps me eat less.. Only issue I have is that it can be uncomfortable to workout in or sit it. The picture is my progress for 4 weeks.,1

It arrived lightening fast. I began wearing a 3XXL in Febuary 2016. Along with consistent exercise colon cleansing and portion control I lost 35 pounds and 4 inches off my waist. I am now wearing a 2XXL and should be on the third row within three to six weeks. In another two months I will order a 1XXL and continue the same process. This waist trainer does help me in losing waist inches and weight along with the correct protocol that works for me. I have the latex one for the gym and the satin one for wear outside of the gym. I highly recommend these for training the waist and for weight loss. The down side is that I have an excess lower tummy pooch from the weight loss and tummy squeeze.,0

Women,B016OM9JU4,YIANNA Women's Latex Sport Girdle Waist…,        18 of 19 people found the following review helpful       Great Product!  January 18  2017By lmw43,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was surprised at how well made the black 25 steel boned latex version was that I purchased from YIANNA. I'm 5'8 and 190 lbs--about 25 lbs heavier than my typical weight--so I ordered a XXL. I can latch the eye hooks to the last row but it is more comfortable when I move around and am at work all day to use the second row.It smooths out my back and stomach pooch and doesn't show through my cotton winter dresses SO MUCH BETTER than most of the spandex-y shapewear I have worn. The first time getting into it is tricky but after that it is easy and so much easier than pulling on Spanx. I agree with other users that you will find yourself needing to order a size smaller pretty quickly if you are combining wearing it with diet and exercise. The benefit of buying a real steel/whale boned waist training corset is you can tighten it with laces and it will last for pretty much ever...but it will cost several hundred up front and you definitely can't work out in it. While I don't work out in YIANNA's 25 steel boned corset which appears to have spiral steel boning I would try working out in the fabric-only version. Great purchase legit seller awesome price.,0

Nicole,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm in LOVE!I wear a size 6 in jeans but my waist measured out to a size medium so I went with it. I've already got some curves to me and I have a relatively small frame. I have an hour glass figure for sure but I wanted to accentuate that and get permanent results. ""Weight loss wraps"" have never worked for me and seem like a total scam and even though I do exercise that doesn't give my figure a more pronounced curve.I gave four stars because I really wish I had gone with a small. First time putting it on I could get it to the second latch and I realized after taking photos for the review that I can get it to the third latch as well.It is definitely not the companies fault it was user error. I really wish they would make their sizing chart more accurately since I measured to be a medium and I should be in a small.I am going use this one on the second latch for a bit even though I can get to the third then move to the third latch for maybe a few weeks. I intend to order a small once I've worn this one for a while and notice a significant permanent change.It has an amazing structure to it and it keeps my posture nice and straight but it's still comfortable to wear. It's made of very soft fabric and it does have a tiny bit of stretch to it but it doesn't get stretched out if that makes sense (which is awesome if you order a size too small or are a heavier person; this will stretch to fit your body if you go a bit too small).It's also easily hidden under clothes. In two photos I'm wearing a loose top and in one a crop top. You cannot see it at all under the loose top. I was wearing a tight black tank top when I first tried this on and it STILL wasn't too noticeable! Win!I'll be wearing this every day to work for sure (a full 8 hours a day if I can handle it) and I don't think anyone will know except for me!This is by far THE BEST waist trainer I've ever bought. Very well made the boning is awesome and even though you obviously can feel that you're wearing it it doesn't make you feel like you're gasping for air like some trainers do. I was skeptical because most trainers give me anxiety because it's difficult to breathe but this one is just perfect.I would DEFINITELY recommend this. Just make sure you're getting the right size. If you fit between say a small and a medium like I was go for the small. :)",1
Women,B016OM9JU4,YIANNA Women's Latex Sport Girdle Waist…,        31 of 34 people found the following review helpful       and I thought this one would be great for work/gym since it's a little more discreet  September 11  2016By Sarah,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,**photo on left is Yianna corset photo on right is an $75 lace up (Orchard) corset**I've been waist training with steel bones lace up corsets and I thought this one would be great for work/gym since it's a little more discreet. I ordered the black corset with the Yianna tags.SIZING:  I am 5'9 165lbs with a 33 inch waist. So according to the chart I should have ordered a 2XL but since I want this thing to be squeezing the life out of me at all times I ordered a Large. I got it on to the last row of hooks but this thing is LONG even for someone as tall as me. It's totally doable but someone shorter may find it digging into their breasts lucky for me I have very little.MATERIAL: very impressed for that price. Inside is very soft outside feels like neoprene. I like the spacing on the hooks they're pretty spread out so you get more bang for your buck as you size down. I'm noticing minimal wrinkling which is wonderful.SLIMMING EFFECT: if you're looking for a slim mid section than I would say it's 100% effective. Wearing a dark color shirt it's undetectable light colored shirts show a long line down your center where the clasps are. Lucky mine was a little loose where it hits my upper back so there was no roll of fat sitting on top of it.WAIST TRAINING: I was hoping for more of a waist training effect. I feel the most pressure along the lower abdomen and on the hips which are fixed points and you cannot move those in. My lace up corset gives me a squeeze from the mid abdomen up to my rib cage areas that can be shaped. Maybe It could work a little over a long period of time but at least your posture will improve.,1

December 16  2016By Sonya McCoy-Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great waist trainer! (especially for the price).  Not that I have tried any other waist trainer before but based on the fitness gurus online this waist trainer meets all the requirements for top quality (multiple boning that is flexible yet durable breathable yet firm fabric strong hooks that are spaced  an inch apart and the correct vertical length).  I measured a 32"" waist when I first purchased mine and I bought a size Large.  I started in the first row of hooks.  Don't get discouraged when you first try to put it on.  I had to lie on the floor on my back and my husband had to hook the hooks. I almost decided to give up.  I hung in there though.  After the first day I could stand and hook the hooks myself. Your waist starts to conform after 24-48 hours. Now only 2 1/2 weeks in I'm down to the last row of hooks.  Although I have not re-measured my waist I plan to order the medium in a week or so.I decided to start waist training because I could not get my ""diastasis recti"" closed and back in place after child #4.  Diastasis recti is the separating of the lower abdominal muscles that happens during pregnancy to accommodate the growing uterus. Because I always carried children low in my abdomen my diastasis recti grew worse with each pregnancy.  As a result I had a huge ""pooch"" and some pretty severe back pain.  Only 2 1/2 weeks into waist training and my pooch and back pain is severely decreased (without the waist trainer on).  I started doing planks and other ab exercises during week two.  The combination of the waist training and exercises is going to save my waistline.  So glad I did a little research and discovered the healthful benefits of waist training.***Note*** I do wear my waist trainer daily for 8-12 hours while at work and whatever else I'm doing.  Now that it's fall/winter I can conceal it pretty easily under clothing (I bought the black waist trainer).***Another thing*** Wear a thin camisole or undershirt underneath your waist trainer so that the boning does not injure you.",0

November 28  2016By Sj773,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"In the past 3 years I have bought 4 styles of Asics running shoes and these are my favorite!My sell points for determining that these are ""good"" sneakers:1.) Toe Space - I have problems with my toes going numb if I don't have adequate room in the toe box. To accommodate I usually order a size 10 and lace up tightly (when I wear a 9 or 9.5) in regular shoes. This causes my shoes to typically wear faster in the heels because they side around a little but my toes don't go numb after my daily 4 mile trail hike.2.) Comfort - This includes arch support and overall cushioning. I have bad knees so I can tell when the cushioning starts to go in sneakers. Mine last almost 3 months exactly when worn for 4 miles daily.3.) Cuteness - Sorry to be vain but I want sneakers to be cute and have pink on them. These are the only kind I buy. Judge me if you must ;)4.) Easy to put on / take off - I hate untying my shoes so I love that these have a loop in the back so I can slip them on with minimal unlacing (lazy).5.) Doesn't cake-in dirt/mud - When on loose dirt trails I often encounter dirt & mud that gets caked into my soles so I favor the Asics styles over say K-Swiss because the soles don't have a lot of ""hiding places"" for mud to get packed into.I compared:ASICS Women's Gel-Venture 5 - My all time favorite for toe space as well as cushion and arch support and wears well.ASICS Women's Gel-contend 3 - Wider in the arch area but narrow in the toes and heels.ASICS Women's Gel-scram 2 - Great toe space but not much arch support to speak of (super-cute though!)ASICS Women's Gel Frequency 2 - Actually a walking shoe and built much less ""tough"" and more lightweight but has a flimsy feel to it and comes up short against the back of the heel so it fit kinda weird.When I say these shoes ""wear well"" I mean that they don't look like they are falling apart even after much use/wear. The only indicators of wear that they show are some wear on the inside of the heels but probably only because I wear a half size too big on purpose and also some fraying where the inner fabric (pink) meets the lace holes. (See pics)Overall I love these shoes the best of all I've tried in Asics as well as Adidas Saucony Vibram and K-Swiss and won't be straying from the Gel-Venture 5 shoes again. I love them and don't think it gets any better than this :)",1

My last pair (and pairs before that) were a size 8 so that's what I ordered this time despite seeing some other reviews saying to go up a half or full size. I'm unsure as to whether these shoes do run small or if I'm just used to my older pair (that are fairly old) that might possibly be stretched out a bit. But either way the pair I received were a tad bit small but not unbearable. If I ordered this same pair again I would probably try an 8.5.Also wanted to say that I liked the colors in person better than on the website (wanted the blue pair but they were sold out so I got the gray/purple).,1

The reviews were spectacular the brand is well known and the price is reasonable. The definitely hit all the criteria on paper however in practicality for running they are a flop.A true running shoe should not be able to bend in half athe the arch as these do. There should be more support in the middle with more flexibility at the toe. The ""arch support"" that they offer over corrected my natural tread patterns causing shin splints and quarter sized blisters near my cuboid (the outside of my arch). Despite trying multiple pairs of athletic socks (pumas feetures and injinji) the friction continued because the truth of the matter is that these are not true running shoes.Unfortunately I passed the point of return so all I can do now is give my honest opinion on these shoes. I suggest for true runners to buy either brooks or a pair of Asics that is actually designed for running not casual wear as this particular style is designed for. Please don't be swindled by the reviews a true running store would not sell these to a runner. In fact they wouldn't even offer them in stores. Go to a local foot locker Dicks Sporting Goods or any local shoe store that caters specifically to runners and have them measure your foot (typically a running shoe is half to one full size larger than a casual shoe) track your tread pattern and allow you to try on different pairs that are better suited for your feet. I know the convenience of online shopping is attractive to consumers but there are some things that should be done in person.  Buying a pair of running shoes is one of them.",1

Instead there is no gel anything about these. The insole is extremely thin with no support or spring back. I could not wear them until I purchased a different GEL insole. The tread is so hard that it grips on smooth concrete floors causing me to stumble/trip if I stop too suddenly at work. The only positive thing I can say about these is that the ankle area has extra padding and that is at least comfy. Will not purchase ASICS ever again.",0
Women,B00ID0S99I,"90 Degree By Reflex 22"" Yoga Capris - Yoga…",        148 of 157 people found the following review helpful       Decent capris that wash well and hold up nicely; but some downsides - unusually long  pills pretty quickly  May 25  2015By PuppyLove,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I buy tons and tons of capris (Florida - enough said :) and have tried everything from $100 designer brands to $10 Walmart ones. Sometimes I prefer simple light ""around the house"" ones and other times I prefer nicer ""hope the top and accessories are nice enough to make them an actual outfit acceptable to go out to dinner in"" ones. So I'm pretty well versed in the land of capris. Here are my thoughts: (BTW I am 5'2 and around a size 8/curvy. It drives me NUTS when people review clothing and say it was too big/small/short/long etc when they don't give their stats because how is that helpful in any way if you don't know a thing about them :) Moving on:FEEL AND LOOK: They feel nice - better than most active wear brands or Target ish ones. They are thicker than most but not the heaviest I have seen. For cold climates this would actually be IDEAL - however in Florida not so much all the time (though still totally ok for some weather here.) They are made nicely no hanging threads or wrong stitching or anything - maybe not the best construction I have seen but not bad by any means. It's a texture that will attract dust/pet hair/lint and all of that which is pretty common for anything that isn't a shiny finish or material that has that slick feel to it. Very opaque due to thickness so you will NOT have a problem with these being see through or stretching too thin in some places.FIT: I got a large. For me these were too long and not as snug as I would like - I am 5'2 so that kind of adds to this problem :) but about 90% of capris I've had were shorter than these. At 22'' these really are like very short leggings almost - most capris are 16'-18'. ' Normally those lengths work great for me (I like them a little longer but these are literally the longest capris ever :) These have a LOT of bunch for me and I do have to sometimes pull them up to fit snug around my mid calf. Definitely annoying though if I pull them up over my calf a bit more they sometimes stay for a while. I would say for anyone over 5'5 they would be a great length anyone under would probably feel they are too long (unless you really like long capris or have a much fuller figure which would make them slightly shorter) The problem is (for me at least) once they droop past the larger part of your calf they are not snug anymore which is the WEIRDEST LOOK EVER. Because of this they are more around the house for me but if I was tall enough to avoid it I'd probably wear them out more.HOW THEY HOLD UP: They have been washed in cold water with natural color safe bleach and wool dryer balls (no sheets.) The color has stayed well over 2 months washed once a week. The stitching is still tight no strings or holes or anything. The one bad point - PILING - mainly in the crotch area (if you are teeny tiny and don't have any friction this probably won't be bad or happen at all but most women even on the thin side have some - fuller figures will definitely have this.) I realize this will happen with most leggings/capris over time just as a normal result of friction but these did happen after only 3 or 4 washes and not too heavy use when they were on. I have actually had cheaper Target type ones that were used a lot more than this and at the same age piling was about 50% less.  Other than that I feel they wash and wear nicely and shouldn't fall apart prematurely with normal use and good care.PRICE: At around $19 this is a fair price. They are on the higher side of the lower end products definitely not the same level as a $50-$60 pair as they advertise but much better than most $10 cheapo pairs a la Walmart.OVERALL: For colder climates this is a great thickness and for women over 5'5 this would be a great length. If you are that person - these would be a 4 and possibly a 5 depending on your preferences/needs etc. So this could be a great pair or a so so pair (as it was for me thus the 3 rating which would probably be 3.5 if that existed :) However they are cozy nice around the house and won't fall apart in a month like some others so I still do use them.Hope this review helped! Feel free to post any questions and I will try to answer as best as I can!UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS:Color has stayed well true black still which is good.Fit is still mostly the same has only stretched out a slight bit which is goodPilling is terrible at any point where your legs meetLint/pet hair sticks to these 3 seconds after coming out of the dryer - it's like a lint brush  - ughI''m still using these as around the house/walk the dog capris since they never make it more than 3 seconds w/o lint and the fit on me is still a bit weird at the cuffs + length.IMO if you are very tall/very thin and have no pets and an immaculate house they would work best :)",0

Maxx and LOVING them I was thrilled to see that they so many styles available on Amazon too (for almost the same price as T.J.Maxx). I went ahead and bought 4 different styles at the same time to compare.-----------------------------------------Here is a list of the 4 styles I purchased:-Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small-Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small-Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S-High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small-----------------------------------------BODY TYPE: I am 5'4 135 pounds very pear shaped.I want my leggings to be multi-functional meaning I want to be able to wear them around the house around town to work out to hike and under my ski clothes.-----------------------------------------Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S:These are the same ones I bought from T.J. Maxx and they are the perfect capri length for me. I would say the waist is mid-rise too which is very flattering for most women. Have good compression but are still very comfortable! I love these in the summer too since they are capris they look really cute with sandals.-----------------------------------------Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small:These are the only pair from the 4 I purchased that I am returning and also the most inexpensive. While the material is very soft and comfortable it is mostly cotton with not nearly enough ""give"" for my taste. They are also EXTREMELY long. If you are very tall and thin go for these. I personally thought they were to snug around my calves and way too long to look normal on me.-----------------------------------------High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small:These are AWESOME! Highly recommend! The length is a tad long but the minor bunching at my ankles doesn't bother me one bit. The high waist is comforting on those days when you want a little extra help keeping everything in. Very comfortable and good compression and stay tight all day. Absolutely buying another pair of these.------------------------------------------Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small:These are also great versatile leggings! I would say the waist is mid-rise which is very flattering for me and most women.Length is the same on the high waisted just a small bit of bunching at the bottom for me but I don't mind it at all. Good compression and stay tight all day. Definitely recommend!",1

In the attached photo of the three folded capris from right to left the colors are Navy Blue SD Blue Grey SD and Black.Pros- NOT see through if you order the correct size. If these are see-through on you you're either seeing the white liners underneath some styles or need to size up- Cut fits bigger booties and hips- hooray!- You can do all the yoga poses your heart desires in these and not have to worry about these leggings riding down in the back- Patterns are even more vibrant and beautiful in person- Flexible fabric that allows for a wide range of movement- Fabric doesn't get that heavy or soggy feel when you sweat during intense exercise or hot yoga- With the exception of the solid black fabric these fabrics do not show pet hair.Cons- Some patterns have white lining inside which makes the fabric look a little cheap when stretched.

The length is nice it's below the calf which I like and about 4 inches above my ankle.  There is a fingers width space between the leg opening and my skin but I don't mind that loose look and beside I can hike it up higher if I want it to be snug.My complaint is because I'm very particular and will examine every stitching and line this capris is slightly a lighter color than the one I have and they're supposedly both lightning blue.  Another thing is the stitching looks a little cheaper (see picture the one in the back is from Marshalls and the one in the front I ordered from here).  The stitching is off a little and there's a ""hump"" in the waist band that probably wouldn't bother other people but it bothers me.  It's not bad enough for me to return and not worth the hassle to return so I will be keeping the pants.",1

The pants I received were KNOCK OFFS SHIPPED FROM CHINA! (See pictures attached). They came in random Korean packaging the maroon leggins were bright red and they had ""medium"" labels but were clearly XS-XXS. I turned the back inside out to show that they don't have the ""90 Degree by Reflex"" logo screen printed on it as well. FAKE FAKE FAKE. I'm so disappointed I've never had a problem ordering from them until now. 90 Degree by Reflex refused to acknowledge their responsibility so I had to settle this dispute with Amazon. Disappointed in their customer service.I've tried so many brands of athletic pants from Ross all the way to Nike and these have definitely been my favorite in terms of durability material and price. They're super comfortable and not see through at all. I have thicker calves than the average girl and have always struggled to find capri pants that won't rise up to my knees once I start moving and these leggings definitely rest perfectly mid-calf during my workouts. Shipping also was MUCH faster than expected so that was a big bonus. I'll definitely be re-ordering in as many colors as I can :)",1

It hugs my hips and totally erases my waistline when worn that way (see 1st picture).However this is SO CUTE as a slouchy shirt like I'm wearing in my other 2 photos so it ended up not being a disappointment at all.

I highly recommend these to all my fellow service industry workers.Side note: I also bought the Superfeet orange love them too they are similar to the greens but have a much softer foam on the front of your foot. I prefer the greens for work (walking) and the orange for high impact (running). Hope that helps.",1

Davenport,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've been a faithful Superfeet user for many years. I use them in all my shoes - dress causal and running. Because I run ultra-marathons they take punishment beyond what a normal athlete would be able to dole out (see picture). Despite the thin-looking appearance they have served me much better than any custom insole ever has (and I've had several!). For me I found that the arch support is just enough. It takes a couple minutes to cut each one to size but all you have to do is take out the manufacturer's insert and trace around it...not rocket science :-),1
Women,B0032ALZL8,Superfeet Premium Shoe Insoles Green,        14 of 14 people found the following review helpful       They are much harder than the standard insoles that come with sneakers and I don't feel as if the arch support reaches far enoug  March 31  2016By gingerlover,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been struggling with plantar fasciitis and bought these to replace the insoles in my workout shoes on the recommendation of a friend who had used them.  They are much harder than the standard insoles that come with sneakers and I don't feel as if the arch support reaches far enough in toward the center of my foot to provide good support. I finally went to the podiatrist a few weeks ago and purchased the insole they recommend the Powerstep PRO Protech full length and wish I had purchased them first instead of the Superfeet!  The arch on the Powerstep insole reaches in to the middle of my foot and provides far superior support to my arch than the Superfeet did and they have a cushier feel while still providing excellent support.  Also they were about $10 cheaper.  (A tip to pass on to anyone who may be suffering with plantar fasciitis...one of the things my podiatrist recommended that I had NOT been doing on my own was to apply heat (NOT ICE) to my foot and this has helped tremendously in conjunction with rolling my arch on a baseball and stretching daily!),0

We tried cork and felt. The felt is more comfortable and the cork provides more support (but was more difficult to glue on). So far after several weeks using both for hiking and long walks - no problems. I just use thicker socks with the cork added insoles.,1

February 20  2016By MariamG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These green Superfeet are made for those with high arches. They make different colors for different types of support based on the curvature of your arches. I originally got a pair from Road Runner Sports where you can get fitted for shoes based on your step. They have you walk on a treadmill with cameras on your step to tell what type of shoe support you need...At the time I was training for a marathon and didn't have the funds for high end orthotics. Based on my chiropractors' recommendation to stay away from any that are very flexible these seemed like a good supportive set.These are not cozy or comfortable in fact they feel almost rock hard. However they are extremely supportive and hand washable. I have sets I've owned through marathons I've ran as well as 60 mile walks. These things don't break down after hundreds of miles and years of use.I bought this set as a gift for my brother who has Plantar Fasciitis. Sizing is accurate and you cut them down around the toes as instructed (if needed). Excellent product and I'm constantly recommending them to others.They work best in shoes you've removed the insoles in but are okay without doing so in most. In some they'd make it a bit too tight without removing the original insoles but every shoe differs.These are not for high heels but they do make a black set I own and would also recommend that is made for high heels. For around $40 I think these green Superfeet are a godsend for anyone who can't stand flats because they need high arch support. Highly recommended. Smile. Hope this is helpful!,0

These insoles have made a measurable difference. I still have some soreness but it is greatly reduced and I have no problems with that 15 foot stroll at 3AM.It took about a week to adjust the the shape on my foot and it wasn't always pleasant but totally worth the week of a bit of discomfort as my feet adjusted for the comfort they have provided since.An antidote I will add... I was trying on a nice pair of Allen Edmonds at one of their stores and the salesman told me he has had several customers who use them and had heard good things about them as well.,0

These are really inconsistent for how expensive they are. Not worth the money. I've toughed it out for a few weeks with these as replacements in my nice Thorogood mock toe workboots thinking maybe they would break in and start feeling more comfortable but they haven't. They fit perfectly inside the boots. However the arch support on the left footbed feels like it's way too far back on my heel without enough room in the heel area. The right one feels like it fits right but still isn't very comfortable. They're hard and uncomfortable. I have a high arch and it looks like these should fit my feet just right and feel good but they're just super uncomfortable in all the wrong places. The quality of the materials isn't anything special I can't believe they charge this much for something that must be super cheap to manufacture and that seems to have poor quality control.,0
Women,B0032ALZL8,Superfeet Premium Shoe Insoles Green,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Over priced and does not really fit.  Comes with too little information.  May 31  2015By P89ybb02,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These very expensive insoles are just ok.  I also reviewed the blue ones since people were commenting that greens were for high arches.  I do not find that to be true at all.I have moderate arches using the water test.  I am looking (still) for arch support as are so many others.  We can go to the moon but still not get good arch support.  What is up with that?The greens which I currently have would fit more or less if the arch were farther up the insole towards the toe.  It is situated pretty far back towards the heel so the support only fits part of the arch.  There seems to be a standardized foot that is used by Superfeet as a pattern and it doesn't resemble mine very much.I also have the Powersteps and the Sole.  The Powersteps are pretty comfortable and pretty supportive.  The Soles are thick and reasonably supportive but barely fit in shoes because they are too thick.  Buy everything online because local retailers were selling the Soles for double the online price!I am at a loss to understand why the Superfeet cost almost as much as a pair of shoes.  They have some support but they do not really fit well and there seems to be little to no information on the Superfeet website as to how to get them to work...or not.  Perhaps they really only fit a subsection of feet and mine are not included.I am seriously miffed at spending lots of cash and still end up looking for insoles.,0

August 14  2015By Rusty80,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I ordered  the size I thought would fit for Columbia products. This is my second item from Columbia and each time I'm getting a size smaller than usual. Based on the size chart it's accurate. Meaning I fit within the SMALL measurements and the jacket isn't tight on me. Most other brands I would have ordered a Medium.  I ordered a small so that I could wear with with a long sleeve shirt under it but not planning on wearing a sweatshirt / sweater under it. I'm 5'8"" 120# 34A chest. I like this jacket and plan to use it during outdoor activities like camping hiking and canoeing in the Fall. The material is very comfortable and I love that the pockets zip up. They also have what could be considered two pockets on the inside of the jacket. My husband really liked this jacket too so I ordered him the male version.  It's a great find for around $20 on sale.Update / Re-Order:I decided to order another size and color. My previous order was brown / small. For a more relaxed look I decided to get the ""sunnyside"" yellow in medium. The medium fits me as well as the small but it depends on what I'm planning on using the jacket for. I chose the medium because I'll be using it as a relaxed layering piece. Technically I could wear this as my size but it's not as fitted as I would like it to be.The color ""sunnyside"" is more of a true sun baby yellow.  Not necessarily pastel baby yellow either but compared to my lemon juice bottle yellow crayon and Penn tennis ball it is more pastel in color.  When I first saw it I thought ""Care Bear"" stuffed animal colored. The picture from Amazon seems to show a hue of green in the garment that I don't see in person.  It's not a shocking neon yellow either. To me it's a true ""yellow"" even though my ""yellow"" crayon shows a hue of green to it next to the jacket. I have photos attached that will show the jacket in true sun and two with all three items laying on the jacket. The ones with the items laying on the jacket are in a pitch dark room with only the Samsung S5 camera flash for light. The true sun photos seem to lighten the color of the jacket. Hope this helps.",1

I am 5'6 and am a size 10 but can range from an 8-12 depending on brand of clothing. I wasn't sure which size to get after reading such varying reviews so I got both sizes but in different colors in case I liked them both.  Both jackets fit but had some minor noticeable differences.  The Medium was more fitted and had less give in the front waist and hips when zipping up. I can comfortably wear t-shirts and tank tops under the Medium. It was also more figure flattering. The Large had more room all over when zipping and I can comfortably wear it over a long sleeve shirt or sweatshirt. This one is great for layering but the look and feel are more loose; however I am definitely not swimming in it as other reviews have said. I am keeping both because they wash well are comfortable and are great for different purposes. Both arm lengths seemed pretty even and roomy especially considering they have the elastic wrists. So in summary if you are not sure what size to get or are in between sizes the smaller size will be more fitted with a flattering look and the larger size will offer more room and options for layering.,0

December 5  2016By Jacob Hoffmann,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The fabric is not a jersey knit type fabric as it appears in the picture. It is more of a slinnky clingy fabric. It does have a silky feel to it which is not how it appears in the picture. Also I think if you are larger than a B cup the seams of this dress fall in the front in a way that is not flattering. I was definitely disappointed when I pulled this out of the package and it didn't look like the dress in the picture.. The sleeves also were pretty baggy.

I recommend them and would definitely buy again- although they are so sturdy I might never need to!Update: I ordered these again since I liked them so much. Unfortunately although I just selected ""buy again"" I did not receive the same product. I should have realized there was a problem when I was told that this time they were coming from China. The packaging was different and so was the product. These gel pads are thinner and the Peds themselves are smaller and cut into my heels. I am not satisfied with this product switch. I would like to know how to get the original product again. I am disappointed in Amazon-a very rare thing. Thus I changed my rating from five to two stars.9/5 update. The ""secret substitute"" Peds are horrible. They shrank when washed and are painful to wear. I got no response from the supplier so I am down-rating them again. I won't order these ever again.",0

Because they're a bit more substantial they're very comfortable and I love the tab on the back. I'm so glad I ordered 6 pair! They're perfect for my shoes for work and the tab makes it so they stay on my feet instead of bunching up into the toe of my shoe. Highly recommend!!,0

August 15  2015By Chrissy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love these liners! They stay in place better than others I have purchased the small tab on the heel does it's job very well. With the shoes I wear them with you can't see them at all. I wear a size 10 and sometimes 11 in women's shoes and I purchase the size 8-12. They fit perfect and are really stretchy and comfortable. I've bought other ones that fit but would feel really uncomfortable on my toes after wearing them for half a day. The material feels soft and after washing them and even putting them in the dryer they didn't shrink or become too tight! The price for these is also more than reasonable I've seem some that were $7 for one pair! These are the best I've ever had and you get 6 pairs for $13 you can't beat it! Fantastic purchase I am so happy!,0

November 18  2016By jms,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Not bad. These types of socks have a tendency to slip off and these are no exception although they aren't as bad on account of the little rubber grip pad at the ankle. The slipping off mostly happens when I'm wearing these with the wrong shoes- shoes in which I should wear normal socks. With low cut flats they stay on. I specifically bought these to wear with some classic Keds slip ons. They work really well with those coming up to just the right level to be virtually hidden but to still protect from edge rub. I wear an 8 in shoes and have no fit problems with these. They are very stretchy so they should work for most sizes.,0

I exercise most days of the week and I mostly use the treadmill and elliptical. With the treadmill I ALWAYS have hot spots on the bottoms of my feet and that just makes me want to quit sooner than I should. They HURT! I decided to do some research on shoes and socks that were supportive and comfortable...and for ME they have to be DURABLE. That's when I found Balega. I read the reviews and finally decided to pay crazy money (or so I thought at the time) for a SINGLE PAIR of socks! ""UNHEARD OF"" I thought. But...you usually get what you pay for...so I decided to see if these were as exceptional as they seemed. AND THEY ARE. OH MY GOSH. They are THE BEST PAIR OF SOCKS I HAVE EVER HAD. They are soft comfortable supportive cushiony (I know that's not a word but let's pretend it is) on the bottom and in the back (no blisters!) and they let your feet BREATHE. I no longer get hot spots! And in fact my feet felt SO GREAT the first time I wore them that I ACTUALLY RAN ON THE TREADMILL! That's something I've never felt comfortable doing. So not only do these help my feet feel great while exercising but they are ACTUALLY going to help me reach my goals faster by allowing me to do more in my exercise! What could be better?? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. :) Thanks Balega!",0

February 27  2016By LMS1115,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I went by the sizes in the product description and ordered a medium since I am a female with a size 8 shoe. When I received them I noticed the sizing on the product was different: according to the company I should've ordered a small.  They seemed ok when I put them on so I thought it would still work - it was just half a size off right? I wore them for the first time this morning when I ran 5.5 miles and I felt like I had two blisters coming up on my toes. The only thing I can think of is that they're slightly big so they were rubbing more than they would normally.  They seem to be great socks though and I might consider ordering a small next time.  Just wanted everyone to be aware.,1
Women,B01GRQQE82,Balega Hidden Comfort Athletic Running…,        13 of 14 people found the following review helpful       Comparative review of five Balega sock models  July 26  2016By GuidoFamily,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have a number of pairs of Balega socks which I've worn for running and the Soft Tread is my favorite overall. Here's a few comparative thoughts.I've bought five different types of Balega socks in total:Balega Soft Tread No Show (Balega Soft Tread No Show - Royal BAL8926)Balega Ultralight No Show (Balega Ultralight No Show Socks - Royal Blue/White - Small)Balega Hidden Contour (Balega Hidden Contour Socks Black/Yellow Large)Balega Hidden Comfort -- THIS PRODUCTBalega Blister Resist No Show (Balega Blister Resist No Show Socks White Large)The Balega Ultralight are very thin and rather smaller--especially in comparison to the other models. I've bought size Large in every sock and they vary quite a bit. (For reference I normally wear a men's 10 though I wear 11s for running.) If you like thin small socks you may like the ultralight. Or go a size big if you want them to fit more comfortably.On the other hand the Blister Resist were way too thick and large. They had so much excess material that they felt horrible and my feet moved around in them. They are very hot. The material on the top of the foot is actually very thin but the bottom makes up for it. That said They make a comfortable sock to walk around in on my wood floors in the winter. Since I won't run in them I give them use around the house.The Hidden Contour and Hidden Comfort are similar. The Hidden Comfort are a tad thicker. They are both a bit thicker and larger than the Soft Tread socks but they are comfortable and nicer for winter weather when I tend to wear them running. If I were buying more I'd go for the Hidden Comfort. Mine have stayed superbly comfortable longer than the Hidden Contour and still feel more padded.I like the Soft Tread best (for running) because they are thick enough to be padded and comfortable but I have to pull them snug on my feet so there is no room for my feet to move against the sock. Also they are not so thick that I feel my feet get hot -- and I run in 100 degree Texas summer weather. Finally the Soft Tread are made R and L foot specific which I've found to be helpful for fit. The Ultralights are as well but not the other three models if I recall correctly. Though the Hidden Comfort came with an L on each sock that stands for ""Large"" not ""Left"". Also the heel tabs on a lot of these sock models including this one are great and do a lot to make sure the sock stays in place.Hopefully this review helps a few folks decide what Balega sock might be best for them if they're looking to purchase. If you have questions comment and I'll try to answer them.",0

September 8  2016By Gypsy Lady,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm a thick and curvy webcam model... and it is kinda hard to find products that fit me properly and still add to the sexy look I'm going for.These are the BEST stockings I've discovered for my thick thighs. I ordered close to 7 different pairs of stockings when I was searching for something that would fit. Dreamgirl Plus Size were the ONLY ones that fit me. ALL of the ones I ordered were ""Plus Size"" or ""Queen""... and made it look like my legs were getting pinched off. Then I tried Dreamgirl and I haven't looked back!I love the silicone under the lace at the top... helps keep them up. Of course after a few times of using them they need to be hand washed in cold water to keep the silicone sticky. Obviously your skin particles and sweat are going to get the silicone dirty and they will start rolling/sliding down after just a few seconds of movement. Keep them clean and they stay up every time.The ONLY complaint I really have is that I wish the nylon material was a bit better quality.This is the second pair of these that I have purchased and I only had the first pair for about 3 months before they got a run in them.So it would be nice if the material were thicker and of better quality... but for the price... I can't complain to much. lolMy roommate was kind enough to do my laundry for me one weekend while I was gone.... and she washes in HOT WATER. She also doesn't separate her clothes into delicates etc. So... these got washed in hot water and then put in the dryer. (Love her to death but... NO!)So after that the silicone was cracked and didn't stick as well. DO NOT WASH IN THE WASHING MACHINE UNLESS YOU USE COLD WATER. Or just hand wash them. Super quick and easy. DO NOT DRY THEM IN THE DRYER... let them air dry!They look sexy and fit well on a tick woman. If you're considering it.... consider no more... do it!",1

It did not matter in the end though as the stockings ripped when I caught my foot on something sharp. I am not going to leave a negative review for them ripping though as all women who have worn stockings made out of ""traditional"" stocking material should know they rip easy and to take precautions. For now I will stick to full waist stockings and stockings with garter belts I feel more comfortable in them and dont have to worry about them falling down as much.

Scrubs always seem to run large so I ordered a XXS TALL. They fit like a glove. Not a whole lot of room left but that's how I like them and they are long and drag on the ground a little but hat how I like it because being taller I have issues with having scrubs being  short. A XXS regular would probably be too short (because the smaller the size that is ordered the shorter the inseam) I have ordered a S TALL before in this brand and they were super huge on me especially in the butt and thigh area that's why I went with the XXS instead of XS.  They are not a stretchy material but not stiff either. These are the best fitting scrubs I have and I have ordered more than 1 pair because it is hard to find TALLS.,0

The material is not particularly soft but it's comfortable. Especially if you have to run around in them all day. In terms of different scrub brands this is my second favorite (Grey's being the first mostly due to how soft the fabric is). I'm 5'7 and the regular length is perfect for me. Size wise I think if you're an average woman a medium is good if you're slim definitely go for a small (as there's a lot of room for expansion) and if you're a size 14 and above go for large.,0

These are usually a pretty easy fit. In most jeans I wear a size 20 or 22 and the 2X in these pants is a nice comfortable and slightly roomy.I wear 2X in most of the Cherokee Workwear Core Stretch pants and they are usually a more snug fit. Comparing to another brand the 2X has a similar fit on me to Koi Lindsey pants in size 3X.These have been a go to pant for years for me.Pros: the price the roomy fit.Cons: no stretch no cargo pocket and they tend to wear down easily where my thighs touch while walking.,0
Women,B005D5XB4Y,Cherokee Women's Fashionable…, Okay for basic scrub pants  but skimps on the quality.  January 31  2017By SaraBearaVerified Purchase(What's this?),2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I usually wear an US size 22 Tall so I was really happy that this was offered in a 3X tall.  However when I got these I was slightly dissapointed.First I am 5'10 so I didn't expect the Talls to be so long on me!!!! The tall size was about 5"" too long- even in heels (which I wouldn't wear working). But I liked the fit well enough so I returned them and got the average length.When I got the average length they were good on length but the fit felt entirely different. The crotch length was way too long and no amount of adjusting the tightness of the drawstring helps.Second the fabric is really stiff and not very flexible. I have a shirt that matches these pants and from experience I know it softens up a little with washing but these were way scratchier than the shirt that I have.Third these are a lot thinner than I expected. Thank goodness I got the black because if you buy them in a lighter color your undies may very well show through.These are an okay basic scrub pants but for the price I'd expect a better fit. The cheap $6 pair of scrub bottoms from walmart are much comfier and thicker than this.I'm returning them and buying a different pair.",0

After reading all the reviews saying they ran huge I ordered mine a size down from what I might have. They fit ok and loosen up after a little wear but are a little snug at first in some places when I bend. lol  Not sure if I'd order a size up next time or not having worn them that long yet. I didn't know they were considered ""scrubs"" when I was looking at them at first. I was just looking for some basic light-weight casual flares that weren't yoga pants or roll-over waisted or sweats. These are pretty much what I was looking for. I got petite -I am a little over 5'- and they were a couple inches too long but that's nothing new for me. I was pleased there were so many size options and also that the pants have pockets. Happy I found these.",0

Nonetheless I was highly annoyed to have to walk around with my pants dragging on the ground causing me to walk on them AND trip on them.  Not to mention the quality i have come to expect from Cherokee was clearly lacking.  the fabric was very think et rough to the touch-reminding me of low quality sheets you get in the Bed-in-a Bag sets at Walmart.  Typically if i want a cheap pair of scrub pants I can find them for $6-10...NOT $16-esp when it appears they wear made from cheap sheet material and then add the wrong size? Apparently the quality of Cherokee was went downhill in recent yrs&their order processor cannot distinguish between the words 'small' and 'small petite'.  I VERY seldom write a negative review-thinking i have MAYBE one other time i did in my 67+yrs as an Amazon Prime member. VERY disappoint et angry.,0

The fabric is thin and cool - but not so thing where it is sheer or lacks proper coverage. In my opinion it is the absolute perfect top for those warm days.One of my favorite things about this tank is that while it is perfect to wear during my yoga and workout sessions; I have found that I can easily ""dress it up"" by layering it over a camisole and wearing it with a maxi skirt and pretty necklace. I threw on a short sleeved shrug and I got tons of compliments from my co-workers on how nice I looked.Now that I know just how fabulous these tanks are I am already purchasing more in different colors to brighten up my summer wardrobe.

If you're a little jiggly in the belly like me all this does is enhance the view of your love handles. And if you're taller the crotch less panty part isn't exactly in the right area. And being busty this just barely covers your nipples and forget trying to move and keep em in place at the same time. It's just pretty much awkward looking and uncomfortable.

It's so hard to find yoga pants that fit well especially in length and not being see-through in the butt. After reading the reviews I decided it wouldn't hurt to try so I ordered a L and it arrived a week later. Like most I was concerned about how small they looked right out of the package. But the material seemed sturdy and they ended up slipping on like a glove. They are perfect in length and fit well! Flattering shape and perfect breathable material. There's still a bit of transparency in the back side but that's something I'll have to deal with forever longer tank tops and dark thongs help make it less obvious if not indecipherable. The ""fold over""  part is really short in my opinion and they make them a little too low cut in the back to be comfortable so I just keep it folded up and wear them like higher wasted pants. I'm not sure how they will hold up after a few washes but for the price I'd rate 5 stars. They remind me of a pair of yoga pants I bought years ago that I spent almost $50 on! Definitely recommend I will be buying more.",0

I'm 110lbs and 5'6 1/2 but most of my height is in my legs so I wear the same length pants as someone who's 5'8. I usually buy my yoga pants from target (XS) but the length is not as long as I like so I have to stretch them out wverytime I wash them. Eventually this leaves holes in the material from stretching them so much and I have to buy new ones. I wear a size XS long in Victoria secret and even those require stretching after I send them through dryer. These pants are the first to fit my leg length perfectly! They are also more flared at the bottom so they don't make my feet look as big! The hug your thighs and flare out a little below your knee cap. I'm obsessed! I purchased 2 black and will be purchasing more of other colors now. I'm attaching a picture of the band pulled all the way up as well as the band folded down like I usually wear them. The black ones i'm wearing are a size small. I also ordered them only 4 days ago. Awesome shipping time!,1

I would not recommend these to a friend. I purchased in hopes to use them during first trimester pregnancy. I tried them on as soon as I received them and they fit accordingly they were long enough and they fit well. I didn't like the super cottony feel of them and they were a tad bit stiff with little give. I washed them according the instructions and keep in mind I NEVER wash in hot water always cold and I never dry on high heat only low or extra low. They SHRUNK at least two sizes after I washed them. They are no longer long enough and they are too tight to wear now. I was super disappointed so I contacted the company and they told me there was nothing they could do and that I only had 30 days to return them. Most companies stand by their products and offer returns so another disappointment. Would not recommend this product.,0

January 4  2016By MegNic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just received these boots today and I am over the moon for them. Aside from a quick trip to the bus stop I haven't really given them a full hike yet but they are fantastic so far and incredibly warm with full insulation. The color is fantastic and not accurate in the preview images. I've included a few images for a more accurate reference.,1

Perfect for people with big calves  too.  December 1  2016By nursethalia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I live in the Pacific Northwest and our winters are very wet and very cold! I decided to splurge and finally buy myself some nice snow boots. These boots are true to size so I bought a size 7.5 (I am either 7.5 or 8 in women's shoes depending on the brand) and they fit me perfectly even with my wide feet and with thick fluffy socks on. I like that these are adjustable and fit my enormous calves just fine - plus you only need to adjust the laces once. After that you just use the zipper to take them on and off.I bought the grey boots and I absolutely love them! Note that the product photo colors are not accurate - they actually look WAY better in person. The grey material is darker and the yellow leather is actually a tan (I saw other customer photos before purchasing so I knew what to expect). I've worn these out in the rain and the snow multiple times and my feet were dry and warm the entire time. They are also very comfortable and this is coming from someone who spends the rest of the year in memory-foam slip-on flats.I have gotten so many compliments on these boots. They really are gorgeous. They look great with fleece-lined leggings!,1

These boots stayed warm and dry the entire time I was outside despite the snow being as deep as they are tall. They truly are waterproof and seem to be holding up nicely. They look nice aren't too bulky to be fashionable and are really comfortable. They don't feel too clunky to wear as street shoes after you shovel snow.,0

The zipper is nice for putting on quickly. The ties in the front I thought were just decorative but are great for widening the portion on your lower leg. This is helpful if needing more room to tuck jeans into for thick socks or if you have larger calves.The foot portion is a little stiff I've had them three days and am trying to loosen them up. They are warm for sure.Update: they have loosened up. Good fit. They have been warm as dry when walking through snow and shoveling.,1

The whole inside is insulated including the top inside of the toe.Color- I got the yellow ones and it's not really yellow I'd call it tan or brown mustard.Fit- fits as expected. Loose enough that I can wear a pair of thick warm socks and it fits nicely. They are also easy to take on and off with the zipper.Comfort- soft and lightweight. Footbed is cushy not much arch support.,1

January 1  2017By Kathleen Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Somehow I got these boots for $4 as an add on item and i assumed they would be junk. I took a trip to the snow today thinking I would purchase quality boots later they do make a crunching sound and appear to be thin cheap material but I was extremely pleasantly surprised! A whole day playing in the snow and my feet stayed warm and dry they do not feel cheap once they are on. I am thrilled with them and wont be wasting more money on expensive boots. Actually  my wife was wearing a $150 pair of sorrel boots and complained that her toes were cold! Even if i paid the full price of $50 i would say well worth it.,0

And he puts in a lot of miles.  And these are great for the chaffing.  As in - no more chaffing.  He likes these so much and they fit SO well I bought him another pair in another color (he likes the camo ones).  He loves the green color of the first pair I bought him and the look of these on.  He loves the way they feel on and that they are not so long that they peek through the bottom of his running shorts.For reference he is 5'4"" 13 years old and ~115lbs.  I got him a size small and they are snug but not tight.  They fit how I'd imagine they are supposed to.",0

I use it for Jiu Jitsu although I can see using it for running or any other physical sport where you need compression. It keeps me dry. I am about a 34-36 and I got an XL. It fits well although I feel like I might probably get away with wearing a large. Not sure how much more compression I would get by going down a size but the xl still fits well enough for me to roll/run and not have any issues.,0

They promptly issued me a refund for my purchase (even though I didn't want one) and that was that.  All I had wanted to do was to return the product and exchange it for an item that wasn't defective.  However they took their customer service to a whole new level and just gave me my money back.  Which I instantly used to purchase another pair of short today and have them sent out.  After I receive I will update this review after using them for a week.  However I am very pleased with the customer service at this point.**ORIGINAL REVIEW**I first tried to contact the company with my issue but since there seems to be no way to do so I am leaving this review.  I have been purchasing Tesla products off Amazon for a while and I really like them.  They fit to size very well and the are a great value overall.This experience was different however.  First off the color of the product is brown or a gray with green strips but the picture makes it look like an off black color so that was strike one.  I can get over that though because I wear these under my Tesla running shorts or under my Tesla compression pants.But then I put them on.  They fit as do my other pairs but the seam on the right side was split and open. Basically I have shorts that I cant use and can find no way to return or exchange them.  I am very frustrated.,0

As they are compression shorts and not underwear you would be better supported with a sports brief or jock strap to keep everything where you want them to be at the gym (otherwise you may require constant readjustment). I wear a US medium normally and I ordered the US medium from the site (even though there seems to be a lot of people who say to get a size or two up) and the medium fits perfectly (I'm 5'8 and 180 lbs).I also like how you can get matching tops and bottoms unlike under armour or most other compression and sportswear lines. I have the navy/bright green royal blue/light blue and the gray/black and wear them under my gym shorts and t-shirts.,0

October 21  2016By Rincewind,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My waist is 34.  Large fits snugly but not too tight.  Legs stayed in place and did not ride up.  Fabric is slick and somewhat shiny reminiscent of 90's biker shorts but w/o any padding.  The seams are stitched well and do not rub or scratch the skin.  There is no fly.  Would prefer a slightly wider waist band elastic strip to prevent it folding over when bending over (probably not a problem if my stomach was flatter).  It appears that a compression baselayer short is in reality nice looking underwear.  Does show off quads nicely but this fact is not apparently appreciated by everyone.  You'd think a package liquor store wouldn't be so judgy about dresscodes but they thought compression baselayer shorts were underwear too.  Ah well...they look nice keep everything cool and dry whether you wear pants or not.,0
Women,B016MWRQK6,Tesla Men's Cool Dry Compression Baselayer…,        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       Reasonable compression shorts for the price  November 10  2016By M,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These are decent compression shorts. I usually wear either the UA Mesh Boxerjock or Nike Pro Combat ones as boxers and not necessarily for athletics. The fit on these is good although there's not much support for your important bits. The construction feels okay but not quite on par with the UA or Nikes so for a few extra dollars I'd recommend either of those instead. If the price of those is a deal-breaker for you then these are quite alright aside from a very long and invasive tag on the inside. Seriously it's almost 2017 there should never ever be a physical tag in any pair of underwear at this point. Manufactures need to print the info directly on the inside of the fabric and save people having to cut them out or deal with the discomfort.,0
Women,B016MWRQK6,Tesla Men's Cool Dry Compression Baselayer…, This brand was stumbled upon to find better workout clothing for the gym other than Walmart  February 20  2017By Carlos GiraldoVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This brand was stumbled upon to find better workout clothing for the gym other than Walmart. This is my first time with the brand Tesla and found that the prices are equal with Walmart but the quality is far better. Like any other pair of shorts there is a lockstitch style at the waist line that is reinforced on the inside. The non-abrasive fabric is stretched section by section to keep it together giving it more reinforcement and better contour of your body. (This is much better than a 1 section piece of fabric). I'm 5'11"" 160lbs with a 30"" waist and 24"" thighs and purchased the medium size compression shorts. Once I tried them on they were a tad snug and had to break them in for a day while at the gym. They held up very well and gave comfortable movement throughout my workout. (They will show your package). The great part of these shorts was the quick dry wicking material which kept me cool during the workout. As for washing these shorts I recommend you put them with like clothing (polyester or spandex) on low wash and very little detergent. Do not try to dry these in the dryer just hang them up to air dry which only takes about 30 minutes on a hanger (This depends on where you live.) Overall I give these compression shorts two thumbs up and will stick to Tesla. Now I have to try their compression shirts.",0

I wish the small was longer and they would be perfect.  I put my height and weight in so it makes it easier for people to figure out the right size.  If your like me and you read the reviews some say the product runs big and some say small.  The ones with the persons height and weight helped a lot.  Also one other thing is if you wear these without shorts over top and you sweat a lot they get wet or you decide to swim in them they can or will be see through depending how wet they get.",0
Women,B016MWRQK6,Tesla Men's Cool Dry Compression Baselayer…, Second order of Tesla gear and still happy  February 15  2017By David BrownleeVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I ordered this product after ordering Tesla's cold gear tops & bottoms.  This brand makes a great product comparable to name brands for a fraction of the cost.  This material is also obviously a little thinner than the cold gear version.  I ordered the same size (medium) as I did for the cold gear but these are a little more snug than those.  Specifically the waist band is a little more snug but still perfectly functional for my liking.  I'm about 5'9"" 165lbs and wear a size 32 waist for comparison. Though the mediums are a little snug I think the Large would be a little too loose in the thigh for me personally. I am using these for training and prefer a snug compression feeling.  So I'd say if you are a 32"" waist you are right on the border between Large and Medium so just decide if you want more compression for athletics or a little looser for daily under garment use.All that being said my cold has held up great after my first couple of uses under my jiu jitsu gi so i'd expect the same level of durability and will update after a couple of uses and washes.",0

October 11  2016By JadeEclypse,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Haven't noticed a whole lot of ""waist training"" mainly because I am already an hour glass shape.

I am 5'10 consider myself a tall woman there's nothing short about me and I will never be described as 'petite' but this thing covered from my hips all the way way up under my breasts.This would have been good but the front and back are almost the same length. If the back went up that high but the front dipped down more it would have been perfect. I gave it 4 stars because the top without some serious adjustment (and I wear super expensive supportive bras because I'm a 40F cup) was right under my boobs and almost covering them which is not entirely comfortable. The other reason I gave 4 stars was that the colors are not as appear I know there are variations because of screen resolutions blah blah blah but the purple is straight up pink and the pink is hot pink there really isn't a 'purple'.",0

If you're looking for it to give you shape like I was I'd order your typical Juniors size. I don't know yet how it will hold up to washing.,1

I had many compliments on it as well!I'm 5'8"" approx. 210 lbs C-cup and I went with what other reviews has suggested and ordered big. I normally wear an XL in womens too. Due to the reviews I ordered a 3XL. While it's pretty and flowy (if that's even a word :) ) I wish I would have gotten a 2XL. I never wear my clothes tight but I feel like I'm kinda swimming in the 3XL. Maybe it will shrink a little in the dryer? I'll definitely be ordering more!I hope this review helps with future orders! :)",0

My only problem is that it did shrink lengthwise when I washed and dried it. The fabric is thin and comfortable. The neck is not too tight which is an issue I have with normal tshirts.It can be worn alone or under scrubs. I bought the Caribbean blue which is a little darker than a lot of scrub brands (Cherokee wonderwink). I would say it's pretty true to the product picture.I ordered another one in black :)Pics shown in Adar Caribbean blue shirt with Cherokee Caribbean blue pants.",1

Snug to the body but not sucking the air out.  Just what I wanted to go under my scrubs.  I don't like lose sleeves so this is great.  Long enough to tuck in and not crawl up when I'm bending and shifting.  Moves with me!  I'm a bit on the heavy side and it doesn't look like I'm wrapped in saran wrap either.  Can't wait to purchase other colors.  Good quality and price!,0

I was just looking for a quality basic cotton long sleeve shirt at a great rate and these are certainly that. I think its made with shorter arms for that reason being it doesn't get in the way of nurses or doctors while working but for me I do have longer arms and I like my sleeves to be even longer so that would be the only fault but again its my fault for not noticing the kind of shirt it was. Ohherwise feels nice I ordered 3 colors grey white and purple in size Medium and they fit perfect arrived right on time as well.,0

February 18  2017By Keissa L. Lark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've been trying to find replacement shirts to wear under my scrubs. This shirt fits very well without adding to much bulk.  It is a bit sheer but again with wearing under scrubs I'm not really too concerned about that.  I stay warm enough in my office (which sets the ambient office temperature somewhere near arctic tundra) without needing to add my lab coat. As I've only had it for about a week I'll update once there has been more consistent wear and tear and multiple cleanings.  So far I'd recommend it to anyone needing an additional layer without wanting to feel too bulky.,0

January 25  2017By Psych NurseVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I like this shirt to wear under my scrubs. I have a similar shirt made by another brand that I like much better due to the material it is made from. This Adar shirt is a cotton long sleeved tee shirt that is thin enough to work well under scrubs without overheating you. There is not a lot of stretch to it at all which is why it's not my absolute favorite but I do like this shirt. I ordered a large to afford me a little bit of room in the shirt and I'd say it fits as expected. I am a bit larger in the chest area and am pleased with the fit. I would definitely order other colors in this shirt. For the price it cannot be beat.,0

I bought a white one to wear under some lower cut tops that I wear in the winter. It provides warmth adds a little more color to my face which I like. I am on the short-waisted side and on me it is longish in the torso so that it shows on the bottom for a layered look which is something else like about it. I've washed it twice and it washed beautifully. It is super comfortable and has no tags to irritate or try to take off. I am thinking about buying more of them in different colors.,0

Women,B01DSHDF8U,Aenlley Women's Activewear Yoga Pants…, My day-to-day leggings  great for hourglassy folks  February 8  2017By AnnaBelleVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've bought SEVERAL pairs of these for regular use over the past year. 5'4'' 45'' hips 28'' waist thick legs. I've worn the medium and the large sizes comfortably. The medium hugs me better stays up better during physical activity and for me it wasn't see-through until it had been washed MANY times. The large slipped around a lot on me so I prefer not to exercise in them and I do recommend sizing down.Medium wouldn't reach the ankles of someone taller than 5'7'' I'd say the length goes up with the size. The gray ones do hit just a little bit lower on the waist than the black ones and they don't have the name brand on the hip. And I sincerely doubt that these are 50% cotton they're a very slippy slightly shiny material. But they're still my everyday legging and ideal for yoga and weight routines and I love to wear them with crop tops.,0

The back side is silver filigree and it could be worn with either side facing out!  I have worn it to work twice and  have received compliments on it each time.  This is a piece I bought for myself because it struck me as beautiful - I'm not one to wear anything but my wedding ring and a religious medal in the way of jewelry. The only change I would make would be the length of the chain as I prefer longer necklaces - but that is just a personal preference and easily remedied.  Met and exceeded my expectations!

June 27  2016By PAChristine,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm not a fan of huge flare-legged pants.  In an XL the flares on many pant styles are large enough to fit my entire shoe inside... while I'm standing.

I just wanted some regular straight-up scrub pants with a cargo pocket... is that too much to ask??These mostly meet my desires.  At 5'4 many scrubs tend to be long for my legs but these are actually ok. I wish the ankle were just slightly more boot-cut but it's really ok.  The elastic is fine and I like that they're higher-waisted.  This keeps me from mooning people when I bend over or even just sit.  Say no to crack right?

They are beautiful coloring and match the cherokee line scrub tops perfectly so far. (this color matches pretty much all Hello Kitty tops!) I love that it has elastic so it comes in at the waist instead of feeling like I'm pulling up a big tent on myself like the draw string pants do. When I sit the pants stay up and I don't have that super tight at the seams feeling that I get in other brands. I ordered a size up because I have had issues with pants starting to give at the seams early on but now I wish I had ordered my real size because the waistline is generous for an elastic waistband! These pants fit nicely but I do get the feeling that when I bend over they might be out of place so i find myself pulling them up habitually before I bend over in front of someone. I wish these had a drawstring in the elastic like the mens do. But for the price and fit they are much better than most scrub pants I've tried. I only order these style in womens because my favorite scrub pant the Mens workwear cargo elastic drawstring pants don't carry the ""girlie"" colors like pinks and lighter purples. I got the regular length and they are long enough even when sitting and I'm tall. I do wish cargo pants came with a ""cellphone pocket"" that fit modern cellphones the ones that say they do have a cellphone pocket look like the fit the old school Nokia phones but not a wide and thin smartphone but otherwise these pants are exceptional. The elastic has give so order your real size not up or else you won't be able to tighten them at all.",0

April 3  2015By MGH,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,If my job as a nurse allowed me to stand still with no walking or bending over these would be fine.  Wearing the XL the pants are too snug in the thighs and make bending or squatting uncomfortable.  I tried the 2XL and they were way too large below the waistband with the crotch half way down my thighs.  With the XL the crotch still droops after moving around and I'm constantly needing to hitch up the waist of the pants- even though when bending etc. they feel too tight.  The material is lightweight but still stiff after 4-5 washings and it doesn't breathe at all adding hot to the overall discomfort level.  I've given up on these and ordered something else.  The price is great but the comfort level and fit is awful.,0

I find the material is sort of thin however and the stitching doesn't seem as strong compared to my other scrubs (I prefer Dickies). I think if you live in a hot environment the thin fabric of these pants would be good because I find in the summer these allow a little more ""breeze"" to get through than other pants. On the downside I also find these pants are not very forgiving with panty lines..but if your scrub top covers your bum then you may not have to worry about that or if your rear end is not so big then maybe it isn't noticable at all. My rear end is definitely on the large side and so that's something that I don't like about these pants. I also don't like that the pockets are very ""basic"" compared to the similarly priced Dickies. Overall I prefer my dickies but these are still comfortable pants and if you live in a hot environment or get hot while working you might benefit from the thinner fabric. I gave these 4 stars because they are very modestly priced and I didn't expect anything more than what I got but I didn't give them a 5 because I feel that the Dickies are superior quality and you are in the same price point. There's nothing wrong with these pants I wear them regularly and might buy more if I move to a warmer state but I wish the pockets were a little more organized (pens always fall out of these pockets..). These are very modestly priced and I'd still say these are FAR better than the cheapo scrub pants you can get at Walmart. Cherokee is a good brand I just have a preference for the Dickies pants.",0

I prefer these to the drawstring waist.  They wear really well but the elastic only lasts about a year.  But for scrubs that seems pretty good with weekly wear for 10 hours a day working with animals! The petite length works best for me because the normal length seems to be really long. But once I figured out what size I wear I haven't had any problems since.,0

January 26  2015By JB Shopping,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have and LOVE many GW 2 shoes this is my first GW 3 shoe.For reference my feet measure 8 WW though I often buy 8.5 W (ie Munro) because I like the extra room in the toe area or a size 9 M if wide widths are not available.I also have a high arch/instep.For Skechers GW line I had been buying size 9. With GW 2's (Hypo Super Sock and Super Breathe) the fit was amazing---the shoes are so light and cushy I didn't feel like I was wearing  shoes. No tightness (length/width/top of the foot) and no slippage either...absolutely perfect!I ordered the same size 9 for GW 3 and the fit is different like another review stated. Because of my high instep I feel tightness across the top of both feet my right in particular. This is the first time I sense a break-in period for me with this line.  I'm keeping them but will probably shop for more 2's in the future.I will update if these break-in to the level of comfort in fit that I've found in GW 2's right out of the box.If you do not have a high instep I HIGHLY recommend these shoes because the cushion factor has definitely been kicked up another notch in the GW 3 (which is why I gave a 4 instead of a 3).UPDATE: There was a very unexpected but brief break-in period for me. The overall length seems just a bit shorter than GW2 and the fit across the top of my foot is firm but it's no longer painful. The cushioned support is UNBELIEVABLE---raising my rating to a 5. I literally had no pain or fatigue at all in my feet after teaching all day---I have heel spurs weak ankles and wrestle with PF on and off----this is another GREAT shoe from the GW line!July 2015 UPDATE#2: This is kind of embarrassing but hopefully worth knowing if you go sock-less in your GW's like I do. This particular GW3 model which I have in both beige and black gets stinky. Both colors get stinky.  I have a huge collection (GW2 Hypo being my favorite and most worn) so I don't wear them day after day---they're rotated----regularly------with air-dry time (not boxed up)-----and well they stink.  Not across-the-room stink but they have an odor that my other GW2's that are older have not developed. Going back to 4 stars because I still like them for their insanely comfortable ""cushion factor."" May try them with sock liners.",0

Super comfy can walk all day in them super lightweight and they give support.  I think these are amazing shoes and recommend them to anyone who enjoys a comfortable shoe.UPDATE:  I have had this pair for about 6 months wearing them basically every day.  I finally put them to the doorway to be used as quick slip ons as the insole is not as comfortable for all day wear.  Gladly I did purchase 2 pair so I have my backup pair as the main shoe!",1

Two of us went on our lunch break.  The foam was such a pleasant surprise!  Now my feet were still hurting for a few days while wearing these (I was still recovering from the pain-it doesn't disappear that quickly) but it was a different hurt - it was a worked/tired sort of hurting from moving fast for hours at a time on concrete.  Now it has been a week and I've worn these for a total of 4 straight 9 hour days at work and I love them!  I want more - I'm waiting on them to offer them in a hunter green or a shade of green as it would match my work outfit.  I bought the navy blue/hot pink ones in the size the shoe store said I wore.  What is interesting is they said these were not offered in wide or B's or E's etc. but on here they show that they are offered in B's and E's and I would order the B since I have wide feet and high arches.My tip: is I wear performance socks with these - the type they advise people with diabetes to wear.  I do not have diabetes but my feet/ankles will swell and hold fluid due to poor circulation (just hereditary) after being on concrete all day so the performance socks squeeze my legs and help with circulation and make these super easy to slip on and off.I really appreciate the foam feel of these - very soft/squishy - really like these and I'm so glad I listened to another co-worker and tried these.  They are worth it to me because I have noticed a huge difference in my performance at work now that I'm not limping and trying to get through the last couple hours of work.  My feet are still sore but that is from a long day of hard work.These are worth it and I want more in a variety of colors.I bought these at a local shoe store  I am attaching a photo showing the shoe on one foot with the performance sock on and the other shoe beside it to shoe the inside of shoe,1

That being said I was of course really excited to get them!  They arrived in perfect condition and are adorable.  I typically wear a 6-61/2 but some converse fit me a little big and I think it makes the toe look long so I went with the 6.  I could have gone with the 6 1/2 since these are tight with thick socks... but I don't plan on wearing them with thick socks and actually plan to wear them without socks sometimes so they're absolutely perfect.  Love the slip on elastic back!  It keeps them snug on my heel and I'm one of those who rarely unties my tennis shoes anyway just slipping them on and off (I know I know it breaks down the heel cup LOL).

The white or off-white color will get dirty but they're scrubbable and dirt comes out.  I averaged 20-30K steps a day on both trips and these shoes stay on due to the elastic heel/back of the shoe without rubbing there.Cons: The stitching on the outer edge of the town box does tend to hurt my little toes but not enough to cause blistering or bleeding.  Since I don't wear socks with them and I wear them around cities multiple days in a row in hot climates they smell worse than typical athletic sneakers that you wear with socks - I bought Odor Eaters powder foot spray and that seems to work.,0

October 24  2016By Red Rock,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,A suggestion for anyone looking to find the right fit: I have a 33 inch waist. Normally I would choose a 32-34 'medium' pair of pants. When in comes to underwear I have found that I need to go up to 'large' to get a comfortable fit. I think this is due to the fact that cotton underwear will shrink after the first wash and dry. I recommend that if you intend to buy Fruit of the Loom underwear that you buy a test pack one size larger than your actual waist size.,0

Uniforms Work & Safety,B00KBJOU24,Fruit of the Loom Men's 5-Pack No Ride Up…, Corporations are Cheap  December 8  2016By Steve BellangerVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I switched to Fruit of the Loom because Hanes flat out told me they stopped making white boxers/boxer briefs. This is not because all consumers are idiots; it's not always the consumer's fault or because of demand.To a lot of us white boxers are classy clean. However when you manufacture white or lighter colors you have to use more expensive material. You will notice that black boxers only contain 75% cotton whereas whites and greys contain 100%. Thus it is cheaper to make more colors and patterns.... even though colors and patterns are for kids in my opinion. Unfortunately consumers will buy anything because they are in a bind they have no choice. I'm grateful black and grey are available in case white goes away completely some day.  Can't imagine wearing red or plaid underwear.  More expensive underwear companies always provide white boxersetc....they know class.  Hopefully Fruit of the Loom continues to make white underwear.,0

S. Grassia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been buying and wearing these FTL boxer briefs for 20 years happily.  I tried other fancier boxer briefs hoping for perhaps a bit more longevity (these do develop holes in the crotch seams after two or three years) but came back to these for the fit and comfort.  I just needed to restock this past August and ordered the same Mediums I've gotten for twenty years and they are measurably smaller than the set I bought late last year (and have not lost any elasticitiy).  They have been causing me issues though it's past the return period now.  Going to try Large I guess.,0

October 18  2016By Liam Theis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I live in New England so I need a good hat from time to time. I have a bigger head so finding a hat that fits is generally an issue. It either fits and looks dumb or doesn't fit and does protect. This hat is the solution to my troubles.The hat unlike the A205 will come right over your ears all the way. This will completely cover your ears in a double layer of fabric all around your head. The fold is adjustable so it can be as hipster beanie or tight laced as you please. The tag is easily removed if you so wish. The hat must be hand washed or it will pill and shrink like no one's business but it clearly says that on the label. Headphones will work over this hat just fine but earbuds will probably hurt as the double fabric will push them into your ears.The hat can be a little tight on the ears maybe because I have a big head but it should be noted. The hat retains moisture pretty easily. If you're inside or it's warmer than 45F expect to sweat in this hat  a decent amount which will then be trapped in the hat and then make the hat smell. It takes a while to dry. I found with prolonged use that my ears felt a little sore.Pros: Warm hat for cold weather fully covers ears with double layer fully adjustable works with headphones (not earbuds)Cons: Retains moisture could put pressure on ears which can cause soreness does not work with earbuds takes a while to dry not a great hat for weather above 45FI love this hat it's wicked comfortable to wear in the cold and makes life easier.,0

He's an older gentleman with a large tummy but no butt to speak of (where did it go?!).  With other jeans the manufacturers seem to think if you have a large waist you must also have a big butt.  So you end up with jeans that fit at the waist but with enough extra fabric at the hips so make a sail.  Seriously they flap in the wind.  These Lee jeans fit his waist and his hips with no extra fabric.He also likes that there is just the right number of belt loops.  If there aren't enough loops or if they aren't spaced correctly the belt slides up and rubs on bare skin.There was no shrinkage after washing in warm water and drying on medium heat.,0

February 27  2016By Ruger,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"With 60% of the USA population either at or quickly approaching overweight status it seems like most of the clothes makers decided to change their sizing patterns/forms to accommodate them.  While that may make the manufactures rich and a lot of customers happy it makes it very difficult for a person of normal weight and size/shape to find jeans that fit properly.  It seems like all the jeans made these days are made for people with large thighs and/or butts of which I am not blessed with neither.  So every time I purchase a set of jeans they made me look malnourished and fit very oddly.  Some even look like they are riding pants because the thighs stick out on the sides like balloons.  I was about to give up looking for normal fitting jeans but decided to try one more brand and see if that made a difference and it did.  I came across these regular fit straight legs jeans made by Lee and tried them on.  Low and behold they actually fit like the jeans I used to wear when I was younger.  No saggy butt no balloon thighs and NO malnourished look!!!!  Wow I am very pleased and my wife is as well.  She says I don't look like an old man wearing ""hand me down"" jeans from a larger person any more.  FINALLY jeans that fit.  I was so pleased I purchased several more pairs because you never know when/if Lee will change their sizing patterns/forms.  Thank you LEE for making me feel like part of the population again.

Jeans that look & feel good right away (none of that ""breaking in"" stuff) and they keep getting better over time as you wear them. Nothing flashy -- just well-made practical jeans that look good and last forever. Well not quite forever.Like threadbare PJ's or a favorite teddy bear those old Lee jeans finally retire making way for new comfortable ones. Studies have shown that this process -- outgrowing and casting off a beloved pair of jeans then buying a new pair just like the old -- can inspire sudden urges to go get a haircut or jump into a playful litter of bouncing puppies. There's nothing quite like a new pair of blue-jeans to remind us about relaxing and feeling good in our bodies.",0

My brother has been using these as his go-to jeans when going to school (alternating them with his Wranglers). The 30L is just perfect for someone who is within 5'7"" - 5'8""—there's just some wee left over to cover the shoes but not much that they touch the ground. They also don't look baggy. One might think that at first glance when they are out of the bag that they are going to be hip-hop baggy—but no! They are in the smaller side though waist-wise. Case in point 28Wx30L in Wrangler fits my brother well—though he uses a belt with them. With these jeans the waistline is a wee bit on the ""just right""—too tight if one's just had their meal. I recommend if one is on the mid-sizing i.e. with some 0.5 in the measurements go a size higher—it is easier to keep the jeans in place with a belt than have a product returned.Overall they are great and I bought several of these!",0

He purchased a khaki pair several months ago and liked them so much that he wanted a black pair.Pros:They are a good fit and comfortable to wear. He can wear them to church a business meeting or out to dinner. They look nice with a sweater or with a dress shirt and sport coat. The material is thicker than most dress type of pants. They do well with not wrinkling. If I remove them straight from the dryer they do not require any ironing.Cons:The black pants do seem to attract lint I have to make sure to wash them only with dark colors. This helps to cut down on the lint. I have also found that a lint brush is helpful and the lint does come off easily. I believe it's the material these are made from. As long as you are careful what you wash them with it's not a huge issue.Conclusion:Overall we are pleased with these and would purchase them again.,1

The very first day I wore them (this is not an exaggeration) both of the cuffs frayed. In edition to the cuff this is the worst material weeve you could possibly have for black it's a rough texture and they are a lint magnets. No joke if there is a piece of lint floating 30ft from your position these pants call the lint over for a pants party. The weeve is also heavy and kind of cheap feeling (like burlap).The Positive.... They fit well and you don't have to iron them.Final thought I have owned Haggar before and I've never had any issues with them the quality of these make me feel like they are a cheep knock off.

If you go out for a big lunch you will love the concept.  Plus the pants always feel perfect after putting them on as they will either contract a little or expand a little throughout the day as needed.Quality is good.  I wear these pants every day at work.  I use to wear Dockers until I found these.  I prefer the appearance compared to the Dockers as well as the fact that they have a button instead of metal clip to hold them closed in addition to the expandable waist for a perfect fit and appearance every time.Comfortable material and durable.  I usually but an assortment of these every fall and wear them daily at work.  I hesitate to make them sound too good as I don't want the prices to go up.,0

April 21  2015By AQ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The work to weekend pants from Haggar are my favorite work and casual dress pants that aren't blue jeans. They are comfortable and can be dressed up or down. The fabric is thick and good quality there is no sheen to the color which is great for business attire. If you live near a Haggar outlet check it out these pants usually sell for $29 there and you can save yourself some money. The Cool 18 pants are nice too if you are on a budget the fabric is thinner and great for summer time when you cannot wear shorts the fabric does have a sheen to it but it's not too bad I have a couple pairs I wear to work on those 100+ degree days here in the south. The Cool 18 pants can be had at the Haggar outlet for $19 which would save you a good amount of money compared to the work to weekend pants if you are on a tight budget.,0

I am an Engineer and I work in a plant environment. These are great b/c the look good and they hold up well and are durable and are super comfortable. I like the non-pleated pants better myself.The only issue I have had is finding the colors I want in my size. I have purchased the Navy Blue in store at JC Penny had to get the Khaki color from Sears and also from Amazon and the Bark color I got on amazon. I have not been able to find the Ocean color in stock anywhere which is something I would like to get and is the only color I haven't found at this point.They also come in several other styles that include pleats or the non pleated pant like this one. They also offer this in a denim style and there is a polyester blended one called the Cool 18 and they make that in all the same configurations. I am reluctant to try the Cool 18 polyester pants since they feel somewhat flimsy in the store. I am really not sure if they are worth trying or not if you want to find something for the hot weather. I might try a pair this summer.,0

November 9  2014By Keith H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Good day! I hope this review can help at least one person decide whether or not to try these. I'm not sure if it's due to the comfort waist feature but I would say these pants run on the large size. If Amazon still has free returns you may want to order a couple of sizes to be sure you get the best fit. These pants are ready to go right out of the dryer. No they don't have a razor sharp crease but they look perfectly acceptable for the office or weekend. I wear them to work all the time without ironing and they look just fine. If you are particular about having a crease you may want to touch them up with the iron. The comfort waist is a definite plus when you are between size or just had that extra large client lunch. The color is right on and the description is perfectly accurate. A side note I always have to have my slacks hemmed as I am very short. I just ordered these in a 30"" inseam and brought them to the tailor to shorten without incident and they look like they came that way. I would recommend these to any man in the market for new slacks - father son brother friend etc. I am almost positive they would like the pants and I'd bet they don't go back to regular waist pants after trying the comfort waist. Just one person's opinion your mileage may vary. Enjoy your new pants!",0

Regardless it is only a minor complaint that I had to pay $10 per pair to have them fit as perfectly as previous pairs... but still I had to pay $10 for the same model and style same measurements and same ID number for pants that I never previously had a problem with.These pants are excellent for people don't want to dress in pedestrian and plebeian bleu jeans but dont want to appear pompous and conceited as they would with more professional looking slacks. A perfect blend of classy functional sophistication and comfortable.,0

Uniforms Work & Safety,B002G9U8VE,Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey…,        44 of 48 people found the following review helpful       Much poorer quality fabric than they used to be and I can prove it!  February 16  2016By Resist!,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am very disappointed with this shirt and am returning it without even bothering to try it on.I own this exact shirt in this exact color that I have owned for several years.  My older shirt is made of much heavier fabric than the new one I received today.I read a number of other negative reviews here that mention the Haiti manufacturing facility as being the source of the poorly made shirts and low quality fabric.  From what I learned today about the Ash color XL Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt I have to agree.I purchased two of these shirts.  One Ash and one Black.  Both are inferior to the Ash colored XL that I currently own. I'll list the facts which confirm to me the poorer quality of the fabric in the new version.My original Ash colored shirt- Made in Honduras | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 424gm/15ozNew Black colored shirt- Made in Guatemala | 100% cotton | Weighs 402gm/14.2oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.New Ash colored shirt- Made in Haiti | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 384gm/13.5oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.The fabric on the Ash/Haiti version was very coarse to the touch and practically see through when held up toward a light across the room and is immediately noticeably thin.The fabric on the Black/Guatemala version was ok but not great and I hope it softens up in the wash.  It blocked a fair amount of the light when held up but was still noticeably thinner than my older shirt.My Ash/Honduras version is obviously softer after years of washing but blocks most of the light when held up and feels thick and substantial.I am returning the Ash/Haiti version because it is such poor quality and had it been my first ever Carhartt shirt I would assume that the brand was over-hyped and made crappy workwear.I will keep the Black/Guatemala version and wear it around for a while before deciding whether or not to keep it or send it back. Regardless both of these shirts were a big let down and the quality is not what they used to be.Both of the newer shirts ran larger than sized and even with all that additional fabric as compared to my other shirt still weighed in at 1-1.5 ounces lighter even including all the cardboard tags and stickers.FYI: After many many years buying from Amazon this is the first review I've ever written. That should tell you something about how negatively I view this product; Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt.,0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B002G9U8VE,Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       Carhartt joins all the rest in reducing quality and hoping we don't notice  December 8  2016By TCL,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"As others have mentioned in reviews quality at Carhartt at least for these t-shirts is all over the place depending somewhat on the color chosen (which in turn seems to come from various countries of manafacture).  I have some of these shirts purchased a little over a year ago that are heavy weight and fit the way I think they should with just the right amount of untucked length--not too short not too long-but I continue to be disappointed in the way the newer shirts fit and the quality thereof.I buy XL shirts and wear these constantly for work and outside of work.  I hate the fit of many of the newer ones that I've bought:  the shirts are far too long--much longer than the first ones I bought a year or so ago--and this is annoying for leaving them untucked.  Who wants a shirt hanging past your jean pockets?  Maybe you do but I don't and the point isn't the length as much as the fact that it's not the same as it used to be.  Too long.  My original shirts are just the right length and I expect the size and length of subsequent purchases to be the same (why should it be different; yet it is).And the quality and ""hand"" of the material used to make the shirt has changed and also varies depending on where that particular shirt was manufactured (could be Mexico or various places in the far east or Indonesia etc).I look to Carhartt for solid quality and heavy workwear.  It's extremely disappointing to find that they like seemingly all garment manufacturers keep reducing the quality of the products and hoping we don't notice--or perhaps they know we're stuck because every other shirt manufacturer is even worse.  I hate thin cotton t-shirts and other than Carhartt I don't know where to turn but if I could find something else I'd buy it in a heartbeat.Note:  this applies to the long sleeves specifically but some of the short sleeve versions of this shirt that I also buy and wear are even worse in terms of excess gangster-type shirt length and thin cheap-feeling material.Carhartt:  pick up your game!!  We notice the diminishing quality and aren't going to accept it much longer.  There must be an alternative and when I find it I'll be all done with Carhartt.  Sorry but it's your fault.",0

The fabric  is a medium weight and the stitching is well fabricated. As many others have stated it fits larger than the norm in sizing. I personally like tees that have a little extra room so the sizing is not a problem for me. It has extra length which for me is great. I want a tee to stay tucked in and this one certainly does that. Though it runs large the neck sizing fits comfortably without being baggy. Sleeve length is on the long side but like the collar the cuffs fits snug without  being binding. I ordered the forest green and the color was spot on with the advertised color. One thing that is a downside for me though is where it is manufactured. I always prefer my purchase to be made in the USA but clothing seldom is. This tee was manufactured in Honduras.,0

Amazon made the returning/refunding process very smooth and expedient.I love the random yellow accents with the loops to hang stuff off of and the multitude of large and small pockets all over the place. There are also yellow mesh pockets here and there that are nice for jewelry to stay snug within. The pocket on the right upper thigh side has a nice big pocket for a large cell phone like I have.

The loose fit double knee with multi use pocket and fat belt loops. I am finally retiring a pair that I have had for 10 years In fact Im not even retiring them I'm just not wearing them in public any more due to all the holes and tears. I haven't changed pant size since high school so I can literally wear clothes down to the threads. Plus I'm a cheap skate and don't like to spend money on clothes.These aren't like other Dickies. Like the ones you find at stores like say Wal-Mart. They may be labeled the same but they aren't. That's not to say you can't buy these at stores just be careful. There are cheap versions of these that are labeled the same but in fact are of a much lower quality. These pants are thicker heavier duty more comfortable better fit and longer lasting. You can tell the difference easily if you look. These pants have a wider belt loop than the cheap ones These feel a bit thicker and they say ""loose fit"" on the inside of the waist band.For me the fit is as expected. Of course I've been wearing these so long I don't need to try them on before buying. They are relaxed fit. If you normally wear say a 31"" waist regular this will be loose and will require a belt (or sagging - to each his own). They are not so baggy to be obnoxious. They are the prefect ""looseness"". Also the bottom of the legs is not like other Dickies or other pants generally speaking. They really don't taper at all so they cover the shoe nicely. I wear a 10.5 shoe and with bare feet I can bend my toes up and fit my foot inside the bottom of the pant leg (straight across). I like this feature because I can wear my work boots and have the pant legs cover up most of the boot keeping them cleaner.The pants really hold up well even in working environments wearing them every day. They hold up to just about everything except fire. Fire will put holes in them quickly. Chemicals and stains are for the most part no match for these pants. They will stain of course with the right substance and without proper washing techniques. No big deal to be expected. Fabric softener will drastically reduce the life of your pants. I don't use it for this reason. i like my Dickies a ""little stiff"". They come stiff as a board but after one wash they are good for me.I guess that's it. Great long lasting pants that look and fit better than any other...in my opinion.",1

I finally ended up buying a pair of these pants and it was a 50 50 split. I like the pants they are very durable and they look professional. On the other hand they did not fit as well as I hoped. I have not been to a store to buy pants for quite sometime but I normally get 30-32. I ordered 31-32 just to be safe because i am picky on how cloths fit me. There is nothing worse than wearing pants that squeeze at your waist all day long. Anyways I got the pants in the mail (a day later than it said but that's no biggie) and I tried them on. The length was good and the fit around the legs and all was good but the waist was a bit too tight. I mean its not like I have gained that much weight sense I last bought pants!

According to the description above that was the fabric. I detest polyester. However what arrived was in fact 65% polyester and only 35% cotton. I was forced to return it for a refund since neither the automated return function nor actual real human customer service reps were able or willing to address the basic issue of either sending an all cotton version as a replacement or determining whether such as thing even exists. Typical Amazonian support nightmare dance of mis-direction and really well-educated non-native English speakers not understanding a simple issue.  As it turns out a search of the Dickies site turns up no all-cotton garments except for the carpenter pants. Amazon certainly wasted a lot of my time and energy for absolutely nothing.That said I should warn other potential buyers of the actual polyester/cotton pant that it is so undersized that it comes close to being fraud. I wear a 32-34"" waist depending. The pants I received were allegedly 34"" but had to be at least 2 inches too small. I'd have needed to lose a dangerous amount of weight to get them to fit. If you've never purchased Dickies before ( as was true for me) I'd recommend trying on the pants at Walmart or some place similar before ordering them from Amazon.",0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B003RRYAN6,Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double-Knee Work…, Fantastic Quality for the Price!  May 23  2016By Jared ThorntonVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have a service job and it has me on my knees a lot which as consequence leaves me with sore knees and worn fabric! I have been through so many pairs of pants in my line of work and well I'm tired of it to be completely honest. I purchased a pair of these pants two years ago and they have weathered the storm that is my occupational hazards in champion compared to other pants of this price point. The double knee lining adds the extra comfort I had desired for so long and finally in triumph stands up to the ill-mannered intent of the unnecessarily treacherous depths my career regularly entails. These pants are the definition of comfort in darkness of the endless rotation of 10-hour shifts that punctuate my time on this earth. The convenience the cellphone pocket brings to my daily routine cannot be qualified in words alone perhaps it should be best expressed as a color which I would be inclined to say--in opinion of course--is a green hue polka dotted with a translucent purple. In all honesty I wake up excited to wear these pants to have them support me and to have the validation and confidence boost that comes with knowing that I am the only thing holding these testaments of human ingenuity erect. These pants are my partner; they have my legs (quite literally!) and I have theirs.To anyone questioning these pants I insist you should have no doubt; these are the pants you are looking for.,0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B003RRYAN6,Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double-Knee Work…,        1 of 1 people found the following review helpful       Finally found a work pant that works with me.  July 17  2016By D and K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I repair appliances and spend much of my time on my knees.  Our company provided uniform pants tended to rip at the crotch so I've been looking around for a better pant. These have survived longer than any pair I've used with no obvious loosening of the seams or other unwanted changes. The color is near perfect.I do wish that they had a opening or vent to insert pads into the double knees. However there is a solution since they have double knees. I cut a small horizontal slit in the inner layer of knee material near the top and was able to slip a rolled up square of neoprene between the layers then unroll it. So far this has worked great and allows me to remove the pad when worn out.,0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B003RRYAN6,Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double-Knee Work…, Order 1 size up for relaxed/loose. 2 sizes up for regular  August 23  2016By R McKennaVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Awesome work pants my did come with that new car smell (I know very weird but it was definitely what it smelled like).So huge confusion on the size. I went to the local Wally world and i tried the three sizes available. Im not a fan of buying and returning so I took the guessing work out of it. Here is what worked for me at least. Relaxed/ loose fit order a size up. I am normally a 40 everywhere but 42 fit like a normal 40. The 874 or regular fit I had to go 2 sizes up. I could get a size up around my waist but way to tight on the hips and butt region. Lastly I tried the slim fit.... just didn't work at all for me. I wasn't made for slim/skinny. I also couldn't even find a 40/42/44 in stores. I tried a 38 on fully expecting they would be to small and they were about 4 inches from even clasping. So I assume maybe 2 sizes up also on them.The pants IMO should be washed before wearing. They are rigid. After a few washes they got alot more comfortable.,0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B003RRYAN6,Dickies Men's Loose Fit Double-Knee Work…, Good Fit  Durable Build  Weak Belt Loops  October 7  2016By JOBYVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love these pants! They fit perfectly. The bottoms are a little bit more bell than I would like but overall they fit great. When I'm standing you can't see the laces on my boots. The side pocket on the right leg is far enough above the right knee to put your cell phone in. And not just any cell phone; I put a 5.7 inch cell phone in the pocket and it slid in smoothly. It was also no trouble to get it out. The front pockets are of ample size and nicely positioned. They also rest nice and flat when your standing upright.  The only complaints I can muster are the belt loops barely fit an inch and a half belt there are two Dickies labels stitched to the outside; one on the cell pocket and one on the left knee (I don't advertise for free) and there is some pilling on the front of the thighs after a few wears.  I'd recommend these to a friend and I will buy these again soon.,0

For starters the material has begun to create this fraying little balls making them look super old and unprofessional.The colors are also not true to the image what was supposed to be wine is more like a magenta or almost hot pink.The top fits loosely at the waist area giving it a frumpy look and the bottoms bubble up at the belly area because they're so loose they make you look like you have a mommy pouch.Honestly I've gotten better products at Walmart for a similar price.Two stars for price and the fact that they're comfortable to wear.,0

The material is good not see-through or too thick and rather soft for scrubs. I ordered an xs this time since the last order was a bit but. They fit nicely but the pants are still a bit too long on me. The elastic is snug and they have a drawstring to tighten them a bit if necessary. I also have to roll them over once to keep me from walking on them. The shirt fits nicely as well a little big on me for an xs but it's expected.

I am 5'9 and 170 lbs and there is no way this should have been big on me. Everyone knows that you usually go with a smaller size when ordering scrubs especially bottoms. The bigger problem I had with these scrubs are that they are way too long. With the hem bottoms dragging on the ground and the bottoms falling down I look quite thug while wearing these lol. I have always ordered tall but never have they been this long. The quality is still there it just doesn't fit me right and I ordered the same size and length that I have ordered in the past.

Help us all out. Pants online are hard to fit!This review is for Lee relaxed fit flexible comfort waistband ""(sits) at the waist"". Size ""6Short"". 98%cotton. 2%spandex. RN 130273.The RN is the topmost number on the inner tag which identifies this specific cut.  Other numbers on the inner tag designate size and color differences for this RN.First part of review does NOT apply to NOMAD. See end of this review for NOMAD.The ""Authentic Dark"" has a barely detectable undertone of white or lighter blue. It is virtually solid blue-black. It is marked ""made in Mexico "" and is 98% cotton and 2% spandex.The ""Authentic Nordic"" is a nice dark blue-lighter than the ""Auth Dark"" but still a dressy dark.  Also ""Authentic Nordic"" has that traditional white undertone-contrast.  HOWEVER what is not apparent in the online ad for the Nordic is that the fronts of the thighs are sandblasted lighter. Totally ruins the dressy look. Authentic Nordic is marked ""made in Mexico of US fabric"". Also 98%cotton 2% spandex.Both Nordic 6S and Dark 6S have a 30 inch inseam as do all of my prior RN 130273's.Rise on all my colors : 10.5 from ""crotch Seam joint"" to top of front waistband. Hits me below belly button.Rise from ""crotch seam joint"" up to the BACK of the waistband is 15"".So the back of the pant has room for ""booty round out"" and puts the back waistband a bit higher (1"" or so) than the front. The waistband does not gap-even without a belt. A blessing for me!ME:I am 5'4"" and weigh 144lbs.I have the ""hourglass shape"".My waist just below belly button where waistband hits is 31"".My hipbone circumference is 37"".My ""biggest booty around"" is 41.5.My max thigh is 21"".My Leg Inseam is 29"". (I buy 30""inseam)I have the RN 130273 in 4 other colors and all ft me fabulous and have the 30"" inseam.JEANS:On the jeans: (measured laying ""flat x 2"" and does not take any ""stretch"" into account.)The calf width on the 6S is 15.5 inches.The bottom leg opening on this pant is 15.5"".There is a traditional 1/2 inch 3-layer sewn hem. Not an ""inch wide"" like some other styles.The max thigh width on the 6S is 22 inches.Waistband is 30"" but there is about 1-1.5"" of available stretch. I measure 31"" where the waistband hits.30"" waistband (and other pant measurements) calculated by laying the pants flat and measuring from side seam to side seam then ""times two...15x2=30"".So the 6S  fits me perfectly. Nice curve skimming but not ""tight-glued-SNUG"".  No sausage looks  and not too loose at end of the day.  Some pants with spandex are a baggy mess at the end of the day. I have not found that with this style/cut/brand.There is no room for letting this pant out.5 belt loops. Button waist with zipper. 5 pockets. Back pockets are external patch pockets. They sit high enough to not be on the biggest bum area.Front pockets are traditional curve-not those straight ""slash"" pockets. All pockets are usable not just for decoration"".I wash all jeans/pants inside out in cold gentle and line dry.Since I do not use a heated dryer for jeans (or anything else but towels) I don't know if there is any heat shrinkage. I have not noticed any shrinkage with line drying.During the First wash I ""fix"" the colors by adding two cups of vinegar. Google it. It works.NOMAD: Grrrrr ZERO STARSVery disappointed in ""Nomad"" . Tight and way short -back they go.NOMAD marked made in Indonesia. Same RN 130273 but fit and size are  very different.Flat waist is 28"".Inseam only 27.5 (if that)!Very uncomfortably skintight and very very short.  Even after wearing a while there wouldn't be enough ""relax"" with the spandex that they will ever be comfortable.Tag style is also noticeably different (see photos) for the inside tag and the paper sales tags.The NOMAD is marked ""made in Indonesia""98%cotton 2% spandex.Only color (to date) marked ""Indonesia""All others ""made in Mexico""Ok new color received. Premium Dark. Different fabric like a stretch pant-not like a Jean! Fabric is 70% cotton 29%polyester and 1%spandex. The color is more towards ""sky"" blue. Brighter and more vibrant.Waist and thighs in the Premium Dark color are more snug. Uncomfortably so and hello muffin tops. Back they go.So two colors fitting like ""in-store"" purchases and for me norm to date are theAuthentic Nordic and Authentic Dark. I ordered Authentic Nike and hope it is same color as ""Authentic Nordic"" but without sandblasted thigh fronts.I added a photo with the leg of the ""premium Dark"" across the ""Authentic Nordic-middle with lighter thigh area peeking through"" and ""Authentic Dark"" the Blue-Black color on far right",1

November 19  2015By FallingLeaves,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Meh these are not at all the same as they used to be.  I should've listened to the other reviews.  They are too big around the waist and as I wear them the waist stretches more and more and after a few hours they are way too big on me.  If I was wearing these to work or on a date I'd be miserable.  The only reason I'm not returning them is I'm in desperate need of a pair of jeans.  They fit me in the hips but not in the waist.  That's nothing new but for them to keep stretching out as the day/night goes on is NOT good.They also attract A LOT of lint or pet hair!  So be warned.....if you are just going to a restaurant you're probably fine.  If you are going somewhere where there are pets or they let their pets on the furniture......forget it!! OR bring a pet lint roller with you cause you are going to need it....guaranteed!  I purchased the black and I have a white dog.  My other jeans do not attract pet hair at all so it's never been an issue regardless of the color of jeans. These have spandex in them so they attract it like the plague.  My last pair had spandex as well but only 1%.  Who knew that one more percent was going to ruin these jeans so badly.  Not bad to have the extra bit of stretchiness in the legs and hips but it is a nightmare to have in the waist.  I actually should've purchased another size down because of this.These are also too long in the legs.  The last 2-3 inches fit right under my feet if I am wearing flip flops.  Inevitably I end up walking  directly on the jeans inside of my flip flops! Annoying!  I am 5'3"" and my other Lee Original jeans are a 15R or 16R ....it's faded so it's hard to read and they fit me perfectly.  I just wish I could buy them again but I can't find them anywhere.I am 35"" in the waist and 45"" in the hips. If this is your measurements go down one size.  They might be a tad tighter in the hips but they stretch and they will fit a lot better in the waist.  HOWEVER I still don't recommend them as the whole lint thing is extremely annoying!Edited to update 1/31/16:I HATE THESE JEANS!  The whole attracting pet hair has made these just literally impossible to wear.  I can't touch my dog he can't get near me or they get his hair all over me. These are a magnet for pet hair.  I had no idea how much I had on me til my brother started laughing uncontrollably and finally got it out that I had more hair on my rear than our dog has!!!  AWFUL! I wish I had returned them because I can't wear them anywhere.  :(*These jeans were a regular purchase not promotional. They might have been on sale at the time. I paid $26.35 plus tax.",0

February 14  2015By GB,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Lee has always been my go-to brand for jeans and pants but Lee has gotten very sloppy in their manufacturing -  I keep getting pants and jeans with one twisted leg or one side of the jeans smaller than the other zipper that points up to my left shoulder instead of being midline and huge inconsistency in sizing.  I just ordered 2 pair of jeans in size 6 short 1 pair Olive and 1 pair in Black.  The black jeans fit as expected with plenty of room and slightly long but no need to hem.  The olive jeans were way too tight shorter in leg length than petite jeans (would be way too short if I washed them) and the entire left side of the jeans including leg and even derriere was noticeably smaller than the right side.  As others have mentioned I sure do wish I could get these jeans in true denim instead of the stretchy garbage now being used.  What the heck Lee?  Very shoddy workmanship.,0

I am short and wide and I liked the way that the jeans were cut curvy.  However when the Lee jeans found in stores dropped in cotton content I stopped buying them.These jeans with 98% cotton had my hopes up.  However this fabric is definitely stretchier and does not offer support for those of us who don't want to show every jiggle.  I am not looking for a control panel but I don't want to feel like I'm baring everything in lycra tights either.The cut is not the same either.  These feel as if they are cut straighter (more of a man's fit?).  The jeans are a bit tighter in the upper thigh and do not curve inwards as much at the waist.  Also the waist is higher... I purchased a ""short"" size and still might need to fold the waist band over.  I would have tried exchanging for a size lower if there had been more room in the thigh of this pair.So why two stars rather than one?  I do approve of the higher cotton content and hope Lee jeans goes back up to 99% or even 100%.  Also while the pants do not fit well the fit is a tad better than the lower cotton content Lee's that I tried at the local stores.",0

Straight Leg Jeans for years and they have been wonderful and fit me perfectly  May 13  2016By Teri T,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have bought these Lee Women's Relaxed Fit Straight Leg Jeans for years and they have been wonderful and fit me perfectly.  In my most recent purchase I bought two pairs but each a different color.  What I discovered is that the cut of the jeans have changed drastically!  The darker pair of jeans fit as all my other purchased jeans fit but the lighter pair (Azur) fit awful!  The new cut dips down significantly in the back/butt and so literally will not stay up in the back and are embarrassingly almost showing my butt!  The waist used to fit high up at the natural waist in the back and the front but no longer!  The labeling on both pairs was identical the only difference was the color but in actuality these two pairs were not anything alike and fit totally different.  Why is Lee altering a classic fit that has been in production for YEARS and selling this new cut/style as if they are the old style?  This new fit is terrible.  Oh and don't even get me started on the difference of the stretchy fabric Lee is now using!  So disappointed!,0

August 1  2016By ckmw,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"i just got my first pair of danskos today and i couldnt be happier! i've been on a quest to find the perfect work shoe that has a little height to it and with this purchase i'm pretty sure it has officially come to an end. they are terrifically comfy and i cant wait to try them out.as far as the sizing i'll share my situation just in case it might help anyone else out...i have very very odd feet. they're a bit on the wider side but i have such freakishly high arches that my shoe size (depending on the shoe) varies between 7.5 and 9.so when i saw the sizing options offered between 7.5 and 9 it was same old same old in terms of me being conflicted on what size to buy. especially after reading that these shoes ""stretch out"" or ""loosen up"" after being broken in.if a shoe is leather or will give and is offered in standard sizes I usually order a size 8 and if it's snug a few days of wearing them around with heavy layered socks seems to make them the perfect fit (i've even gone so far as to walk on my treadmill with 3 pairs of socks on to break a pair in...a bit nutty i know but it's what works!)when i ordered these it was after both reading tons of existing reviews and going through the questions/answers.honestly if these shoes were just for fashion i probably wouldve gone with the size 38 because any cute shoe should fit flush/snug. but keeping in mind that i'm on my feet all day (swelling etc) that it's cold most of the year and i'll be wearing much more substantial socks than the dippy little dollar-store throwaway ones i sport in the warmer months...i opted for the size 39.my foot slipped right in and they do clunk a bit when i walk but i absolutely made the right choice erring on the larger size for these shoes. i'd rather have a bit of give to accomodate warm socks (and the arch supports/inserts that inevitably find their way into any shoe i wear longer than once every few months) than have to worry about negotiating more room by stretching them out.so if you're around an 8 and dont know whether to go with 38 or 39 and you need these for being on your feet all day just in my personal opinion i'd say opt for the 39.also i ordered the black sparkle color and i was afraid they might look a bit more charcoal-y because of the glittery look but the color is definitely glossy black at first sight. just sparkly too. overall excellent buy!",1

So it was a delightful surprise to find a pair for $80 on Amazon.I read the reviews here and decided to order a size up as many said they run small and wore them the very next day.I am very happy to report that even brand new they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I also recommend getting a size bigger than your normal shoe size. If I had bought the shoe size I normally wear they would have been too tight on top.I hope this helps new buyers in your decision to try Dansko clogs.,0

November 27  2016By Tasha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I held off on writing this because I did have to exchange for a bigger pair. I checked the size of all of my shoes and the EU size was 40 so that's what I originally ordered but they were ridiculously small. I exchanged for a 41 and they fit perfectly. The suggested fit was 41 but because all my shoes are 40 I felt more comfortable ordering that but should have went with the suggested size. I am a constant size 10 if that helps anyone with bigger feet. I went through the reviews and none really stated a size that big and how they fit. I have had to buy one pair of 9.5 shoes and one pair of 10.5 other than that always size 10. I couldn't be happier with how the exchange went either. The new pair shipped the day after I requested an exchange. I had bought these at the $35 price and the price went up to $80 after I ordered them but I wasn't charged extra. I ordered Black Marbled Patent and they look even better in person. I am having to wear them with hoses instead of socks because the top is kind of tight and my sock doesn't slip into the shoe and it will scrunch my toes up because of the sock. I am hoping that will get better but if not it's not a major concern for me. I should also say that I have a HIGH instep. When I walk in water and step on concrete the print of the side of my feet are about in inch maybe less so that could be why the top is a little more tighter on me than normal.I do feel like they change the way I walk and stand for the better and I love the added height even if it isn't a lot. Anyways I recommend them!,0

I have size 7 wide feet with high arches and purchased the size 38 EU/7.5-8 M US. These shoes support my arches and fit very well. My only fit issue is the outer ball of my foot on one foot. One show also has an extra 1/4 inch if trim hanging past where it should be tucked in. Not noticeable on a dark shoe I may try to cut it off.  If my feelings about these shoes change I will update this post.I tried a pair of Sanita in a size 39  and they were not for me. The shoe length is a little too long while the arch was where it should be based on the heel of my foot.  The top of the shoe the part that arches over the top of the foot was too tight and would have rubbed me raw. I couldn't go up a size because the shoes were already too long and going down a size would have strangled my feet even more. Sanita brand seem to be better for people with narrow long feet.** Update several weeks later **I've upped the stars to five!  The leather stretched so that little tight spot is gone. No slipping on wet floors. No blisters or pinch spots at all!  Looks great and are very cushioning for a long day. The arch support helps keep my knees and feet happy too. Really worth the money!  Before purchasing be sure to really read other reviews about how they're supposed to fit. The heel does not cling to the foot your heel is supposed to float and move in the shoe as you walk. Something for this sneaker wearer to get used to.,0

I was pretty hesitant to buy these I will admit. They look clunky and heavy in the pictures and they look this way in real life too. But I highly recommend giving them a try! Despite being on my feet all day at work (and often longer due to going out to shop/run errands after work) my feet are rarely sore. I love that they are stain resistant and they are sort of smooth on the bottom (not slippery though) so that I can swivel around without actually having to lift my feet if that makes sense. They have been pretty durable so far I've used them every day at work for 7 months and they have minimal signs of wear and no signs of falling apart anytime soon. Added bonus: no shoe strings that keep coming untied! Love them.,0

I am top heavy and disproportionate for a female. Meaning I've always had to go with a size large for tops and sometimes a medium for bottoms. Normally sized at a large when it comes to nurses uniforms to play it safe. So I will agree with what has been said about going one size smaller on these as these run larger particularly the bottoms.Perhaps because they are meant to be unisex. I found that size medium did it for me. I will have to hem the pants to size but this is not an issue. I do not expect these to last as they are not made out of tough gabardine or heavy cotton or polyester blend but they make a decent alternative pair to replace some of my outgrown pairs or those that have been worn to the nubs. For the price they are OK. I will update how they wash out and wear down.,0

I wear a size XXL and the fit is perfect not tight not baggy. I am glad that after reading a few reviews  I did not order a size down. From reading the reviews it appears that the smaller women have the issue of the sizes running large but the plus-size women find the sizes to be true to usual fit. And this is what I have confirmed with my own plus-size purchase. The fabric is only a little stiff but I find the stiffness keeps the look more professional. I washed before wearing and the scrubs held up nicely colors not fading. I like the elastic in the back of the pants to supplement the drawstring in the front. Nice purchase for the money.

I'm an avid Asic's girl. I run/jog/walk a lot and I only wear Asic's. I was really excited to get these they are super cute and I love the elastic laces they come with. BUT they are like walking around on bricks. My first run in them the bottoms of my feet hurt. I thought surely they'd soften up but no such luck a month later and constant daily torture and they still suck in the comfort department. I get lots of compliments on their looks and I agree super hot!! So for that 2 stars. Otherwise I'd burn these stupid things. Not a happy runner. Also I agree they do run small but more on the width side not length they are more narrow than other Asic's I've worn.,0

By luck I found these and they are exactly the same without the cord design and I am thrilled.  They are light and comfortable perfect fit at the waist thank god  so you don't have to pull them up all night long they have flair legs which always make your legs look better and they are he perfect length which has always been an issue with scrub pants for me..either an inch to short or the talls are way too long.  I'm 5'8 and 149 lbs and the medium are perfect.  Now if I can find these with cargo pockets on the legs I'll be even happier.  I can't wear scrub pants that are low rise or just draw string  these are elastic back and part draw string.  Just perfect.  Now I can throw all my other pants out that I have to pull up all flipping night long...thank GOD.  These scrub pants are awesome!!!!! Yay Barco,0

July 29  2015By Wilma S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Slightly over sized but that is because this is a top that you need to be comfortable in for work/school. I typically wear a large but have been wearing a medium more recently. I bought three of these tops in a medium and they fit me perfectly. I was worried there would not be enough room in the chest area (I am a 36D and some mediums are too small) but this size is perfect. If you are unsure of sizing I would recommend trying tops on in store and ordering on line for a cheaper price. That is what I did.It is a scrub top therefore it is not extremely flattering but it does not look or feel like a potato sac. I love this color it looks great with brunette hair. Now that I know I like this top I will be ordering more.When reading reviews keep in mind that people always have something negative to say.I WOULD definitely recommend this product.,0

They fit true to size and have a flattering fit cinch slightly at the waist. The fabric is high quality and can by washed and dried without shrinking or loosing color. One more amazing quality is the wrinkle resistance - I have left these in the dryer unfolded overnight and able to pull them out and wear them without many wrinkles. As an Occupational Therapist I am very active and squatting/bending/running all the time and these scrubs have ""give"" but look structured and professional. Highly recommend.",0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B00IL3NSNY,Cherokee Workwear Scrubs Unisex Cargo Pant, Decent  July 7  2014By M. NguyenVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"5'8"" male.  I usually stay way from Landau because they fit me horribly.  This pants actually fit pretty decent.  I got the color navy.I'd rate it more like 3.5 starsPros:- I like the fabric.  The cotton/polyester blend makes it comfortable to wear but can clean up well too.  The stretchyness of it is awesome.  I don't feel constricted as all.  I can bend down and not worry about my pants ripping.  I feel quite comfortable.- The belt loops.  The pants have drawstrings too but they aren't great.- I got the medium size fit and I'd say it has a straight leg profile which I am very happy about.  The fit is much better than Laudau's unisex brands (more baggy).- Decent pockets.  They have the two hand pockets two back pockets and two cargo pockets.Cons:- No short version.  I had to cut 3 inches off the bottom to make it fit me.  I normally wear 29-30"" inseam pants.- The cargo pockets make me go WTF.  The left cargo pocket is on the anterior thigh.  It isn't comfortable to put flushes or my phone here.  I love putting my phone in the cargo pockets.  But since the pocket is on the front it makes walking awkward.  I would have preferred to to stick to the side of the leg.  I'd have to stick with carrying papers for this pocket and nothing heavier.  The right cargo pocket isn't any better.  It is small and the pocket opening is horizontal with an annoying velcro piece.  I normally carry flushes in my cargo pockets but I can't with these because of the way the opening is position.  I don't even know what I can use this pocket for.  The pocket opening makes it awkward to reach in and get stuff.  Even with the velcro I'd still be afraid of small items falling out.  The hand pockets are nice.  The opening is more vertical which makes it easy to grab stuff out of it.  The back left pocket is where my phone goes now.  The right pocket has the annoying velcro piece.- If you got something in your pockets (e.g. keys phone etc) and your skin rubs over the top of the pants it leaves skin scuff (more issue for dark colors).  Not a big deal but annoying if you want to look clean.- If you don't want to wear a belt they have a drawstring on the inner side of the pants.  It would have been nice if the drawstring was a little beefier.  I find that I still have to use a belt.Overall:My choices were limited due to my hospital requirements and there isn't many choices for men fit.  But at the end of the day it fits it's comfortable and it works.  I would say to give it a try.",0

April 3  2015By MGH,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,If you're concerned about fit and comfort more than price these are NOT the scrubs to buy.  The top fits slightly large around the bust and under the arms and snug around the abdomen and waist.  I tried two sizes the XL and the 2XL- the 2XL was way too big throughout the entire top and the XL provides too snug a fit for my comfort.  I want scrubs that provide a professional looking fit not baggy and sloppy.  While lightweight the material does not seem to breathe so if you're working in a warm building and doing  a lot of walking etc. you get hot fast.  I've washed the top 4 or 5 times and the material is still somewhat stiff.  Overall not a great product.,0

I really like the semi-silky material. They are very comfortable to wear all day. The only down fall about these is if you do not remove them from the dryer and fold right away they become very wrinkled! They also seem to collect pet hair if you have animals! I had no choice on color but the red is a very nice shade. I have had greys anatomy in the past and knew I needed a bigger size than previously but I believe they run pretty true to size.,0

Urbane is a great brand the material is strong but has a soft polished professional look.  I have the Bailey cargo pants that work perfectly with this top.  If you are a plus size like me than go with Urbane.  I like my clothes just a little loose but if you want a snug fit you may want to go down a size.  I will be buying this brand for a long time.,0

Nice fabric quality for price  September 21  2014By janascally,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I mainly choose WonderWink for my scrub pants and they do typically run small especially in the seat and maybe the thighs. These pants altho they are flare style are pretty form fitting and do not look wide at all. The material is comfortable but the stretch-factor isn't too noticeable. The pockets are flattering.My only issue is the inconsistency of sizing here compared to other Wonderwink styles. I ordered L-Petite but it fits me like a M in their other styles. I am normally a 8-10 pant size so that would qualify for M. However I tend to buy L-Petite so that I have enough room to bend over and not have my pants come down (as often happens to me with scrub pants). So it seems like I would need to order XL-Petite in this style order to not have the pants feel like they will slide down when bending down.,0

March 5  2016By Israel Garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"*UPDATED*I originally gave 2 stars. However I have now dropped it to 1 star. After sending back the first 2 I purchased because the sizing was WAY off I reordered even before being refunded. Now again I will be returning. This time just one of them but none the less it's a real inconvenience.1st. I ordered a navy and ash shirt. The navy color was as expected. The ash on the other hand was not ash it was very light heather grey. Tag shows ""Ash"" it is clearly heather.2nd. They are still big for being ""Small"" the navy shirt made in Honduras seems to be closest to the medium shirts I normally wear hopefully after a wash it shrinks.The ""Ash"" shirt seems like a large/extra large and again is heather grey made. This one made in Haiti. It's not the fit I wanted nor the color so I will be returning AGAIN.Overall my rating is based on experience as well as the fit and product description.*ORIGINAL POST*2 stars because the 2 I ordered were massive. I ordered medium size shirts and got medium size shirts according to the tag. All the shirts and even jackets I own are medium size. They were more like large maybe even XL in size. I returned them and ordered the small. Crossing my fingers that they fit otherwise returning them also. The hassle to return something and wait for a refund is the reason it got 2 stars. The quality seemed fine to me and the colors were true.",0

March 28  2016By ralph jackson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Have purchased and worn Carhartt Work Wear pocket ""T"" Shirts for a dozen years plus with great satisfaction however something has gone wrong with them. The fit is no longer correct the tight neck and smoothness is gone the fabric quality and thickness is also gone which used to be the best of any t shirt made. I now understand they are made in several different world wide locations but my last ones I bought were from 3 different countries and the difference in them was astounding nothing was the same they all lacked the ""old  Carhartt fit."" I left a negative review on Carhartt's website which was rejected however I did receive an email from Terrie in customer service asking me to call them and explain my situation. I spoke to them today 3/28/16 and explained to an Inga in customer service what I was experiencing and she tried to explain that the factories were required to make them exactly the same material fit and quality. I explained mine were not close to same and all were terrible. She apologized and was very nice and offered me a discount and free shipping if I would give them another chance and she explained that  Carhartt has run across situations where other on line stores were able to purchase ""seconds"" in vast quantities and sell them at a serious discount of course my first reply was couldn't Carhartt put a stop to that as it obviously was creating a very bad brand name issue for a once terrific product. She said they would love to do that but it's work in progress. I took her up on her offer and ordered 6ea 2Xl white pocket ""T's"" through her and we'll see what happens",0

The two I find work best for me are the Eddie Bauer Classic and this one. The fit is equally good on both but the Carhardt fabric is a bit heavier. In colder months or cooler climates (meaning just about anywhere but Phoenix) this isn't a problem. In the Phoenix summer? Problem.I don't really like the pocket but it's useful at times I guess. Gives Carhardt somewhere to put their logo which is still a bit of a status symbol while in certain company.Great durable shirt at a good price.

The ones I bought at Sears were manufactured in Haiti and exactly what I was looking for:  100% cotton NOT stretchy and of a relatively heavy weight.  Now after two years of heavy use and many washings these shirts are still wearable but beginning to look a bit worn.  So I purchased what I thought was the same shirt from Amazon--but when they arrived I was dismayed to discover that they seem to be a lighter weight.  Even worse although the tags claim that the shirts are 100% cotton they are slightly stretchy which leads me to believe they may contain perhaps 1-3% lycra.  The Amazon shirts were manufactured in Guatemala.  I want a heavier 100%-cotton t-shirt with no lycra and no stretchiness and will go back to shopping in-store for t-shirts so I can see what I'm getting before purchasing.,0

The body of the shirt is well made and wears well but the necks are so crappy that I amstarting to look at other brands to buy.  If I am going to throw a shirt away after only 6 months I might as well startbuying cheaper ones.It saddens me to have to write this negative review and until Carhartt goes back to making top quality products once again I'mafraid I am now an ex customer.,0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B002G9UDKU,Carhartt Men's Workwear Short Sleeve T-Shirt…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       My pick of work T-shirt after testing out several brands  August 24  2014By Tyler B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is the best shirt out of several brands of work shirts I have tried. I tried stocking up on Duluth Trading Long-Tail t-shirts because they had extra room called a 'tradesman fit' that's the opposite of a slim-fit shirt that and they are a few inches longer on the bottom to prevent plumber's crack. The problem I ran into price. Duluth Trading stuff is really nice I mean REALLY NICE but it's too expensive. From underwear to shirts to pants I love their stuff to death but I went broke just buying 2-3 days worth of clothing.So began my search for alternatives. For a few days I wrapped my mind around all normal shirts being too short for me. One I do not like plumbers crack and I bend down and kneel down a lot. Two I conceal carry. Long shirts do 80-90% of the concealment for you if you have one otherwise you have to dig a holster inside your pants and dig into your hip hard. Extra-tall sized shirts is a cheap alternative to the semi-custom size of the Duluth Longtail t-shirts. Next criteria I needed price. Well pretty much everything is cheaper than Duluth except maybe UnderArmour. But UnderArmour stuff is generally tight-fitting so they lose that competition. These are shirts I bought in Tall size to supplement my existing longer Longtail t-shirts:Fruit-of-the-Loom (FOTL) cotton t-shirt from Wal-Mart: Average fit around my body feels like advertized size. Thin material. Cost $8 in Wal-Mart cheap but it's not a quality shirt at all and doesn't compete with the rest. It's just a grade lower. It's a cheap shirt but I would still gladly wear this if I didn't have my other work-shirts.Hane's Beefy-T's 6.10z t-shirt: Cheap less than half price of Duluth. Material is too thin for me for a work-shirt. Yes even in summer I like thick material as it wicks more sweat away. The material was too thin for a work shirt same thickness as the FOTL shirt. Slightly trim fitting after break-in they are what I consider 'normal' for their advertised size slightly more trim than the FOTL. $10 with Prime.Dickie's Big-tall heavyweight crew neck short-sleeve: thicker than the Beefy-T but just barely. Same price as Beefy-T. Very trim fitting for advertised size I would consider these as a 'trim fit' for very lean individuals to be comfortable in. Even if I was in the same shape as I was at 21 these would still be tight fitting.Duluth Long-Tail t-shirt (did not order as tall ordered at normal height): Thick material comfortable in summer by wicking moisture better and comfortable in winter since it's thicker. Two or three inches taller than other standard-sized shirts which spoiled me and now I order tall shirts from all other companies. I consider them nearly perfect shirts year-round but the price I only have 3 because after shipping they run over $20 a piece from Duluth and no Duluth does not have Amazon Prime shipping. Nice very nice but expensive to build a wardrobe with.Carhartt Big-Tall Work Wear Short-Sleeve t-shirt: Material is as thick as Duluth shirt. I ordered this in tall and is 1 inch longer than the standard-length Longtail-T from Duluth as a result. Not quite as generous fitting as the Duluth shirt but it's a good bit larger girth than the other brand shirts. Material is slightly rougher feeling than the Duluth but still comfortable even when bending non-stop. Costs $15 with Amazon Prime 50% more than the Hane's and Dickie's but at least $5 cheaper than a Duluth shirt.My summary is the Carhartt wins overall. Thick enough long enough and I tested mine in 100 degree heat recently. Like the Duluth shirt the thicker material worked to help wick sweat away longer than thinner shirts will. But I live in a very humid area a few miles from the Mississippi river. Very humid Mid-Spring to Fall. Lots of people might not need to fight humidity this much. I can stock 4 Carhartt shirts for a buck or two cheaper than 3 Duluth shirts and anyone who works outside often knows you can often go through two shirts or maybe even three on a hot work-day in order to keep dry. So that means I can stock up on 12 shirts instead of 9 going Carhartt to carry me through a whole week without running out of shirts even when a certain family member (you know who you are in each family) hides them in a clothes pile somewhere for a few days. The savings is enough to make a big difference for anyone buying a few shirts.,0

I was very sceptical about purchasing this shirt since many complained about the fitting. When it arrived a day ahead of schedule and my husband tried it on I was relieved. I've purchase from cathartic website many times befor but we were going away on a whim and he needed a few new tee shirts. This is not too light weight nor too heavy it a medium weight shirt and fits just perfect. With the added benefit of a small percentage of synthetic fibers I don't antisapate any shrinkage. If I do I will update this review. My husband is a big man (and has lost weight recently which I'm very proud of him in succeeding ) not too tall in the bodice and this covers his belly very good. We love carhart products for their durability like another brand we use. Will purchase again.,0

December 28  2015By J. Burnett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These are without a doubt the best scrub pants I have ever owned (and I've been a nurse for 20 years).Fit: I'm a chubby girl with no rear end and these fit me perfectly. I get the 2x petite. I don't even have to use the drawstring. Just the elastic is perfect to hold them up.Fabric: I'm pretty sure this stuff is made by aliens in some advanced civilization. It stretches just enough. It always retains its shape. And it stretches everywhere not just at the seams.Style: the fabric is richly colored (I love the black pants most of all). There is a lot of seam-work on these and they use  a slightly contrasting color. So you see the seams but they look good. On each pair there's a cargo pocket on the leg that has a stretchy bright yellow loop. I guess you can thread scissors or hemostats through it. I'm not sure really what it's for. But it jazzes it up a bit and it's cute. And since it's stretchy I can play with it while I'm stuck on hold for ages ordering a test! The cargo pocket is actually a large pocket in the back that has a small mesh pocket within it that's good for holding a small phone or pager-type device. Then layered over that is a split pocket. So for one pocket patch you get 4 pockets. And you have the typical pants pockets (slash type) as well.Stability: I work 5 days a week and I have 5 pairs so they all get washed every single week. And they still look brand new 6 months later. I don't baby them either. They get thrown in there with the rest of my dark clothes on a regular warm cycle. And they look great.TLDR: they're magic buy them.,0

Contacted Amazon for a return.  they are comfortable but the pilling was unbelievable.  Even washed them carefully. I've had this pair now for several weeks. I can honestly say every time they're washed they pill. I use a hand razor to shave off the pilling which is a bit of a pain. What I will say is - they pill less if you wash them wrong side out. I disagree with some of the reports that they are uncomfortable. I find them to be very comfortable. In fact I plan to get more of them - I find the comfort is worth having to deal with the pilling.UPDATE:  I loved the comfort of wearing these so much I was determined to keep them. I did shave the pilling off I will tell you that after about four or five washes they pill much less. It usually occurs on the top thighs or on the tummy part and nowhere else.  Believe it or not they are so comfortable that I went ahead and ordered three more pair. I am also ordering some more today. The comfort is worth the effort of having to run a razor quickly over them and use a sticky roller. It only takes me about a minute or two to do it and then my pants are good to go for the day. I am  at work in the nursing home 5 to 7 days a week and I have never been too hot and my wonder when pants. As you know nursing homes are kept at a much higher temperature than most places.

October 11  2016By Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The stitching and sizing seem inconsistent-- the first two pairs i bought loved and wore out until they got thin (i'm definitely ah fuller on the bottom) and i did think they ran a little larger but that just made them more comfy. when i ordered another two pairs they were tighter around the waistband and thighs and even granted that i gained a little weight i don't think it should have made such a huge difference that one pair fit great the last day i wore them and the next day the new pairs were cutting into my waist. further the stitching on one of the new ones was uneven and the little slit at the bottom of one leg was up front with my shoelaces and not on the side. i guess next time i'll order a size up if they changed the sizing but i'm a little more skeptical of these now than prior.,0

Lots of pockets the seams are strong/well done on the pants themselves and on the pockets. They have a little stretch (not a ton as I thought they'd have based on the four way stretch description) the rise is very pleasantly NOT low rise and the fabric is going to work very well in a house full of pets. Fur isn't gonna bury itself in these. My only issue is that they're really flared at the bottom which I didn't expect. They're not wide-legged they actually flare. It's a little 2008-looking but they're long enough that they'll puddle over my clogs or hiking shoes and it will be less obvious. I may be able to roll them though the fabric may not be hefty enough to hold up in a roll. I intend to wear them around the house around the campsite in the evening and when I'm doing yardwork so who cares right? Good buy for the price!",0

Am very glad I took a chance on these pants!! I didn't realize they weren't even cotton or a blend but instead a loose ripstop type material that is super-comfortable and forgiving.  Also I don't think they'll need ironing if you just let them drip dry as the material has a wavy texture to it.  Reminds me of dri-fit clothes you'd wear for exercise.  They do seem to run a tiny bit big--I'm 5'4 and 120 got a medium because my hips are slightly wide but probably could have gone done a size.  Since they're drawstring though they don't look baggy.  Lots of pockets great quality they touch the ground without shoes and just barely with sneakers on.  Will definitely order some more.  I got 2 Peek-a-boo tops too and the colors are bright--again a smaller size might have been even better since the medium is very loose (34 bust) but not sending it back for this price.,0

Finding tough ladies' work pants had me SO aggravated!  November 10  2016By NJ K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Update!  As I hoped these softened some with washing without losing any of their toughness. Will definitely be buying more!I needed tough work pants and could only find lighter-weight ones offered 'for ladies'. Hubby bought these in his size and loves them so I decided to risk ordering them for myself. I am 5'2"" 25"" waist 35"" hips 107 lbs. I got the smallest ones offered (28x30)and they fit fine!! A bit stiff the first wearing - I did not wash before wearing as we are in the middle of a building project and I wanted to test them right away.  They fit comfortably at my real waistline (not low riding or hip huggers).  I can move freely (climbing ladders etc.) and they don't pull up or fall down with or without a belt.  The fabric is very tough and putting kneepads in them made kneeling on concrete surprisingly comfortable.  The only very minor negative I can mention is the lack of cargo pockets on the front for my gloves - and only because I'm accustomed to BDUs with loads of pockets!  Ladies this was a very pleasant surprise so if you're looking for work pants that are tough and can stand up to cactus yucca mud dirt etc. etc. try these out.",0

December 24  2015By Josh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I haven't owned a pair of Carhartt jeans in over 15 years closer to 20 as the last time I had them I was working as a carpenter. I now run a welding/fabricating/mechanic/maintenance operation on a fleet of car haulers so I've been in the market for work wear that has very high demand set on it. After reading some of the lower reviews on here about Carhartt I was a bit skeptical but I took sizing into consideration based on reviews for this particular pair of pants.I couldn't be more impressed. These pants fit lovely exactly the way they did when I was young. They're comfortably firm in the waist and perfectly loose and flexible everywhere you need tbem to be. I have to roll under trucks weld in odd inverted positions crawl out of car windows and climb trailers all night to secure loads- these pants are exactly what I need.The main deciding factor on choosing these pants is Carhartt's wise decision to move manufacturing back to the U.S.- the same reason I continue to buy Red Wings boots. I'll gladly pay more for superior materials and craftsmanship- and it butters another Americans bread as well so it is a triple win at that point.The inseam is a bit long on these pants but who cares? It won't be long before they start to fray out at the bottoms and the extra length will buy me a lot more use out of them.Sign me up for a bunch more in the market for more Carhartt work wear too- jackets hoodies etc.,0

They are made of heavy duty cotton duck and are especially useful during cold weather. I highly recommended these to professional tradesmen as they stand up to anything you can throw at them. Also if your an outdoorsman these are ideal for camping hiking or any outdoor activity. And by the way they look great and can be used for casual wear. Once they have been laundered a few times they be come very soft and comfortable. These will quickly become your favorite pair or casual everyday wear. Try them out you won't be disappointed!,0

I get about a year out of a pair before the crotch and pockets finally give. That's a record.These might cost a bit more than Dickies and even some other made in the USA brands (looking at you Roundhouse and Stan Ray) but the quality really is much better. There's a reason everyone tries (and in my opinion fails) to copy the old B01.My only small gripe is I wish they still came in a 28"" inseam and offered them in Navy or denim.",0

I own a landscaping and irrigation company in AZ and I wear these almost every day. I switch them out with the brown pair.  It's now May so they might be a little warm during our 110+- coming in June July and August but we will see. Quality is superb!  If you're on the fence DO NOT HESITATE. These are the best and made in the USA!  I did just order the Carhartt Force Tappen Cargos and they will probably be what I wear here in AZ during summer. The colder states would probably be fine year round.SIZINGI wear a 36x32 in Levis 501 and the waste on the carhartts is similar but the inseam is pretty long. I ordered the 36x32 in brown and they are way long (fit more like 36x34) but I don't mind too much. If you're riding a motorcycle or horse you will like the added length. I ordered the black in 36x30 and I would say they fit closer to a 36x32 if you were comparing to levis 501.,0

After drying these may be about 1/2"" - 3/4"" longer than other carhartts. I found this out the hard way with returning the original 34x32 and ordering 2 pairs of 34x30 and washing only to find out they turned into high waters for me. I ended up buying another 2 pairs of 34x32 and washed and it ended up at abluttle longer length but That didn't bother me much.Made in the USA! These Carhartt pants run longer than their regular canvas pants but those all fit differently depending on where they are made. I normally wear 34x32 in other Carhartts but these I had to return to get 34x30. I purchased these in black moss and gravel and all fit the same.",0

They were true to size and fit my son perfectly. My husband only wears Carhartts Double Front jeans which have all been purchased locally in our small town. Ranging from $58-$70+sales tax. The label on local bought Carhartts say Made In Mexico. Each pair of my husbands locally bought Carhartts all fit differently even though they are the same style & size.This pair of Carhartts from Amazon are of better quality and has a label of ""Made In The USA"" on the waistband.

Connolly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this based on a particular review and I am glad I did. I treated all of our suede/faux suede with this product and we've had no leaks in the last 8 or so weeks. I sprayed the kids' Merrell loafers my Solomon winter ""shoes"" and my daughter's and my faux Uggs (Costco) and we've all been in wet weather.I sprayed twice as recommended. I did this outside (and left them out there for about four hours after) because there would not be enough ventillation inside especially in the winter. Plus it's got to have _something_ unhealthy in it and I don't want that even lingering in my home. (Plus we have 4 cats and this would defintiely irritate their lungs).The spray's smell is very strong. Make sure you are upwind. Also watch how you spray. I wore an old shirt I didn't mind ruining and the spray did get on it and my hand just a little. But I can't even tell now--no problem in either case.I recommended spraying a little extra on the seams including where the suede meets the rubber at the bottom.I am not sure when I will need to treat again to avoid leaks.Don't do what my friend did with a similar product. Don't lay out your rain clothes (slicker and pants) on the deck and spray them. After they dry and you pick them up and then it rains you will have an outline of a body.",0

October 18  2015By Tamara,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm not sure if it works as I had to scrub and put my shoes in the wash machine to remove the ugly yellow color that this product left on my shoes. Don't ruin an expensive pair of shoes. It may be fine on leather is my guess. Maybe it says to test a small area on the product? More than likely it does. Lady Foot Locker sells a shoe protector that I was too lazy to go to the mall and buy. I've used it for a few years. One day I was wearing bright pink Nikes stepped into mud all the way to the top of the shoe. I took the shoe off went to my sink and it rinsed off like it never happened. I'm rating this product at 3 stars I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it doesn't turn leather yellow-ish. Lesson learned I can't buy everything on Amazon.,0

I used one can for six pairs of boots 2 coats each as instructed. 4 of those 6 were knee-high boots so I think you could easily do 10-12 pairs of shorter shoes/boots with one can. All of my boots are synthetic including two pairs that are synthetic suede (black and gray). The only boots that changed color a bit were a pair of ""cheap"" PU boots from Target which went from a light brownish-gray to a darker brownish-gray. However those boots already had dark water stains around the toes and so spraying them actually made them uniform in color and better-looking. After letting everything dry for 2 days I wore those Target boots out in the rain for a test run (before risking the nicer boots). Success! Dry feet and the boots looked fine afterward. Will be ordering more of this to do a few other shoes.Definitely use it outside though -- it smells very strong. I brought the boots inside after 12 hours because I didn't want to leave them out beside the backdoor overnight. I put them in the bathroom and closed the door (to keep cats away from them) and bathroom was VERY stinky very fast and made me lightheaded if I didn't run the fan while I was in there. But it aired out quickly and the smell dissipated once the boots were removed.",0

Unfortunately the product that I used the first time around wasn't an aerosol. It was one of those waterproof products that come in a plastic bottle with a manual push button design. Since I have arthritis in my hands I found that the push button design was almost impossible for me to use as my thumb would go numb after just a few pushes. Thankfully I found this item for sale on Amazon.As the directions state I treated each boot than let them sit for 4 hours. Than I repeated the process. Aside from the 4 hour interval the entire treatment for a pair of boots took less than 5 minutes. It left me with no pain and did a fabulous waterproofing job. Now I'm all set for whatever winter brings on.The bottom line is that this product performs as advertised and is easy to apply. It's also gentle on your thumb if you have arthritis. I would estimate that there's enough liquid in the bottle to double treat at least 6 pairs of heavy winter boots. This is definitely a great product for the money.,0

Even though this is 10 oz 2/3 of the bottle did that 303 fabric guard 32oz couldn't do. the result was very good too. if you think all the waterproofing spray is the same and then you are wrong. there are real differences in consistency. this sprays the right amount and covered large areas.

I LIKE!! See full review.  February 18  2016By Craig SoCal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"These pants are very nice I like the fit. I am 5'11"" 175 Lbs and the 34W/32L size fits even though I normally wear a 32-33 waist. The length seems consistent with most other pants but the waist does seem to run a bit small. The overall fit is nice and loose not baggy just the way I like my pants to fit. Not as thick or ""heavy"" as typical jeans but not overly thin either. Kind of in the middle. I prefer thin and these are somewhat thin but I have thinner pants and would actually be fine if these were a bit thinner but that's just me. They can be worn with just about anything even a sport coat for a very semi-formal or business casual gathering. They also look great with a t-shirt tank or a nicely pressed Tommy Bahama shirt. The pant legs and crotch area are comfortably loose (not baggy) and they are wide enough at the bottom that they don't bunch up around your ankles. I hate that! People like that? These will ""drape"" over your shoes unlike the overly popular annoying and ridiculous looking ""skinny"" pants that are so common nowadays. They ARE a bit ""cargo-ish"" but kind of tastefully so and NOT overloaded with goofy looking pockets like typical (juvenile) cargo pants. They seem a bit more suited for the ""untucked shirt look"" but I haven't tried them with a tucked shirt and a sport coat but I suspect it would look just fine with the right choice of shirt (and shoes)! I like the fit and the look and my wife approved and she usually disapproves of my attire selections. Also the twill material is nice and ""cottony"" and is NOT a fuzz and pet hair magnet and I like that this material DOES NOT attract static cling like some pants do. I will probably buy a couple of other colors and these will be my ""go to"" casual pants for a couple of years until something else comes along and tickles my fancy.",0

I am a huge fan of Carhartt and their wonderfully durable clothing especially their pants. Carhartt KNOWS their pants. I have them in every grade of thickness from the heavy-duty 12 oz. dungarees to the duck double-front ones to the lightweight canvas carpenter pants. Aside from formal wear a few pairs of chinos and hiking pants I don't wear anything else.These middleweight pants are the perfect compromise between work-ready durability and clothes you can wear around town being of a narrower cut and lighter-weight fabric than Carhartt's iconic heavy duty pants which while famously durable are just intolerable in hot weather. The tool pockets and hammer loop are still there but they're unobtrusive enough not to clash with an Oxford shirt and a sport coat. The one pair I've bought will by no means be my last.,0

And it's so hard for him to find pants that fit him as he's tall and slender--weighs 170 and is 6'2"".  Going to department stores is just futile.  Department stores rarely have his size in stock and looking for his size is like looking for a needle in a haystack.These are awesome in every way.  They're easy to wash and dry and fold without any wrinkles.

December 14  2016By ErikBVerified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought several styles of Carhartt pants from Amazon to try in my size.  I expected some differences in fit obviously as the different styles were advertised as having their original loose or relaxed fit (from roomiest to skinniest).  Still I was very surprised that the pair of these that I received was extremely tight and much much smaller than the other styles.  Hopefully I just got a fluke because as I write this about 71% of other reviewers said they thought it fit true to size.  My experience was that would only be true for hipsters who want skin-tight and constricting pants.  I sent these back but did keep some other Carhartt relaxed fit pants in the same size.  Go figure.  Aside from the fit the fabric was indeed much softer-feeling than any of the other styles I tried on account of it being washed twill.  As for thickness and stiffness it was reasonably good not as thick and stiff as my jeans or some classic Carhartt B11's but not as thin as dress pants.,0

Several people have commented that they fit small and to size up in the waist.  My own experience has been pretty consistent that the actual waist fits well but as someone with fairly muscular thighs the legs are on decent but slightly on the slim side (I wish they were another 1/4-1/2"" across each thigh when measured flat). I like them because I actually wear them both in an office setting (I removed the hammer loop and wear them with oxfords and sweaters) as well as in the shop setting (wood working and welding; if/when I ruin them they are cheap enough to replace without much worry but last well otherwise).",0

Since they just arrived I can't talk about durability but I can offer some initial impressions.  The fabric is a cotton twill which simply means it's very similar to what you might find in a pair of casual Dockers pants and frankly I thought given the nature of the pants might be a bit heavier fabric.  While described as a ""relaxed"" fit and that term varies by manufacturer they certainly aren't as ""relaxed"" as my Sam's Club jeans and seem to run about a 1"" waist size small.  I would have hoped that a ""work pant"" where the wearer might regularly be bending or kneeling would be a bit more generously cut.I'm thinking about sending them back but going up 2"" in the waist might be too much.",0

Well constructed... triple stitched in the areas that count and an overall sturdy feel3. Looks sharp ... got these in black and the overall style / cut of these pants looks great.4. Versatile ... these are easily everyday / any occasion  pants (especially in black). Wear them to work the office with a tee shirt or even as casual dress pants. They really fit the bill whether it's laid back attire or somewhat dressed up.5. It's not easy finding a good pair of reasonably priced black pants that is not a lint magnet ... these Carhartts are great in this regard no lint magnet.Overall a great pair of pants. .. will buy again. Thumbs up Carhartt!,0

I recently lost quite a bit of weight so I was hesitant to check the fits larger than expected box so I wanted to qualify that with it may just be my weight loss that makes them seem too big. Also I have no butt so scrubs always fit me kinda funky. I ordered a medium which was the size I wore the last time I was this weight (150#). That being said I like these enough that I am going to order them in a small and see if I like that fit better. And even though these are large on me I'll still wear them. You should try a pair!,0

November 25  2016By Oldbean,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These crocs run a little big so you should buy 1 size down.  I work in a kitchen and these really reduce the fatigue on your feet.  I've had my current pair for two years and they're still going strong.  The last pair I had worked great until I left it in my car on a hot day and they shrank and completely deformed.  The non slip works great unless you get the bottom gunked up with a bunch of flour.  The shoe material doesn't give much airflow so the shoes can begin to smell after a short time.  Cleaning it with rubbing alcohol or baking soda and water seem to keep the smell away though.Pros:extremely comfortableeasy to slip on and offeases feet fatiguenonslip works greateasy to cleanCons:lack of airflowno ankle supportwill shrink and deform if you leave in your carsize runs a bit large,0

Comparing it to these black ones from Amazon the shoe is smaller than I expected since crocs advice to order a size down but I ordered an 8 in women still and they fit perfectly. These are a lot lighter than my batali edition. It is also narrower not roomy fit. I can barely feel the nubs on the foot bed. It also says  made in Vietnam vs the batali which is made in China.These are a lot lighter though & still pretty comfortable.

Uniforms Work & Safety,B0034KZE9U,crocs Unisex Bistro Clog,        8 of 8 people found the following review helpful       Great for kitchen work  January 25  2014By K.J. Dogluv,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"So...Crocs DO run big. I now wear a size 9 or even sometimes 9.5 in men's shoes but in CROCS I wear a size 8 men's/10 women's (they are unisex). They still feel a bit big but the thing is it's because they are so wide at the top. I have bunions so this is great for ME and also if you are on your feet for hours your feet swell a bit. When I first got these years ago I felt like they were gonna come off my feet but they did not even if I don't use the heel strap. They end up kinda conforming to your foot and almost get ""tighter"" over time. The non-slip bottom is truly non-slip even on greasy or really wet floors. I wouldn't recommend them necessarily for dog walking around the block on icy walks as this particular siped non-slip tread (siping is basically tiny cuts or openings in a tread they do it to tires as well) is really meant for floors not ice but that said I HAVE walked my dog in slippery conditions and been ok. I use my older ones as shoes to put on when I do a quick potty walk or have to hose something off even gardening tasks. I just got a new job and am in a kitchen environment again so ordered this new pair just for that as we have to wear black. My old ones are at least 5 years old and the tread is still good actually. You can't hurt these things you really can't. You can wipe 'em clean they don't stink and they ARE ugly as sin but hey function over form is the way to think about CROCS in this case. Most CROCS don't really have a function but these ones definitely do and in my opinion are the best kitchen shoes I've had. FYI I also like Dickie's work shoes with the non-slip tread I got them at Costco for $20 but they are not quite as comfortable as these CROCS.",0

October 23  2016By MomReviews4You,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My husband is a Sous Chef and he needed some new shoes. He just wanted a pair of crocs to hold him over until he could buy something better these definitely fit the bill.He really likes these shoes and they seems to hold up well to working 12-15 hour shifts on his feet all day long.The only downside (he has said) is that his feet sweat really bad in the crocs (he wears moisture wicking socks too) and since there's no fabric on Crocs there isn't anywhere for the moisture to go. His feet just stay really wet. That's the only downside... I haven't found a solution to that problem yet and I probably won't find one.,0

April 21  2016By opera.mad,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,20 months or so ago I purchased a pair of Bistro directly from the Crocs website and was supremely happy with my choice. At the time I followed other reviewers' advice to purchase the clogs 1 size smaller at 6 Women's/4 Men's than my usual size of 7 W/5 M. As mentioned I could not be happier with my Crocs which I still currently work in despite their falling apart soles. Compared to working in a busy kitchen environment with any other shoes (I work a lot!) my experience with my old Bistro clogs (made in China) was blissful. I also learned from other buyers that Crocs made in China are somewhat roomier than the ones made in Mexico. This turned out to be an important distinction. Fast forward to this recent purchase from ShoeBuy (the vendor) via Amazon these Crocs were made in Mexico (a fact not mentioned or the sizing difference explained in the product description). I cannot say anything about their wear outside of the sizing as these Crocs are too small for me to even put on. When I was making the purchase I actually tried to order in my correct size (7 W/5 M) but was advised by Amazon that based on my size and previous purchases to go for size 6 W/4 M. For the last week I have been trying unsuccessfully to return these too-small clogs to ShoeBuy (minus restocking fee) in order to repurchase Bistro in a larger size but that is another story.The takeaway moral of this tale is to(a) make sure you know the manufacturing source and provenance of the clogs (made in Mexico or China); and(b) avoid purchasing from ShoeBuy even if their prices may be slightly lower than other vendors. I requested a refund (minus restocking fee) and was promised a return shipping label within an hour twice once via email and the last time over the phone with their sales rep. Still no return shipping label after a week (I do know all about checking spam and other email folders).Avoid ShoeBuy avoid avoid! (but that is another story unrelated to the wear and sizing of Bistro Crocs (which I adore).,0

Schoonover,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I hate these shoes.  Yes I gave a five star rating and I hate them.  I'm a cook and I have to wear non-slip footwear to work.  I have tried MANY different non-slip shoes over the course of a decade and these are the most reliable easiest to clean affordable and utilitarian shoes I've found.  My feet never hurt.  Let me repeat that.  My feet NEVER hurt.  But here's the thing.  These shoes are so ugly.  I hate wearing them.  And they do not breathe at all.  But they allow me to do my job without having to worry about my feet and that is legitimately all I can really ask of a work shoe.  So I will continue to order these stupid shoes every 9-12 months when the non-slip bottom wears out until I graduate from college and can FINALLY tell the company for whom I work to suck it.,0

Standard relaxed and roomy.I've been wearing these shoes Propet Men's Life Walker Strap SneakerBlack13 X (US Men's 13 EEE) which are triple E and these Bistro shoes are wider. These are some of the most roomy shoes I've ever had on. It's almost like not wearing a shoe at all. Which is exactly what I wanted.Go to the Crocs website and in the search box type in 'roomy fit.'

Uniforms Work & Safety,B0034KZE9U,crocs Unisex Bistro Clog, Incredibly comfy  but not at all durable  and only moderately slip resistant (sometimes not at all!) - Beware!  June 4  2016By mm cookiesVerified Purchase(What's this?),2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Great feel spacious comfy and easy to keep clean but not at all durable. The 'non-slip' soles frequently slip (even though both stores I've used them at have anti-slip tiling) and have peeled off the shoe twice. I have had to reattached the soles with super glue but that was only a temporary fix as they are wrapped up drying again for the second time as I type this. The soles peel off startiting from the front which means you'll be tripping over floppy soles and slip n sliding all over the place. Initially the grip was fairly decent only minor slipping which I chocked up to grease and such on the floor but even after using the sprayer at work to clean the grease out of the soles and after scrubbing down the floors I still noticed slipping - in the recent weeks I've almost fallen on multiple occasions because the grip is just nonexistent at this point even though the soles are only moderately worn at the edges (not exactly a comfortable experience considering the myriad of hot surfaces and sharp edges I would have to catch myself on in the even I actually do fall - and I don't think crocs would compensate for lost wages in the event of an injury)Asked my boss about his crocs slipping and he said he has had no problems but from the look of his shoes and the soles he has the 'specialist' crocs - which are more low-slung on the tops and have different soles (this pair is definitely not as 'stream-lined' as the 'specialist' pair which looks like it has  bit better breathability) looking back I should have returned these after the first week of slipping but working full time didn't leave me an opportunity to wait for new shoes in the mail while these were on their way back. Now that they're on their last leg I just purchased a pair of the 'specialist' no-slip crocs and hopefully those will be just as comfy and actually not slip instead of surprising me constantly with a life-and-death game of ""can you regain your footing?""This particular 'bistro' model of shoe should honestly be discontinued by Crocs due to the pants-shatting experience of constant slipping in the kitchen.",0

We usually replace his shoes about every 2 months they inevitably break down where he squats and the soles crack the inserts come out....he's just extremely hard on shoes. We've bought cheap shoes and good quality shoes they all tear up and hurt his feet. For years he came home complaining about his feet constantly. But these Crocs have been amazing. His feet do not hurt at all even when he's on them for 10-12 hours at a time. They show typical wear on the soles from walking and getting scuffed but structurally they are still just fine. He has worn them every single day for over a year now (he doesn't have another pair of shoes just these) and they are just as perfect today as they are the day we got them. He also has a problem with foot odor but these are great for that not only do they not absorb odor (like cloth canvas or leather does) he can just wash them out with soap and water if they do get dirty.

I bought the wide because the Normal width wasn't available and it was the answer to my pinched toes. I'd rather tighten the laces than hope my shoes stretch.

These were a little too big but I kept them anyway. I then decided to buy a second pair and ordered a 9 which fit perfectly although with wear Skechers are notorious for stretching in the width way too much. Both pairs did. I want a pair of lace-ups to secure my feet better to walk around the neighborhood in so I ordered these D'Lites Centennial sneakers in a size 9 because of what happened with the others. They arrived and were way too small in length. I returned them and ordered a 9.5 which just arrived and are also too small in length. The left shoe is better fitting but the right feels exactly like the size 9 did!

I wear a size 8.5 wide I should have ordered a size 8 they were a little too long but other wise very fitting and really nice looking. The only problem is you really can't RUN with these sneakers. They are made for walking purposes in my opinion and experience. When I tried to run on the treadmill the soles are really ""clunky"" thick and I end up stumbling every now and then because the rubber catches against the treadmill or when I try jogging outside I stumble on the sidewalk or concrete surfaces not really used to such a difference in step with the thick soles.Don't let that deter you from the sneakers though if you like to walk or stand a lot these are really comfortable and take a lot of stress off my back and knees.",0

However when I started going to the gym and walking on a treadmill my feet hurt constantly due to the Skechers I had not being supportive enough. My husband had the men's version of these and told me I should try them as they were thickly padded and very supportive. I ordered a pair. At first I wasn't sure. They were very hard compared to my other Skechers. They fit about the same but they weren't comfortable at all. But from the first time I wore them to the gym I was in heaven on the treadmill! I can walk for miles in these on the treadmill which I can't do with my other Skechers. The support is amazing. After a few days the hardness wore off and now they are my go-to shoes for the gym. If you need firm support and can get past the initial stiffness these are definitely for you!,0

They are very comfy and supportive. I get sore heals and I have found that these prevent that the best. They are also pretty slip resistant - I also work on wet floors. They hold up pretty well too considering how hard on them I am. I usually go through 2 pairs a year but keep in mind that's 50 hours a week of non stop abuse that they take. I usually spray them with a simple sneaker water proofer and my feet never get wet even stomping through the snow on my way to and from work. They are well worth the money. I know my mom also a pair that she's been wearing for years. So considering that I have bought approximately 15 pairs of these sneakers - I would say that I highly reccomend them. The only way they could get any better is if the company would throw me a free pair considering the amount that I have purchased - haha...,0

At first I could only wear them for short periods being new. As I wear them more they are getting easier on my feet. I have degenerative disk disease and flat feet so I can't wear certain shoes. I need something that is firm with a thick sole and this shoe is it. Although it looks big and heavy it is not. It still has a lightness that is easy for me and doesn't tire me out with all the walking I have to do.There is also enough room for my arch supports no cramming.Another positive my toes and feet don't get cramps wearing these as with some other styles.I would like to get this in other colors as well.

I practically frolic within it.  The heavy duck is rich in color and warmth.  The cuffs are impenetrable to snow and wind.  The hood... oh the hood.  When pulled up over my head I am shielded not only from the blowing snow and rain but also the human misery that surrounds me.I cannot recommend this jacket enough.  The description and sizing are dead on.  It is ridiculously well-made.,0

I wouldn't consider them highly fashionable but they do have a nice styling and are very recognizable. They are made of strong materials and are warm enough for my local midwest winters. These jackets are very stiff when they're new and can take months or even a whole winter to loosen up. To me that just means it will last a very long time.The fit: these jackets fit slightly large even compared to other coats and jackets which are supposed to be larger than shirts etc. However they are a little on the short side. I am 6'1 and a normal XL fits me well but if you are used to Big&Tall clothes or like a jacket with a little extra length go for the Tall sizing. Sometimes tall sized jackets and shirts can be extremely long like a rapper's white T shirt. I've tried on Tall Carhartt jackets and they are not TOO tall FWIW.Carhartt jackets are truly ""buy it for life"" items which is becoming more and more rare as we move into an era where everything is disposable. If that is something you appreciate get this one! If you are considering this jacket as a gift: I am a 26 year old guy and I think any young guy would like to have one!!",0

January 7  2016By Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This jacket fits me perfectly. I bought this jacket as a replacement to a Carhartt J130 size Large because the large seemed to allow too much air in underneath the jacket around my waist.  This time I got the Medium tall and that seems to be the ideal fit for me. The large didn't fit me as snugly as I wanted and I didn't want to have to wear a bunch of bulky clothes underneath it. I am 6'0"" 150 lbs so this jacket will serve me well and I really like the material. It keeps the wind out and you can wear layers underneath it. They seem to run a bit on the larger size in sizing I think. I like the medium tall because it comes around my pockets which keeps the wind from whipping up my back or my sides when I am walking outside and keeps the jacket from slipping up when I am working outside in the cold. The winters in Nebraska are pretty chilly at times with highs in the teens and the snow will stay on the ground for months at a time so this is definitely a great jacket for the price and durability. The material is the highest quality and really keeps out the wind so that's what I love about Carhartt jackets. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.",0

But I ordered a 2 over a 3 anyways.. It seems pretty big on me. I would imagine it is built that way for layering under work shirts and thermals. Also due to the stiff nature of the fabric the sleeves kind of hold a ROUND shape instead of the fabric falling which even makes it look bigger. I imagine after ready the other reviews that it wills soften and shrink a bit.. I am 6'4"" so I ordered the tall 2X as well as the reg 2X to see which one fit best. The reg fit good but It came down right right to my belt line. Any kind of movement outside raising my arms resulted in my stomach area being exposed. The 2XL tall is about 3 inches longer and I feel works better for tall people to avoid wind getting up under the jacket constantly.I have only worn it once outside with nothing but a t-shirt on underneath in about 55 degree weather and was sweating to death lol. So It does work well so far",0

January 15  2016By Teresa W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this for my son who became a truck driver and needed a very warm coat when he traveled north. He is 6'3 and 300 lbs I ordered a 2X large tall first and it was too snug. I sent it back and got him a 3X large tall and it is perfect. Gave details for anyone needing to compare size. He said it is comfortable and very warm fits what he needed very well. Not easy to find a coat in that size and in tall. I had no problem at all returning/exchanging the coat. Amazon was very easy to work with. Received fast and in great condition. Update: My son and I got to visit so I asked him how his coat was holding up he said it still looked almost new. The best part was that it didn't rip if he got it caught on something didn't even snag the material. I hope that I have helped you make an informed decision on whether to buy this coat or not.

Uniforms Work & Safety,B009YDCKNO,Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined…, Great coat  but fit is on the short side  January 17  2017By B. DouglasVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I actually returned this coat so this is only a review on the fit and not a commentary on durability or warmth. I wear a 3XL tall in shirts and a 4X regular will often also work for clothing that runs small. Since this would be going over my clothes I ordered the 4XL regular. The ""girth"" of the coat was perfect for the size but the coat was on the rather short side. If I were to raise my arms or attempt to bend over I would definitely be showing my mid-section or my back side. For a coat that I bought for some extra warmth this wasn't a good trait. The sleeves also seem a bit long for the size but I could've lived with that. All in all it seems like it would've been the perfect coat for warmth and durability but the short fit is what made me return it to exchange for another style Carhartt jacket in 4XLT size.",0
Uniforms Work & Safety,B009YDCKNO,Carhartt Men's Quilted Flannel Lined…, If you're about to order a medium  read this.  January 25  2016By J. StremfelVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"If you're reading the reviews about how these run a size large and are going to order a medium as a result STRONGLY consider getting the medium TALL. I bought this for just casual wearing (not doing physical labor or wearing over 3+ layers). I just wanted a nice looking and warm jacket so I got a medium so it wasn't overly big on me. I'm 5'10"" and about 190 lbs but I have a longer torso so I'm usually a large. The medium fit me well in the shoulders. However the sleeve and body length were too short. Whenever I bend my arms too much or reached up for something my forearms and stomach were exposed which made me not want to move around a lot in it and I got in the habit of pulling the jacket down to try and make it longer. The medium tall solves this problem. So if you're actually a large in regular jackets/shirts and getting a medium for a tighter fit get a medium tall if you're on the taller side or have a longer torso. The only difference between the medium and medium tall is that the sleeve length and body length for the medium tall are both 2"" longer which is perfect.",0

I'm wearing these now having received them just under an hour ago.The new fabric is stiff but not scratchy or uncomfortable. The thickness is nice; they don't feel like they'll tear easily. The loose fit is very convenient for kneeling crouching sitting etc. The hidden metallic zipper and buckle are typical of most industrial clothing but it's well executed (none of that nonsense where you have to do a button hidden in a pocket just a simple hook fastener). The pockets are spacious and the cell phone pocket is appropriately sized and should fit even the largest of mobile devices (my co-worker's iPhone 6 plus fits perfectly although sitting or kneeling would cause it to fall out).After a couple washes it should soften up. Time will tell if these shorts will actually put up with the abusive environment they are designed for.Note that these belt loops are designed for thinner belts made for industrial work wear. Typical belts tend to be about an inch or so thick; they won't work in these shorts.,0

They are also available in a wide variety of colours too. Can't go wrong with that.,0

September 2  2016By Garrett Marris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought 2 pair of these shorts 3+ years ago and I've put them through daily hard use. Both pairs still hold up and I'm working in a pair right now. I run a pressure washing company and these things can hold up to the harshest chemicals I've thrown at them. I've burnt and cut holes in them and the holes don't rip. The main clasp (where the button is on other shorts) got a little loose after a few years and I just squeezed it together with some pliers and it's as strong as the day I bought them. The pockets have held nails screws razor blades you name it and there's not a hole in them. I'm a welder and these things are pretty resistant to slag and sparks and dont burn through easily.I couldn't recommend these shorts highly enough  and the only reason I need more is because these are covered in paint and I look like a slob when I bid on jobs.,1

They are sized to make you feel better about yourself not the actual size of your waste.For example I wear Old Navy ""loose"" jeans in a size 34""x34"". I'm an averaged sized athletic built guy. HOWEVER my true measurements are a 38"" waste and a 32"" inseam. This is how Dickies Carhartt and most dresswear(dress pants) are sized...by your ACTUAL SIZE not the fabricated size most popular companies use to sell everyday fashion clothes.When you buy jeans that are a 34""x34"" it makes you feel thin and tall....when you buy pants true to size(like Dickies Carhartt etc.) that are 38""x32"" in doesn't ""feel"" as good to say you wear a 38x32 instead of a 34x34. See what most clothing companies are doing here?....making you feel good right? It works...marketing.So by taking my ACTUAL WASTE SIZE (38) and using that measurement to buy my Dickies and Carhartt shorts that are sized PROPERLY they fit perfect...imagine that!Bingo...the secret fashion clothing companies don't tell you. Suprprise you're not a 34 you're really a 38!Measure yourself....guarantee your waste is about 4 inches bigger than your ""X"" brand jeans say it is.Oh yeah...review of the product. Dickies shorts are great for work and play...look good and tough as nails. Highly recommend.11"" shorts hit me about the knee standing and come above the knee sitting. These 13"" shorts are slightly below the knee standing and at the knee to partially covering the knee sitting.Hope my sizing info helps others! Buy your actual waste size(measure it with a flexible tape) and I guarantee they will fit properly. This is usually going to be roughly 4 inches bigger than what you think you wear but at least 2.",0

I'm glad I decided with the 40 over the 38 a little loose but I feel the 38 would have been snug.  How ever the length of 30 is inaccurate.  They feel as a 32 or even 34 as I need to cuff the bottom so I don't walk on the bottom of the pants.  Yes they are loose fit but I feel that they are more so baggy than loose.  I also am sort of disappointed with the material.  All the Dickies that in have bought over the years are very stiff thick material these are noticably thinner or light weight compared to the originals.

These shorts seem to be made from durable material much better than the shorts I wore for work before. And yes no button above the zipper it is clip-style like with dress pants.I had to take off one star from what would have been a 5 star rating because the front pockets (that hold your keys change and other items) seem narrow and shallow. I'm concerned about losing my pocket items during regular use. I may have to resort to a zipper equipped fanny pack for essential items.,0

If you want a jacket that is well made and will keep you safe in the lab this is a good choice and also the price is more than fair.

A lot of the stitching came out in my first washing (see below) but they have not frayed much since. I use these daily despite the loose stitching.  They are not square or evenly cut and will not fold into a triangle.  I am upgrading my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because the colors and fabric are actually very good.  It's the construction that's bad.-------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this 12 pack of 12 colors after reading the reviews of MANY of these Chinese made bananas.  Many reviews here complain they are not color-fast so I washed all 12 bandanas together three times with cool warm then hot water to let them bleed alone together and set the colors.ALL 12 BANDANAS ARE FALLING APART AFTER THREE WASHES ALONE.The stitching is beginning to unravel in several places and the ends are fraying !!The colors are nice the fabric is good but *ALL* bandanas are fraying ........ pathetic.I suggest you look elsewhere.,0

March 21  2016By Chelsea,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"For the price I know I shouldn't complain but... these aren't anything like the real bandanas I grew up with. The cotton is way too big a weave (too low thread count)  The thread they used to weave these is way too coarse. Hold them up to the light you can see straight through it.  I'm hoping they shrink in the wash and tighten up the weave.  The print is just shoddy.  If you are glancing at someone you'll just see ""bandana""  but if they are close to you and you look at it none of the print lines up properly and just isn't anywhere close to my bandanas that I've had since the 1970s.  You can definitely tell that pride in workmanship has lost out to mass production over the past decades.  I was expecting they would be a little less than ideal but never this bad.  On the up side... (and yes there is an up side)... they are inexpensive you do get 12 in a pack and my husband and my dogs don't give a hoot what they look like. They are a nice size hold my hair well in several different styles and I'm not complaining ""where's my bandana?"" all the time anymore.  There's always one at hand and clean.  They make great hankies too.  Buying these made me revere my old bandanas I've babied and pampered since high school all the more.  So I guess it's a good thing I now have a dozen every day bandanas so I save my good ones for the beach or camping where they will be seen by others.",0

I left them in the basket for my wife to wash thinking maybe they would feel right after a trip through the washing machine.  First words out of her mouth when she took them from the dryer ""I don't think you're going to like these bandanas.""Now the blue ones I ordered at the same time came from a different vendor Accessory World. I didn't find anything wrong with them.  But stay away from the cheap-@SS crap CCEnterprises is selling.  I'm out the return postage with nothing to show for it.

I did fold one up and put it in my pocket.  It is a bit bulkier than a normal sized handkerchief but again I will have to give this a further use trial before making a final decision on size.  When they soften up they should compress into a smaller size.

I have tried them all and am totally  sold on them!!  They can be worn right out of the washer practically with little to no drying required.  The fabric feels good against your skin and I have see nurses and technicians of all shapes and sizes wear them and look very attractive in them.  Even though we OR nurses aren't seen in a high profile setting my patients have commented on how attractive these scrubs are!

I order what I thought to be a XL size and even the 2 shirts I ordered are marked as XL's But there is NO!!!! way in hell that they are that size. I have given them to a friend that wears a Med. size shirt and if you hold them up side by side that is what they are a Med. NOT a XL as they are marked.. So I would like to have shirts that I could wear But I am very scared to reorder 2 more Not knowing if I will get some that will fit me or not and there is no way to get a hold of the seller to talk to them about the problem so I am just out $40.00.

July 29  2014By Kevin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Where to begin with this...well for starters it was shipped decently fast and arrived on time which was nice. And I was a little nervous ordering this from the other reviews that I read saying that it wasn't all that great but I did it anyways cause you know it was only 10 bucks and change.When I got it I noticed the light tan color that is shown in the picture is not what it looks like at all! it's actually a brown which doesn't match my ACU camo pants for airsoft which kind of made me sad. But I am going to wash it and hope that the brown color fades out to a lighter color so it matches better.As for the fit it is fairly slimming and not all that thick. This wouldn't do much against a bb or a paintball. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone for camo. I'm going to post a picture so you can we the colors.,1

I was considering real USMC MARPAT surplus/used but for the time being Rothco will do. If you are using this for airsoft or really anything wear it over a thicker shirt. For example in 45* (Fahrenheit) weather I wear a warm wool olive drab jacket and then I slip this over. The color blends well with the jacket and I get the warmth and feel of the jacket. I would also recommend you go a size higher and only buy one shirt at time... shipping is free order it to see if you like it before you buy 4 shirts and complain that they didn't fit.Overall 4/5 stars because of the cheap quality and material.,0

Because of that I'm not comfortable with is the ""feel"" of the shirt. I've only worn once for a few hours and will be careful not to allow my wife to dry it after it gets washed because she only knows one way to dry...high temperature and 60 minutes.

September 23  2016By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,It's comfortable for casual wear and although it's certainly not a tough shirt it's not flimsy either somewhere in the middle. If you are looking for a long sleeve to stay warm this is definitely not a cold-weather shirt. It might protect against a small chill but its definitely more of a casual or warmer weather shirt. One thing I would note is that I like to wear long sleeves and roll them up when the extra length isn't needed and this shirt has small wrist cuffs that make it difficult to do that; although it's still comfortable if you wear it long sleeve like you should.,0

The cotton blend material for this shirt is susceptible to all the problems which cause most people to stay away from cotton blend shirts:  thin cheap feeling material not shrink resistant.  Those who want 100% cotton generally prefer thicker material (5.3 or 6.1oz type shirts) and those who want 100% synthetic want lightweight shrink resistant and no-fade colors.

I recommend ordering a size smaller than your normal shirt size. I normally wear a medium and I ordered smalls so they fit more snug for working out and running. The smalls fit about like a medium size Hanes undershirt for reference. Unfortunately they have changed these to 100% polyester. They used to be 85% polyester 15% cotton (which is my preferred blend for exercise shirts). The new ones aren't nearly as soft as the old ones unless they soften up after a few washes. I liked that I could wipe sweat off my face better with the 15% cotton ones. Regardless these are still by far my favorite shirts for exercise. Lost one star for the 100% poly.,0

Nice tight (not suffocating) fit around the arms and chest. Also typically these type of poly shirts accentuate your belly if you have one like mine but I found these fall nicely flat from the ab/beer belly/gut thru the waste. I'm sure they'll look even better with six pack abs. Maybe in another life. Anyway definitely runs smaller and reading the other reviews is what made me go one size bigger. I probably would have even been safe going 2 sizes larger as it feels like they shrunk a little after the first wash. I use these to run 3-5 miles 4 times a week and they do their job. Doesn't feel heavy afterwards. I'd probably buy more of these when they go back on sale. Being phroogal myself I wouldn't pay more than $12-$15 for them.",0

They do seem to fit a bit snug.  I'm typically a large in these types of shirts but an XL might have been a more comfortable choice.  I'm 5'10"" and about 200 and fairly lean so that might be of some relevance here.  Bottom line is that you'll be happier if you go up a size for comfort and order your regular size for a more fitted athletic appearance; either way the variety of colors and good overall quality make this shirt worth it.",0

I thought the light grey would be a good test of this shirt's ability to wick given the lack of wiggle room the color usually affords. However I can walk to the sushi restaurant 4 minutes away from the gym and not look like a complete sweaty hog. My face will be wet but this shirt stays dry.This shirt won't make the cute girl at the gym look your way but your girlfriend won't completely disassociate you if you walk up to her wearing this after the gym.,0

Because they actually de_emphasize my waist as they are a mId_rise give my butt a little definition due to the rear flap pockets and have a straight leg... no flare which I prefer. Like your favorite pair of jeans these only get softer over time. They are sturdy...i still wear pairs that I have had for more than six years. Plus they have plenty of pockets for my gear.Complaints?  The bungee on the bottom can be a bit annoying as it will scrape the floor depending on the shoe I wear.  Also I always tuck the outer waist tie into my pants to avoid that extra waist bulge. I also like the Koi Morgan style pant...it has a wider straight leg and an inside tie.",0

February 12  2017By SamanthaVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have always loved the Koi Lindsey Cargo scrubs. When I first started where I work now I bought 6 pairs in the XL size. Overtime I gained weight and they didn't fit anymore. I searched endlessly for them in a XXL and tall (which are fairly hard to come by). I found this pair and was so excited! I received them in the mail today and the length is perfect. I am six foot tall and the problem with scrubs is when I sit and squat the rise up like high-water capris and I hate that! I am a larger individual (usually wear a size 20 pant) so the waist and butt is a little tight but the legs are perfect! I will say that with the white ones they are a little see-through so don't wear any dark underwear! I look forward to purchasing more!,0

I have worn a small tall (5'10) for years.  This pair and a couple of pairs I have tried from other sellers were longer.  All sellers currently advertise them as a 33 inch inseam.  Not so from a nurse who also does alterations.  That was accurate for my older ones but the pairs I have tried in the past year are 34+ which leaves them too long.  Interestingly enough the inseam is listed as 34.5 in some spring 2015 catalogs advertising Koi products.  Just be aware.  They fit as expected otherwise and are durable with a bit of shrinkage.  Too bad I can't wear them anymore regular inseam is too short and the current ""tall"" drags on the ground.  Might still work for those who cinch the bottoms but I don't.",0

By luck I found these and they are exactly the same without the cord design and I am thrilled.  They are light and comfortable perfect fit at the waist thank god  so you don't have to pull them up all night long they have flair legs which always make your legs look better and they are he perfect length which has always been an issue with scrub pants for me..either an inch to short or the talls are way too long.  I'm 5'8 and 149 lbs and the medium are perfect.  Now if I can find these with cargo pockets on the legs I'll be even happier.  I can't wear scrub pants that are low rise or just draw string  these are elastic back and part draw string.  Just perfect.  Now I can throw all my other pants out that I have to pull up all flipping night long...thank GOD.  These scrub pants are awesome!!!!! Yay Barco,0

July 29  2015By Wilma S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Slightly over sized but that is because this is a top that you need to be comfortable in for work/school. I typically wear a large but have been wearing a medium more recently. I bought three of these tops in a medium and they fit me perfectly. I was worried there would not be enough room in the chest area (I am a 36D and some mediums are too small) but this size is perfect. If you are unsure of sizing I would recommend trying tops on in store and ordering on line for a cheaper price. That is what I did.It is a scrub top therefore it is not extremely flattering but it does not look or feel like a potato sac. I love this color it looks great with brunette hair. Now that I know I like this top I will be ordering more.When reading reviews keep in mind that people always have something negative to say.I WOULD definitely recommend this product.,0

I usually stay way from Landau because they fit me horribly.  This pants actually fit pretty decent.  I got the color navy.I'd rate it more like 3.5 starsPros:- I like the fabric.  The cotton/polyester blend makes it comfortable to wear but can clean up well too.  The stretchyness of it is awesome.  I don't feel constricted as all.  I can bend down and not worry about my pants ripping.  I feel quite comfortable.- The belt loops.  The pants have drawstrings too but they aren't great.- I got the medium size fit and I'd say it has a straight leg profile which I am very happy about.  The fit is much better than Laudau's unisex brands (more baggy).- Decent pockets.  They have the two hand pockets two back pockets and two cargo pockets.Cons:- No short version.  I had to cut 3 inches off the bottom to make it fit me.  I normally wear 29-30"" inseam pants.- The cargo pockets make me go WTF.  The left cargo pocket is on the anterior thigh.  It isn't comfortable to put flushes or my phone here.  I love putting my phone in the cargo pockets.  But since the pocket is on the front it makes walking awkward.  I would have preferred to to stick to the side of the leg.  I'd have to stick with carrying papers for this pocket and nothing heavier.  The right cargo pocket isn't any better.  It is small and the pocket opening is horizontal with an annoying velcro piece.  I normally carry flushes in my cargo pockets but I can't with these because of the way the opening is position.  I don't even know what I can use this pocket for.  The pocket opening makes it awkward to reach in and get stuff.  Even with the velcro I'd still be afraid of small items falling out.  The hand pockets are nice.  The opening is more vertical which makes it easy to grab stuff out of it.  The back left pocket is where my phone goes now.  The right pocket has the annoying velcro piece.- If you got something in your pockets (e.g. keys phone etc) and your skin rubs over the top of the pants it leaves skin scuff (more issue for dark colors).  Not a big deal but annoying if you want to look clean.- If you don't want to wear a belt they have a drawstring on the inner side of the pants.  It would have been nice if the drawstring was a little beefier.  I find that I still have to use a belt.Overall:My choices were limited due to my hospital requirements and there isn't many choices for men fit.  But at the end of the day it fits it's comfortable and it works.  I would say to give it a try.",0

April 3  2015By MGH,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,If you're concerned about fit and comfort more than price these are NOT the scrubs to buy.  The top fits slightly large around the bust and under the arms and snug around the abdomen and waist.  I tried two sizes the XL and the 2XL- the 2XL was way too big throughout the entire top and the XL provides too snug a fit for my comfort.  I want scrubs that provide a professional looking fit not baggy and sloppy.  While lightweight the material does not seem to breathe so if you're working in a warm building and doing  a lot of walking etc. you get hot fast.  I've washed the top 4 or 5 times and the material is still somewhat stiff.  Overall not a great product.,0

With everything.* They need almost no ironing.  If you time it right and hang them up straight out of the dryer (before it's finished the cycle -- when they're not yet 100% dry) they require no ironing at all.* They last forever.  Roll around on the concrete; play in the dirt; brush elbows with bigwigs -- these shirts will survive.Cons:* They run about 3/4 size big.  If you like baggier clothes order your size.  If you like more form-fitting shirts order a size smaller.* They don't make you coffee in the morning and drive you to work.  Dickies if you're listening please work this into the design.Buy one of every color and you won't need another shirt for 5 years.  Seriously.,0

March 12  2013By Hal Shaker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Welcome to the club.  If you’re the sort of MAN that mows his own lawn would rescue children from a burning orphanage then change the oil on a car truck or train; then this is the shirt for you.Dickies are some of the longest and hardest wearing shirts in the history of MEN.  The design allows one the wear them tucked in or hanging out.  Long sleeves can be rolled up and you’ve got a delightful summer ensemble to carry you through the year; just the way I like it.  There are also two pockets count them two which hold manly man things like chuck keys fishing lures and bacon.With more than a dozen colors who’s to say these aren’t equally fashionable?  With so many choices you can have a shirt to match your mood.  Silver when the Raiders play at home Hunter Green for hunting and Red as a display of rage over the senseless removal of Caterpillar engines from the pickup truck market.  There truly is a color for every occasion.Washing is idiot proof since I can do it.  Put it in the machine and wash no pre-rinse or delicate cycles just get the washer started and you did good.  Then you can dry by hanging it up using the dryer or leaving it in the machine for an extra day cuz it will come out fresh and wrinkle free.If you’re seeking the ultimate work shirt it really is hard to do better than Dickies.  Having them delivered to my doorstep and avoiding a soul depleting trip to a mall makes it a done deal.,0

Uniforms Work & Safety,B000N8Q57Q,Dickies Men's Long-Sleeve Work…, Wears Like A Work Shirt  October 24  2016By RP MeggsVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I read lots of reviews on this shirt before buying it and my issue was trying to figure out which size I wanted. Looking at the size chart the L size neck measurement was too small with the chest size right and the XL had the right neck size but the chest was too large so I went with the XL and am pleased with the way it fits. I am five feet ten inches tall at 190 pounds and rather muscular so I think I could have gotten into a large but it would have been a bit too restrictive.I would say to get the size you would normally do with a T shirt. If you wear a size L T shirt get the size L Dickies shirt and so on. A couple of things I noted about this design is first some descriptions show that there is a company logo on a pocket and the bottom of the shirt but with mine there is no tag on the pocket on this one.I saw one review that said the shirt was so stiff it would stand up by itself and showed a picture of that. Okay yeah it will do that but only if you leave all of the cardboard liners inside the shirt. Otherwise I can assure you it is not that stiff and will not do that. And I read some complaining about the fabric being too rough causing a rash etc. It's a work shirt! If you have ever worn a work shirt it feels like that. The fabric doesn't feel or wear the same as a lighter gauge dress shirt. Just wash it before you wear it the first time and you should be okay. But it's always going to feel like you're wearing a work shirt.I am glad that I bought this shirt. It goes perfect with my pants from the same manufacturer. It's a good buy for the money and I plan on getting some more in different colors.,0

Color  matches  picture  – I purchased the hunter green for my husband and  it looks  great!

I didn't even know  he had washed it twice because it looked  straight out of  the package – perfect  for a man who  doesn't iron  and doesn't usually remove shirts  immediately  from the dryer!

Uniforms Work & Safety,B000N8Q57Q,Dickies Men's Long-Sleeve Work…, Dick\ies Work Shirts vs Carhartt Work Shirts  July 8  2014By Matthew ParkVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have a few workshirts that I've bought from Carhartt but they were all a bit too thick for summer wear. I like to wear a shirt unbuttoned with sleeves rolled up with a t-shirt underneath but the Carhartt shirts are all a bit too thick for summer. Due to this I decided to give these Dickies shirts a try. I'm glad I did. Since this was my first time buying these shirts I bought 1 in the dark navy color and the color is accurate to the one displayed in the picture.Price: 5/5The price is extremely accurate to the quality. $20 for this shirt seems like a steal. With a price like that I can get a variety of colors without putting as big of a hole in my wallet.Quality: 4/5For the price I can't complain. They are lower than quality than Carhartt shirts but you get what you pay for. Although it is lower in quality than the Carhartt shirts they seem very sturdy and seem like they will last a while. When I opened it there were a few tattered strings hanging loose but no big deal just cut em' off. The stitching quality is not amazing but enough to keep this shirt together for what looks like a long time to come.Looks: 5/5These have a bit of shine to them. Carhartt shirts have a bit of a matte type reflection but these have a slight gleam cause of the polyester mix in the cotton. These are awesome for doing work and just wearing as a dress shirt. Sturdy AND fashionable.Comfortability: 4/5These are a bit ""scratchy"" as compared to the Carhartt shirts. Carhartt shirts are extremely comfortable but these are a little rough but that's not a biggy on me. It feels much thinner than a Carhartt shirt but a tad bit more heftier than a dress shirt.Fit: TRUE to sizeI'm on the slim size. For reference I wear small (sometimes medium) t-shirts. I ordered a small and it fit me great. Not baggy not tight a little room which is what I was looking for. Compared to a Carhartt they don't run big like the Carhartts do Carhartts are a little baggy on me which is fine for the winter.Function: 5/5These are extremely sturdy for the price and don't look like they will fall apart anytime soon. I'm not gonna say they're waterproof but they seem somewhat water-resistant as water tends to bead up on it.Overall I'm very happy with my first purchase of these shirts and will definitely add more colors to my work shirts wordrobe. I would definitely recommend at least giving these shirts a try.",0

I highly recommend them!  March 1  2015By ZapNZs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have been using these Hanes socks for about two years now and this is my third order. I am very happy with these. These socks are affordable comfortable durable and cut to a size that fits very closely to as-expected.The primary material of these socks are cotton but they also use polyester. The material used is flexible and capable of being stretched without permanently deforming. The padding of these socks are excellent. They give you very good comfort but they also do not make your feet sweat like crazy. An extra durable toe and heavy stitching give you good durability even if you are harder on socks. In fact these hold up just as well as some of the socks I have owned in the past that were over twice the price!!!As other Reviewers have noted like most 'no show' socks they still show with lower cut shoes. This isn't something that bothers me but it is important to note that if you want extremely low fitting socks that do not show at all with lower-cut shoes this may not be the product for you. If that is not a concern then you should be pretty happy with fitment. The 10-13 size is cut so that it is right in the middle of what that size should be so if you know you need a 10-13 or a 6-12 size sock you won't have to worry about fitment ""surprises"" when these arrive.After the first wash the black colors do NOT bleed easily and these socks are not picky at all when it comes to wash/dry cycles.Overall these Hanes socks are a very good product. Very good performance very good durability and excellent value. I highly recommend!",1

December 2  2016By Mister AmazonVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Honestly I have never imagined in my wildest dreams I would be spending a Friday night writing a review for socks from Hane's no less. But here we are 20 years removed from being a 10 year old. Most teachers ask their students what do you imagine yourself doing as an adult. Well I don't have the dream job or the life I want but my god these socks are pretty good.I took a chance with these socks after wearing some pairs from a different company for the past year.Now I tend to purchase from Hane's but the quality has been declining for past few years. After a few months of usage these socks have held up pretty well. I mainly wear these with size 13 low fashion sneakers or even sneakers with mid tops. So you can imagine I have pretty decent size hobbit feet. The socks have been comfortable and usually stay in place. There have been a few occasions where the sock will ride under the back of the heel but it is due from me not adjusting my sneakers correctly or wearing an irregular size shoe for my feet.,0

Ever since I have bought these socks I wear these much more often just because how comfortable and well-circulated my feet feel compared to my other socks.In comparison to my other ""athletic"" socks these socks blow them out of them water in terms of how comfortable they are. I do not own any of those socks that cost $15 per pair but compared to the standard athletic sock these are amazing.I bought these about a month ago so I am not sure how durable these socks are.

November 30  2016By AceLux91Verified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,These are super comfortable! They're thicker than other Hanes socks I've bought before so they're perfect for when it gets colder but you don't want to wear taller/longer socks. I've bought two packs and so far they're washing well and are durable.The cut is perfect too and for me they're below my ankle which means for most of my shoes they don't show (they show just a slight on Chuck Taylor/Converse but compared to most 'No Show' socks these are the closest to actually not showing; except if you're comparing to shoe liners/boat shoe socks or those new types of no show socks with a new cut that covers half your foot (by Converse Vans etc) which are good too but usually are expensive),0

The first order was very comfortable.  So I ordered more!  The second order was completely different with far inferior material.  I mentioned this to the seller and they stated they would refund the order if I returned it.  But this doesn't fix the problem -- I ordered something didn't receive it now must do more work to ship it back to then search for the actual product and hope it works the second time.  Thus I told them it wasn't worth my effort.  They then offered 15% off.  But I didn't bother accepting this ... what I actually want -- is the product I ordered.  I don't want money.  I want comfortable socks.  I would love to order these again but have no confidence that the proper product will be shipped.  I thought through direct conversation the issue could be found and fixed after all people make mistakes and they are fixed all the time.  But they focused on trying to make me happy with money rather than making me happy with the correct product.  At least they tried though which was appreciated.,0

I had to order a white warm up and got this and I have to say I like the zipper better in this style more convenient. Now onto the fit..The fit reviews are most important to me since I'm buying online. I don't care about thread counts or looking ""stylish"" because this is medical profession attire NOT for a fashion show. These are not the most beautiful jackets in the world but very comfortable. Anyway I have bought cherokee because I find it to fit me the best. I have a small chest and a big butt & hips most reviews don't talk about the fit of this area. When you buy online you need this info.What I have found with Cherokee scrub tops is they are small in the chest area this works for me but may not for others. Most likely if you are a C Cup or above it may be uncomfortable. But with this jacket it's actually big but the butt/hip area is small for me. So I ordered a size up from my normal size medium cherokee fit. I ordered a large in this and I'm glad I did because the lower band on it is snug on my hips/butt. It is rather boxy up top because I don't fill it but I am ok with it.So if you have hips/butt order a size up because it probably won't fit if you order your normal top size. I am 5'3 and the length of this covers half of my butt snugly.Hope this helps others with the ""booty"" struggle!!",0

The clinics I'm in are freezing and it's frustrating having to wear a long sleeve shirt in 90 degree weather because the building will be cold. I wanted a scrub jacket that was warm but also easy to move around in. Buttons/snaps are clumsy and not easy to do when you are in a hurry so when I saw Cherokee made a jacket that had a zipper I was sold. I ordered this jacket in the same size I wear my Core Stretch tops and it fits greats. It is super comfy lightweight easy to move around in and warm. My hands are always freezing so I constantly have my hands in the pockets. When zipped it fits snug (which is good when you are cold) but my hands can't be comfortably placed in the pockets. Easy solution: when hands are cold jacket is unzipped. When my body is cold and I need to use my hands jacket is zipped. The cuffs do pill a little bit but it doesn't bother me. I'm 5'10 ordered a medium and the sleeves are the perfect length for my long arms. I even have enough material to stretch the sleeves over my hands. I would definitely recommend this jacket!,0

I love the fit and feel of this jacket. It's a sateen-like cotton that's very soft and stretchy. The style is slimmer and much better than most boxy lab coats. I have long arms and usually have a hard time finding jackets with sleeves that fit. The sleeves are the perfect length for me but may be pretty long for others. The cuffs on the sleeves make it easy to roll up. The only thing I would note is that I had a hard time ironing out the creases when it first arrived. It is 55% cotton so after washing/drying you definitely have to remove immediately to prevent it from wrinkling. I'm 5'5 125 lbs and bought an XS.,0

At first I had trouble with the cloud setup when setting it up for the first time....very annoying and I ended up pressing the power button after being stuck on an advertisement screen for cloud storage. Luckly  it fixed itself and resumed setup normally. Since then no trouble's. Some things I don't like is the material surrounding the touchpad and keyboard. It shows oil marks from hands and absorbs it a bit. Though it does clean up and feels good it's just a sub par material if your a clean freak. The keypad has a soft mushy spot in the middle which I don't really like but has caused no problems. I also don't care too much for the touch pad although it gets the job done. Just the one piece design some times does not do what you want. Have to take extra care of finger placement. That's about it for the bad stuff Now the good. Computer is pretty fast at loading content if your on a 5ghz signal at least. The screen has very good color and is capable of playing upscaled 4k video (screen is 1080 p) at ""decent"" frame rates it seems which looks great. Best screen I've ever hard the pleasure of viewing though there is better i'am sure but probably not at this price. I love the backlit keyboard !! Manufacturers should of been doing this a long time ago ! I have also gamed on it a little bit. This computer can handle most of the last gen console games like left for dead half life call of duty mw3 and world at war on good settings. As far as online not sure but some bench marks showed games like battlefield 3/4 would really strain it with 64 players but something like call of duty mw3 should run decent. Having a dedicated graphics card in a laptop will cost ya a couple hundred more than this so keep that in mind.  For the 400 to 500 dollar range this computer cannot be beat as of right now from my research. It's chuck full of feature's like facial recognition camera to sign in instead of a password backlit key board touch screen hd screen A 6200u processor which is plenty strong for multi tasking and video 8 gigs of ram and one terabyte hard drive which is way more than enough for most people.",0

Brown,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I normally do not need to do a review on items that I have purchased on Amazon and although I do not purchase computers on Amazon I did in this case as one of my grandson's needed a new computer and since he is a young teen I did not want to invest in something super expensive just in case as kids will be kids.So once I received the system I unpackaged it and charged the battery and while that was taking place I went out on the Dell website to look up documentation such as user and service manuals which I generally do with all my computers.  I also checked on a replacement battery just for the fun of it and got an unexpected comment from Dell indicating that Dell replacement batteries are not available for this model as it is a ""DISCONTINUED"" product which was quite surprising as the Amazon description indicates it is a 2017 Newest Dell Inspiron which apparently is not the case so buyer beware.If you looks closely at the Dell shipping box you will find that there is a new sticker placed over the system description showing it as advertised although looking closer you find that the system was manufactured in the 2015/16 time frame so again beware.Putting everything above aside and from other reviews it apparently is a pretty good system especially with a touch screen although in our case it was not really needed but nice just the same.  The real acid test is once it is up and running he will run it pretty good and we should within the next week determine if it's a pig or performs fairly well He does play games even Minecraft and although this system was not bought to be a game machine we are hoping that he will be a able to see somewhat of a difference since he is coming from a 4 year old Toshiba I-3 standard machine going to an I-5 so there should be a little bit of a performance enhancement.The only real message is that this is a discontinued system so folks just need to be aware. based around the description on Amazon",0

Laptops,B01K1IO3QW,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM…,        857 of 876 people found the following review helpful       There is NO BETTER VALUE in laptops....Period!! I stake my 20 hours of research on it! ACER killed it with this one!  December 9  2016By Honest,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Let me paint a picture:My background is in purchasing I am a research nerd. I used to spend in excess of 50 million a year for the largest retailer of its kind in my industry I am obsessive when comparing details and am even more obsessed with getting every last ounce of value for my money. I am not the most tech savvy person you will ever meet but I believe I am above average and I also believe I am a realistic person with regards to my expectations. This is a fantastic laptop for the majority of people I do not intend to do heavy gaming or run heavy/complex programs. This laptop is like the F-150 of laptops (sorry Chevy fans)  yes some people need an F-250 or even F-350 for towing/hauling but for most people an F-150 is all they will ever need.With that said I spent about 20 working hours comparing over 400 laptops (nerd) from all major brands and looked at over 300 deals(super nerd) offered on laptops by all major retailers on both black friday and cyber monday. I chose this laptop for $329 on cyber monday and although it was only $20 off versus others that were $200 or more off this was still the most computer for the money.Here is why to buy this laptop:1)  Newest Kaby Lake generation 7 Intel processor low 15 watt usage and great speed for the price. Runs quiet and cool.2)  DDR4 ram again the latest and greatest also happens to be the cheapest ram available. Ram prices have an inverse relationship to normal consumer priced goods. Most things cost more when new but because PC components become obsolete so quickly when ram is first introduced this is the product being currently manufactured which in turn means supply can easily exceed demand which means lower prices. Once ram is no longer being actively manufactured the supply dries up and prices increase. Also ram can EASILY be added to this laptop takes less than 5 minutes and costs exactly $24.99 for the best available here is the link to the 4GB stick I added: https://www.amazon.com/Ballistix-16GBx2-PC4-19200-SODIMM-260-Pin/dp/B01DGOF6GE?th=1 ***Additional note about ram I chose to purchase an additional stick of 4gb rather than a 8gb or 16gb.  There is a phenomenon known as ""dual channel"" with regards to ram the concept is that if you have 2 like sticks of ram (they need to match in a few tech specs) in the exact same size ie: 2 sticks of 4gb of ram your pc will be able to access both sticks of ram at the same time. If you have 2 mismatched sticks like a 4gb and an 8gb then the pc will access only 1 at a time. Therefore after talking to a computer genius friend of mine and doing about an hours research on this specific application my best guess is that the extra money on the 8gb stick of ram would be a waste two 4gb sticks of dual channel ram will out perform a 4gb and 8gb stick together for most applications. Also please note that for 99% of users 8gb of ram total is plenty. My personal opinion of adding more than 8gb of ram to this specific laptop would be like putting the most expensive Z rated tires on your honda accord yes the tires might be rated for 200mph but will you ever utilize it? If you do want to have more than 8gb of ram total I would recommend purchasing 2 identical sticks of 8gb or 16gb ram to utilize dual channel.3)  Full 1080 HD LED back lit (vs LCD) Screen pretty much unheard of for this price. LED backlit biggest advantage is it uses less energy thus better battery life.  Also has a matte finish screen I prefer the look of a glossy screen (good for a desktop in a controlled lighting environment) but because laptops travel with you to different places you often times have reflection problems with a glossy screen.4)  Battery life best battery life you can get for anywhere close to 3x the cost of this pc. Please know that 12 hours is in best case scenario meaning lowest screen brightness and NOT playing videos or games or other CPU intensive tasks. Based on my first week of use I feel comfortable planning on a solid 7 to 10 hours of normal use. Please note that the battery is not easily removed as one reviewer put ""let your future self worry about that"". ****Note on battery ACER has a specific process for breaking in your battery. If you do not follow it you WILL limit its potential. If you are too lazy to find the manual online here is my summary of what they say: Charge laptop to full (charge light turns to blue) before you ever turn it on. Then leave the laptop plugged in while the computer updates it will not update and boot up the first time without being plugged in. As soon as updates are completed unplug the laptop and use the PC until the battery is almost dead. Then charge it to full and immediately unplug and discharge to near empty. Do this cycle a total of 3 times to condition your battery for its best longevity.5) Back LIT keyboard there is no other laptop back of $800 that offers a backlit keyboard that I could find. This means the keys light up when one is pushed you will absolutely love this feature if you have never had it. Also the keys are crisp but very easy to use I love them.6) Easily upgrade-able. I will briefly touch on this because other reviews have done a fine job of addressing it. Basically to turn this PC from great to ridiculously amazing do 2 things. The first is add ram (although mine operated for almost a week very well on the stock 4GB). The second is add a SSD or Solid State Hard Drive. To make a long story short the motherboard for this PC has 2 spots for a hard drive the SATA and the m.2. The 1TB stock hard drive is installed on the sata slot. That means the m.2 slot is open. You can either purchase a traditional sata SSD and replace the existing hard drive or purchase a m.2 SSD and have 2 hard drives. The latter is the option I chose I am placing the operating system and programs on the SSD because it is much quicker and I will place files (Photos games music movies) on the stock drive. ***If you decide to pull the stock hard drive you can purchase a usb case for it and turn it into an external hard drive that connects via usb cable.7) Newest AC wifi technology for fastest speeds8) All the other tech stuff you want like usb 3 hdmi CD RW drive blah blah blah.9) Fit and finish is excellent. Speakers are also stupid good for this price range.Reason's to not buy:1) You need more of a workhorse PC2) You print money in your basement and don't care about value3) You don't like Henry Fords philosophy of ""you can have any color you like as long as it is black"" because this PC only comes in the 1 color.Conclusion: Sometimes and much more rarely than you would think a manufacturer actually listens to customers and gives them everything they want at a great price.  This laptop is a unicorn in the fact that it has ALL SOLID FEATURES with 2 potentially weak spots for some users (ram and hard drive). But these are easily upgraded and the truth is (regardless of what tech nerds might argue) 4gb of ram and the included hard drive are more than adequate for the majority of users. The only real question you have to ask yourself is do you have the patience to wait or will you pony up for 1 day shipping?",0

October 26  2016By Amazon-er,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is a great all around laptop if you are trying to find something in the budget range under $350.At the time of this review there are no i3 7th gen 2.4GHz laptops that offer 1TB hard drives 32GB max memory or 1920 x 1080 screens. Other things that I found on this model that are not on similarly priced units are RJ-45 ports (most units are wireless only) Dual-Band 2.4GHz & 5GHz wi-fi capable or have backlit keyboards.Few models in this price range have built in optical drives 3.1 USB port SD reader or battery life claims of up to 12hrs like this Acer  E575 Sig Ed laptop.The computer does have a plastic feel to it but no stranger than the plastic feel of an LG4 or Samsung Galaxy phone. Carrying the laptop it feels sleek and solid. Accessing the RAM or HD is as simple as unscrewing a panel under the laptop.Honestly I do not know how the computer runs with 4GB RAM because I bought a 16GB stick of RAM and now have 20GB. That and the usual ""How Can I make Windows 10 run faster"" tweaks make this laptop very responsive and meet my daughter's personal and academic needs.The last laptop I bought her was in 2006 an HP HDX-18t CoreDuo 1.8GHZ Vista laptop. It lasted 10 years up to her senior year in HS and just died.  It cost about 3x more had 2hrs battery life and weighed 6+lbs. With college coming next fall I needed something to meet her needs and my budget. Her current uses for this laptop are web surfing Netflix/Youtube binge watching Internet Radio Skyping heavy Excel sheets (+50 pages & calculations or more) Matlab SPSS Statistics 20 for Windows.Although this is a budget laptop it does not stick out in appearance or performance when she's studying with friends that have expensive Apple laptops or higher end notebooks. It isn't a gaming laptop but she does run BlueStacks to play some Android games.You've got to be crazy to pass on this laptop if the main selling point for you is having 1yr MS Office or not like I have read in other reviews. Libre Office is free and the hardware is a good value. Maybe later this year or next year (it's Oct 2016) competitors will come out with more comparative offerings but if you need a notebook >now<  this is your best bet.Two criticisms my daughter does have about this model is 1) the palm rest (area below the keyboard) attracts fingerprints and is showing some wear. Would be nice it it were textured like the exterior of the laptop.2) If the RJ-45 port cover could flex retract or hinge more. It's a very tight fit and feels like the port cover will snap in two every time it is pushed down.Hope this review helps people who don't have much to spend thanks Acer for putting good value in the market!",1
Laptops,B01K1IO3QW,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM…,        101 of 105 people found the following review helpful       So far so good.  A lot of laptop for the price  but some technical quirks mean you need to research it a bit first.  January 5  2017By Johnboy69,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is just  ""First Impressions"" review as I just got the laptop yesterday.  That said I will speak at length about the value of this computer.As with any new Windows 10 installation the Acer required quite a bit of time before it was ready for use.  After answering a few questions (pay special attention to the security and privacy options) I had to wait for a slew of updates.  While not unexpected during this process the laptop was essentially unusable.  After many updates and about six restarts over the course of a couple hours it was good to go.One of the first things I noticed about the way it ran was the fact that was at or near 100% HD utilization much of the time.  That means it was constantly accessing the HD.  This by the way was after the updates were done.  Part of this was due to Windows indexing the drive part was due to the fact that Windows 10 isn't always great at dynamically creating the Virtual RAM swap space.  After I changed it (4096 minimum 8192 maximum) in the Advanced System Settings it started working quite smoothly.  I've ordered another stick of RAM to double what it already has so that will also help.While waiting for the updates I checked it out physically.  The screen at the very top edge has a seam between the front and back panel.  That seam is almost big enough to get a fingernail in there and it's sharp enough to scrape me when I run my hand across it.  That's a bit concerning but not at all different from my last mid-price laptop (an HP DV6 from about four years ago).  It speaks to the fit and finish of the unit though and I'm concerned that it will eventually turn from a seam into a gap.  The last thing I want to have to do is tape my new laptop.Also I noticed the USB port on the right side of the unit will shock me if I touch it.  That's an issue I've seen on phones and laptops before.  Often this is due to a short but sometimes it's just the way the port was designed.  I don't like that and will be examining it further.The trackpad is one of those that doesn't have separate buttons but instead allows you to push it in to ""left click"".  It also has the areas on the bottom of the trackpad for left-button and right-button operations.  While it works quite well I prefer having separate buttons.  Of course I knew by the pictures that this would be the case so it's not a surprise.The keyboard is fine.  It's backlit in a way but the backlighting seems a little bit like an afterthought.  The backlighting does time-out if you're not using the keyboard for a minute or so.  Be prepared for that as the backlight will come back on the moment you start typing again.While I planned on installing an SSD in the M.2 slot I noticed that (like others) the slot didn't come with a standoff and a screw to hold the SSD drive in place.  There is a little plastic cover over the chip that's underneath the slot and the screw-holes are present in the motherboard so it's likely that the motherboard manufacturer anticipated the slot to be used.  That said without the screw and the standoff Acer seems to be saying they'd rather not have us use it.  Once I can find the screw type (looks like an M2.5x4mm with a .45mm pitch) I'll likely grab what I need and order an SSD.The memory is according to Acer's own comments supposed to be a DDR4 2133.  It's not.  It's a Kingston DDR4 2400.  As such if I were you and I were thinking about adding another stick I'd wait until I saw the memory it came with.  It's really easy to see - it's printed on a sticker on the RAM.  If you're not sure how to check it jump on YouTube - there are a few videos showing people installing additional RAM.  Why is this important?  When adding RAM while it's not necessary to get the same size and speed of RAM it's actually really helpful.  Two 4GB sticks of the same type will function more efficiently than one 8GB stick due to the multichannel nature of the chipset.  That only works if both sticks are functionally the same.  Yes that includes speed.  No that doesn't mean you have to get the same brand.This leads me to my last point:  Be aware of ""cost creep"".  If you buy this at $349 spend another $24 on RAM and spend $79 on a 240MB SSD drive you might be teetering close to the next level of laptop.  Acer has a similar model with a seventh-gen i5-7200u 8GB and a 256GB SSD for $549 right now.  That's $200 more with a faster CPU the same 8GB you want the same SSD you want and it also comes with a moderately better GPU for games (NVidia 940MX).  Compare that at $549 (or its competition) vs this one at $452.  The difference isn't so big is it?  Yes this one would still have the 1 TB 2.5"" HD in it so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison but it's something you might want to consider.One more thing before I forget:  The battery is not removable.  You'd have to crack open the case and likely void the warranty to remove it.Even with all that if you're looking for a laptop that's short on price and long on features this is likely a smart pick.  The adage of ""You get what you pay for"" still applies but we're now getting a lot more than ever before for this price.",0

November 18  2016By Stephen Van Vuuren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This model (1TB HD 4GB RAM) is the best buy in low budget laptops for many reasons. I was prepared to return it but it's exceeded my expectations. First it has features almost never found in even sub $800 unit much less $329 - backlight keyboard 1920 x 1080 display and upgradable/replaceable storage. For those reasons alone it's a 5 star machine.It has a M2 slot accessible without violating warranty on bottom. I ordered it with $70 Crucial 275GB M2 SSD and additional 4GB RAM ($29) from Kingston (what it came with). So now for $429 I have a 15"" Kaby Lake I3 with 8GB RAM 256GB SSD and 1TB second drive with backlit keys and Full 1080p display and HD 620 Intel Graphics - better for video playback than 520. I could not find something close to this used much less new.And the other aspects are good as well. Keyboard is comfortable number keybad is nice for my work backlit works well (if on/off proximity function does not bug you it does not me). Trackpad works better than I expected.Screen is a TN panel (1080P IPS would probably double the price). So viewing angles are not great and contrast is just okay. But for single person use it's good by budget panel features with better than expected color accuracy and a blue light filter that reduces strain.The chassis has a nice faux brushed metal look and more rigid than most sub $400 plastic models. Weight is so so - not heavy not light for a 15.6"". Sound from speakers was also better than I expected in this price range.Bloatware on my model was minimal. BIOS is bare bones but easily accessible to change boot drive etc. And you get full ports without ultrabook dongles. And with my upgrades model posted a 2900 Single Core Geekbench and 5800 multicore. Again very good for a machine in this price range.I've had it for a week - will update long term use - but right now it's a winner. For the money you can't find a better deal on a 15.6"" HD with backlit.EDIT. Update. Everything is worked as stated above - nothing has changed. Battery life is impressive even with adding RAM and SSD. The only real quibbles is backlight timing is annoying and viewing angles are not ideal (not a great group laptop). But considering nothing at this prices even has backlight or 1080p screens you would need to move to $500 or more model to improve. I would buy this again at the price without hesitation.",0
Laptops,B01K1IO3QW,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM…,        25 of 26 people found the following review helpful       A Rockin PC for Work and Gaming that will Make Your Wallet Sing  January 6  2017By Benjamin Skinner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Let me just start by saying this Acer is a rock solid computer with a lot to offer. It’s an excellent value and it’s nearly impossible to find another computer with the same specs for around the same price no matter where you look. The screen is beautiful the keyboard is comfortable and all the added features are exciting to say the least.Typing and Work PerformanceI picked this Acer up to use in a professional capacity for marketing writing and programming. I type more than 10000 words on it every day and it works phenomenally well for that purpose. I threw in a subscription to Microsoft Office 365 and this baby is perfect for word processing tasks. The keyboard is smooth and responsive and the backlit keyboard makes working at night easier than ever.I’m a touch typist with a very high typing speed and I never experience any input lag or other issues that I’ve experienced with my little Acer Chromebook in the past.The same day that I ordered this machine I also picked up an added 4GB stick of RAM. I went with the Crucial 2133 stick of RAM and it works fine though I would have went with a 2400 had I known that that was what’s in the system.--Battery Life--The battery life on this computer is so good that I needed a separate category for it. No you probably won’t get 12 hours of battery life out of the machine I certainly don’t. But I do get between 9 and 6 hours of battery power depending on what I’m doing. Sure gaming will kill it faster but if I’m doing standard stuff it’s pretty common for me to get about 8 hours or enough life to do nearly a full day of work without charging it.--Gaming--Plenty of people say that this computer isn’t for gaming and they’re absolutely right. I had an order placed for a powerful Alienware computer at nearly $1600 and that beast was a gaming PC but that beast also offered  around 2 hours of battery life at the best of times according to user reviews. I was all ready to receive the order and it never came in. Instead of working out the issue with Dell I simply canceled the order and snagged this computer on a whim and I couldn’t be happier!Sure it won’t run high intensity games at high or ultra settings but I’ve never cared about that. This laptop runs most of the games that I like to play (Rocket League Terraria Minecraft Counterstrike World of Tanks the Sims 4 Overwatch Heroes of the Storm World of Warcraft) and it handles most of them on medium settings.Not only can I enjoy my favorite games on this machine but I end up getting around 2 to 3 hours of gaming battery life with it and there isn’t any lag issues as long as I set it to high performance in the battery settings.--Watching Videos--Out of all the laptops I’ve owned in the past this one has the nicest screen by far. It was the 1080p screen that drew me in above everything else because I needed space to have multiple windows open at the same time.This screen is clear and vibrant I don’t know if it has perfect color representation but it’s super bright and it’s clearly high definition. My wife was amazed at the clarity of the screen when watching a video with me last night and she’s used to a pretty decent Macbook Air screen on a system that’s close to 3 times the price of this.If you’ve read through some other reviews you probably already know that this is a good value. I just want to reconfirm this and say that as long as you aren’t looking for a super powerful gaming machine this laptop is likely all that you need. I’m thrilled with its performance and would have a hard time upgrading to a more powerful system because I love the long battery life that this one offers.,1
Laptops,B01K1IO3QW,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM…,        14 of 14 people found the following review helpful       Perfect for med school  February 3  2017By Stevo Suave,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I don't frequently write reviews but I have found this laptop to check every single wish box I have for laptops. I am a med student and I think that this is the perfect setup for my needs.Comfortable typing keyboard.Backlit keyboard.MATTE screen. This is critical because I spend all day in a classroom under ridiculous fluourescent lights. It is seriously a game changer and was very high on my list of needs in a laptop.DDR4 RAM 4gb as ONE stick with one empty slotm.2 SATA slot (open) - mine included the necessary mounting screw.Very light compared to my old laptop.1080p screen that is not a touchscreen (I avoid them because they decrease battery life even when not in use)Number pad.Latest generation i3 processor. This is nice for future-proofing and you absolutely do not need more than an i3 if you use it for basic student stuff.Textured exterior case for the laptop does not show fingerprints too badly.EXTREMELY LONG BATTERY LIFE! This is not something that the manufacturer has exaggerated. If I turn the screen down turn off the backlit keyboard turn off wifi and only do light word processing then I can get 19+ hours out of the battery. With normal use including word processing powerpoint web surfing light youtube watching I get over 12 hours of use. So the 12 hours of battery life claim is not just for bare bones use it applies to normal student use. Currently I am at 22% battery remaining with 3 hours and 14 minutes left. I only need to charge this thing every other day or so despite having it on all day in class.Recommended upgrade: I strongly recommend that you either install an m.2 SSD and migrate the OS to it or replace the HDD with an SSD. Installation is very easy with 3 screws for removing the bottom plate. There is an included mounting apparatus for the 2.5"" drive. I also decided to add an additional stick of 4gb DDR4 RAM also very easy to install right next to the hard drive. With those two small changes this laptop absolutely flies and never gets bogged down when I have tons of chrome windows powerpoints emails and study guides open all at once. Boot time is just a few seconds.CONS:So the touchpad isn't my favorite. It is not textured which would have been better. My fingers tend to get bogged down and not slide smoothly across its surface. This is something I have grown accustomed to and now do not notice as much.The inside surface of the laptop is a fingerprint magnet.Overall for the price I would say this is the absolute best laptop for a student. I spent a ton of time researching laptops so take my word for it and get this one.",0

This Core i3 version with regular 1TB HDD ...  November 28  2016By ANC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"We've purchased many of the Core i5 version of this laptop with SSD & nVidia graphics for our customers and they are very happy. This Core i3 version with regular 1TB HDD & Intel graphics has the same build quality as the higher performance versions but at a substantially lower price. If you don't need quad cores or discrete graphics but want the fast boot times of an SSD you can buy a regular 2.5"" SSD and replace the mechanical drive OR you can buy an M.2 SATA III SSD (Not NVMe compatible) and have two drives one for fast boot and programs the other for file storage & backup. I recommend the Crucial MX300 www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IAGSDJ0. Also apparently they are shipping these laptops WITH the M.2 mounting screw (see attached photos) so you don't have to purchase or jury rig anything! (Careful installing the M.2 SSD as it plugs in only one way)",1
Laptops,B01K1IO3QW,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575-33BM…,        57 of 63 people found the following review helpful       Coolio - if you know what you're doing  December 4  2016By Wanos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This system is excellent for those who just need a reasonable system without having to pay an arm and a leg for it.  Although  it can be kind of slow.  Be aware this is NOT a super duper gaming laptop.  If it was it would have a dedicated video card and an i5 at least.  So kwit yer beechn'.  It's even better for advanced users such as myself.  Why?  Because us advanced users like to upgrade the system.  Unlike prior versions of Acer Aspire laptops where you have to take the entire bottom cover off safely and slowly disconnect a dozen cables and then remove a bunch of random parts just so you can get to replacing the RAM or hard drive this system allows you to easily unscrew 3 screws and pop out the bottom to replace the hard drive for a faster 7200 RPM one add an M.2 SSD or upgrade the RAM.Note that it'll play 4K (2160p) YouTube videos kinda choppy because the wireless NIC is just not able to stream quick enough.  If you insert a regular Ethernet cable it'll work a little better but it'll play 1080p and 1440p just fine.Quick Summary of PROS:-Upgradeable.  Extremely easy to upgrade to an SSD replace the hard drive upgrade RAM etc.-Backlit keyboard is nice and only comes on when you touch the keys.  It turns itself off soon after inactivity to conserve battery.  Feels nice too and is quiet.-Battery lasts a long time if you turn down display (can go for about 8 hours as per estimation from battery popup - which I've found accurate - haven't reached 12 hours yet... I suspect 12 hours mean you put it on the lowest brightness setting turn off just about everything including lowering performance on the built in GPU and just staring at the screen or something).-I haven't touched the laptop for a week and after turning it back on the battery is at 100%.  The battery drainage is extremely minimal.  I've noticed a similar thing with a 4th gen i3 Acer laptop I own too.  Not so for my MSI gaming laptop though.  After 1 week 100% charge goes to like 15%.-The outer ""metal cut"" matte finish is awesome.  Completely fingerprint-proof.  This is how ALL laptops should be.  It's beautiful too.-USB 3.0 (Crystal Mark on my SanDisk Extrreme SD card capable of 95MB/s read/write confirms the USB port can mostly reach these speeds 95.7 MB/s read / 85 MB/s write with the SD card) using a Transcend USB 3.0 to SD reader.  My desktop computer does 95 MB reads and 93 MB writes.  My SanDisk Extreme PRO USB 128GB flash drive (rated at 260 MB/s read/write) does 263.4 MB/s sustained reads and 244.8 MB/s writes.-1080p.-This is the only laptop I found that has a backlit keyboard 1080p and battery lasts a long time and in this price range.Quick Summary of CONS:-I wish the inner finish would be more like the outer.  The inner is typical black a fingerprint magnet etc.  Maybe I'll buy some sort of armorskin (the type meant to protect phone screens) for it or something to prevent the annoying fingerprint smears.-The SD card reader is not that fast and appears to run at USB 2.0 speeds.  The same SD card noted above only did 22.83 MB/s read and 22.18 MB/s writes.-USB 3.0 slots are close to each other.  Large devices will not fit side by side.-BIOS isn't configurable much like a gaming laptop but that's expected.-No dedicated GPU for gaming but I already knew that before purchasing.  Light gaming should be OK.-Not an i5 but a 7th generation i3 is as fast as older generation i5's.-I use the only USB 2.0 slot for my wireless mouse.  Wish it had a second one to use for a wireless keyboard too.-Hard to remove battery in case it freezes.  Pressing and holding the power button down for a few seconds might come in handy to ""force"" shutdown the system in such cases.  FYI.-I just noticed right now the touchpad is sticking out/up on one side.  That can't be good.  See image I posted.UPDATE:  12/27/16  - I realize now why the touchpad is sticking up.  It's due to using the laptop screw to hold down the m.2 SSD.  I purchased shorter screws and now this is no longer a problem.  DOH!OTHER THOUGHTS:-Amazon did not package the device properly.  They only threw in some brown paper instead of air bubble bags.  The Acer box was flying around inside the outer shipping box.  Don't be surprised if your Acer laptop gets damaged or lessens it's lifespan from this poor shipment technique.-My other Acer laptop has funny ""keyboard"" marks on the screen because the rubber tabs on the screen isn't high enough to prevent pressure on the screen from pushing against the keyboard (thus creating a mark).  I now keep the fabricky piece thingy that came with the packaging in-between the keyboard and the screen.  Better safe than sorry.-I don't use the webcam or the touchpad so can't speak for those.  I put a piece of opaque tape over the webcam :p-Switch BIOS to UEFI so USB drives (i.e. Windows installer image) will load.-If you don't purchase new RAM you might see peeps like me selling the Kingston RAM that came with this laptop on eBay which you can purchase to make your laptop have 8GB RAM.  Who runs computers with 4GB these days anyways???Here's what I've had to do so far to get this system up to my standards:1. Install a Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 2280 SATA III SSD (Model # MZN5E250BW).  Make sure you get an M.2 SATA III SSD and not a PCIe or regular SATA connector type SSD.  If you get the regular SATA port type SSD it'll work but you won't be able to keep your regular hard drive.  I got it for about $70 during Black Friday.  w00t!  (This allows Windows 10 Pro to boot in about 2 seconds.  Yes you heard me right.  2 seconds).Crystal Mark confirms 551.7 MB/s sustained reads and 529.7 MB/s writes.4K Q32T1 (random read/write - which is even more important than sustained reads/writes) is 247.7 MB/s reads and 221.9 MB/s writes.2. Download the MediaCreationTool.exe utility from Microsoft so that I can download the Windows 10 ISO (which includes Home and Pro on the same ISO) unto a super fast SanDisk Extreme USB stick (200 MB/s read/write).3. Edit the USB contents (after creating the ISO from this utility) by manually creating a file called ""ei.cfg"" in the ""sources"" folder and add the contents:[Channel]_Default[VL]04. By adding this ei.cfg file with this info what happens is when installing Windows 10 from the USB stick it'll prompt you what edition of Windows 10 you want.  This makes it effectively an ""Any Version"" like Windows 7's trick.  Why would you want to do this?  Because Windows 10 Home is spyware central.  That's right Microsoft is spying on you.  Windows 10 Pro allows you to hack the system to prevent Microsoft from spying on you which leads me to the next point.5. If you don't do this ""ei.cfg"" trick thingy majjigy what happens is when Windows 10 installs it'll detect what's embedded in the Acer BIOS and thus you automatically get Windows 10 Home even if you unplug the slow 5400 RPM drive that's included.  And yes make sure you unplug/remove this from the laptop before installing Windows so it doesn't add unnecessary boot information to that drive.  Doing so slows down the bootup process AND causes Windows not to load if the regular hard drive is ever removed or goes down. Pretty lame ""feature"" from Microsoft.6. Anyways after unplugging the regular drive and using only my m.2 SSD (which I had to purchase some shorter screws to hold it down - I originally pawned a screw from the laptop to hold it down but this caused a problem where the touchpad was forced out of it's normal position.  DOH!.  BTW this is normal that no screws are included as SSD manufacturers for m.2 and mSATA SSDs do NOT include a screw) and then unplug my regular drive.  You may need to change the boot order in BIOS.7. When installing Windows 10 it'll now give you an option to choose Windows 10 Pro.  Complete the install.  Regardless if you follow my steps or simply just use whatever's included in the system when setting up Windows it'll ask you a bunch of random ""spyware"" questions.  Just answer NO to all of them except the ""Smart screen"" one unless you like to be spied on by Microsoft.8. Once Windows 10 Pro is installed simply locate one of your Windows 7 Pro/Ultimate or Windows 8.x Pro license keys you no longer use and use that license key to active Windows 10 Pro in the System Properties window.  You can Google where this location is.  If you don't know how to Google this you probably shouldn't be following my steps.  Don't make me use LMGTFY.9. Replace the 4GB (Kingston) RAM with 8GB HyperX HX421S13IBK2/8 DDR4 2133 SODIMM (2x4GB).  This HyperX RAM is the fastest I found.  It runs at CAS 13 (basically the refresh rate - lower is better/faster).  Now any true techie (not someone who goes to Best Buy as those are just wannabees) knows G.Skill is the king of RAM and has been for many years.  However the best G.Skill RAM I found ran at a CAS of 15.  These puppy has incompatibility issues with certain laptops but not with this Acer laptop.  It's rock solid.10. Replace the cheap 5400 RPM regular hard drive with a Western Digital Black edition 1TB 7200 RPM laptop drive.  Western Digital used to make ""Blue"" editions run at 7200 RPM but now unless you get the Black edition you won't get full speed.Crystal Mark confirms 144.2 MB/s sustained reads and 119.8 MB/s writes for the 7200 RPM Western Digital drive.4K Q32T1 (random read/write - which is even more important than sustained reads/writes) is 1.014 MB/s reads and 0.935 MB/s writes......Compare the SSD to the Western Digital drive.  Random read/write speeds are where SSDs (again good ones) shine.  2.0 MB/s is 100% faster than 1.0 MB/s so doing the math we get:-The Samsung SSD is 551.7/144.2 MB/s = 382.59% faster in sustained reads than the Western Digital 7200 RPM drive.-The Samsung SSD is 529.7/119.8 MB/s =442.15% faster in sustained writes.-The Samsung SSD is 247.7/1.014 MB/s = 24428.008% (24 thousand %) faster in random reads.-The Samsung SSD is 221.9/0.935 MB/s =23732.620% faster in random writes.-The 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop:Crystal Mark confirms 101.5 MB/s sustained reads and 91.23 MB/s writes for the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.4K Q32T1 random read/write is 0.811 MB/s reads and 0.885 MB/s writes......Compare the Western Digital 7200 RPM drive to the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.  The faster the disk drive is rotating the faster the hard disk headers can read/write to the disk.  Doing the math 7200 RPM / 5400 RPM is 1.333333 so 33.33% faster so that's about what we should expect.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 144.2/101.5 MB/s = 42.07% faster in sustained reads than the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 119.8/91.23 MB/s =31.32% faster.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 1.014/0.811 MB/s = 25.031% faster.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is  0.935/0.877 MB/s =6.613% faster.The differences can be attributed to various things such as cache different hardware and software logic etc......Compare the Samsung SSD to the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop:-The Samsung SSD is 551.7/101.5 MB/s = 543.55% faster in sustained reads than the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.-The Samsung SSD is 529.7/91.23 MB/s =580.620% faster in sustained writes.-The Samsung SSD is 247.7/0.811 MB/s = 30542.540% faster in random reads.-The Samsung SSD is 221.9/0.877 MB/s =25302.217% faster in random writes.-Why are random reads/writes important?  The operating system constantly does random reads and writes as opposed to sustained reads/writes (which is typically when you're copying 50 GB of movies from one drive to another for example).  So if your laptop/computer seems slow get an SSD.  Thank me later.  Got it?  Note: this laptop uses M.2 SSDs. I specifically got an M.2 2280 type.  Make sure you get an M.2 SATA III SSD and not a PCIe or regular SATA connector type SSD if you want to keep your regular hard drive.-If you got nothing out of this at all what you should get is upgrade to an SSD.  Regardless if you replace the hard drive or not with a faster hard drive you are a dummy for not upgrading to an SSD.-The regular drive is to hold my documents pictures videos etc.  I always redirect my docs the Desktop and other stuff to my second drive.  Then I use Macrium Reflect to image (back up as a complete image) my Windows SSD drive.  If something goes wrong with the OS I simply restore the entire image in like 15 mins thus my docs are NOT deleted and everything automatically redirects back to my docs on the second drive.  I'm back up and functional in no time.BAM!  Now my system will be MUCH faster and you can do all sorts of cool hacks to prevent Microsoft from spying on you (which you can't do on the HOME version) and prevent Windows Updates from annoying you.With the Samsung SSD from a cold shutdown (i.e. laptop turned off completely) to Windows desktop takes about 4 seconds.  The time Windows start loading to the Windows desktop takes about 2 seconds.  What about the time it takes to load into Windows using the drive that came with the laptop?  You try it and comment on my review.",1

October 17  2016By Saint Evil,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This laptop is a great combo of premium features with substantial power for general use. It initially felt a little slow but it got much faster after applying a bunch of Windows 10 ""feature updates' and allowing it to 'burn in' for a few days. Here's the gist folks:Pros:-Sharp & bright 1080 display looks even better if you tweak the colors in the Intel Graphics Setting.-Wonderful backlit keyboard.-The battery life is PHENOMENAL! Now it's not *quite* 12 hours but I've used it up to 7 hours off and on with reliable performance so far. In my experience that qualifies as phenomenal.-DDR4 RAM and newest Core i3 CPU make it perfect for normal browsing streaming videos or general office work. I recommend buying this for the empty RAM slot to get the most out of it: Ballistix Sport LT 4GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - BLS4G4S240FSD-Sleek design resist smudging much better than that glossy stuff many laptops have.-USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 C connections future proof your interface options.-The price $350 is a steal!Cons:-Screen bezel feels a little flimsy especially since the hinges resist a little so be gentle or say screw it and buy the warranty.-Webcam is grainy in low/spotty lighting. If you care about such things it's not ideal.-Battery is not removable which will be a concern down the road. I assume I can take the laptop apart and replace it but I'll let Future Me deal with that mess.-No HDD activity light. Maybe I'm just old but I miss having it for some dumb reason I can't explain.-Lacks premium features like an SSD dedicated GPU the latest Core i7 CPU and can't run Battlefield One on max settings. Oh wait I knew that because I'm not 'tarded and deliberately purchased this product knowing it had none of those things. Weird that I would complain about all that in a review. /s",0

November 26  2016By Joshua,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This does not feel like a $320 laptop.  The backlit keyboard the 1080p display and the overall solid (if plastic) build make this feel like a $500+ machine.  I had read reviewers who said the HDD was terribly slow and I'm guessing if you're used to an SSD it is pretty slow.  But I've been using budget HDDs all my life and this is faster than any of those have been.  My worries that I'd have to bump up to a SSD and add some more RAM before I got my money's worth have been assuaged.  I may do so in time if I decide to try and run Skyrim but that isn't a priority just now.  Also one little thing I especially like is the placement of the power button: it's inline with the function keys all the way to the right.,0

December 8  2016By BBradley,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Good machine for the price. Fairly sturdy case no bloatware and quick setup. Music sounds surprisingly good and full. Much better than expected and much better and slightly louder than my other HP Elitebook. Keyboard is good and keys feel solid not too mushy. No backlit keyboard but at this price I wouldn't expect it.Complaints: Plastic. I know everything's made of plastic but this thing is ALL plastic even the track pad which is incorporated into the case (see pic). It's not very sensitive and just doesn't feel great. Also the mouse keys are harder to press than they should be. It takes a bit of extra firmness to click them. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time but I wish HP had made this better than they did. One positive about the integrated trackpad is the ease of cleaning. It's smooth and rounded 3/4 lip won't trap stuff like a fully-seated pad does. I hope that makes sense. I think it does. :/That's about it. Otherwise it's a good value and I'd purchase it again.,1

February 17  2017By robert,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pros: it seems rather stable. I've not yet had it really freeze up. The screen is large. The number pad is a nice addition.Cons: it's slow as can be! Given the specs I'm surprised it's as slow as it is. It starts up quickly but programs take awhile to open and there's often hesitation before it seems to register a click. Also the graphics processing is sub par. With a screen this large I'd like to see higher resolution. This may be good for some but I would prefer more utility out of that screen area.,0

After getting all my old programs redownloaded and installed (Some even paid for subscriptions that only allow 1 download per device) and getting it completely updated I called HP and went through all the possible fixes they had until they recommended a full system restore which would erase all my files and programs with no guarantee it would be fixed then. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone unless it's an emergency buy and you can plug in directly to the internet via cable which defeats the entire purpose of a laptop.,0

Laptops,B01CVOLVPA,Acer Chromebook 14 Aluminum 14-inch…,        1 325 of 1 384 people found the following review helpful       Good? Yes. Worth buying? Yes!  Perfect?  Not exactly...  May 6  2016By Voltron00x,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"As I write this the Acer Chromebook 14 is sitting with 13 reviews all of which are 5 stars... and I do feel a little bit bad here breaking up the perfect game but after using this Chromebook for a few days I feel I have an obligation to point out both its strengths and its drawbacks. Even writing that I can't say I'm completely surprised by all of the 5 star reviews as there are a lot of things that this Chromebook gets right.There are five key things worth highlighting here.First: the screen. Many of Acer's Chromebooks have historically been hampered by their poor displays. Thankfully this time Acer has gotten that part right. The Chromebook 14 has a 1080p IPS display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness. I keep it at about 60-70% and it looks fantastic. It feels wonderful to finally say that about an Acer display.Second: the build materials. Chromebooks have generally been budget-friendly devices but recently we've started to see some that are either mid-range and high quality (like the Dell 13) or are upper-low end budget devices that still use more premium build materials like the Asus C100P ""Flip"" and now the Acer Chromebook 14. Note that I said build materials and not build quality.Third: 4GB RAM 32GB local storage. A more recent trend among Chrome OS devices is the inclusion of 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage instead of the 2GB/16GB to which we've become accustomed. For a lot of users the local storage limitation isn't a big deal as without applications local storage isn't that critical... but it is nice for people who like to locally store music photos and movies or who intent to install Crouton (or are looking ahead to the possibility of Android apps). The extra RAM however is great for everyone as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content without tabs crashing out or caching/reloading.Fourth: Intel N3160 quad-core processor. This processor isn't exactly going to light the world on fire but for most of what folks do with a Chromebook it is going to be adequate and it provides a user experience that feels significantly faster and more responsive than the N3050 on Windows 10 or Chrome OS and is also more responsive in Chrome here than the x5-Z8300 is in Windows 10 (such as you'd see in the Intel Compute Stick or Asus E200HA).Fifth: $299. When you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $299 you're getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this Chromebook. The screen is great for both media consumption and general computing/web browsing; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the Intel processor and 4GB of RAM and it looks sharp thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials.What's not to love here right?Well........ I hate to be ""that"" guy but there's a few things to pick at here.I keep reading comments along the lines of: ""Forget the Dell Chromebook 13 / Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015 this is the Chromebook to get!"" And for a lot of people that's likely true but I certainly won't say that's true as a blanket statement.Let's start with the Dell Chromebook 13. It has a smaller screen footprint but is thicker and about the same weight with a similar screen quality (and a tendency for backlight bleed); however it packs a much more solid construction and a significantly more premium ""feel"" throughout including its trackpad keyboard and overall feel in hand. It also has much better performance including an easily upgraded M.2 SSD that has faster read/write speeds and much more flexibility for those looking to install Crouton (to use Linux). That last part is a small subset of users but it is still worth noting; however the performance and build quality gap are very real and will be notable to all users. And of course the Dell can be purchased with an even faster Intel Core i3 or i5 and can also be upgraded to a touchscreen which again may be significant if Android apps come to Chrome OS.What about the Toshiba Chromebook 2 2015? Things are less clear here; the Toshiba again has better performance and uses a real SSD but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen still the nicest of these three.I think that a lot of Toshiba customers should probably consider the Acer but those who were aboard the Dell train for its build quality and performance will likely still want to move forward with that device instead of this one; if I had to choose between the two I'd likely go Dell... but then again budget isn't my number one concern. At $300 this is a great purchase......which leads me to my next point the omnipresent comments about ""This feels like a $1000 computer!"" or ""This is just like a MacBook Air for $300!"" The problem is that neither of those statements are close to accurate and have to be chalked up to pure enthusiasm and excitement.For instance the $799 Dell XPS 13 feels remarkably better to use than this Acer does as it has smaller bezels a much nicer trackpad a much better (backlit) keyboard and far faster web browsing and general performance. And while the Acer does resemble a MacBook Air 13 from a distance when you compare them in-hand any talk of them being similar will disappear. The Acer is very nice to be sure especially considering the price or $299 but tapping the trackpad results in a hollow response compared to the MacBook's assured sturdiness and the keyboard lacks the superb feel and response you find in a MacBook keyboard. The Acer may copy the MacBook's style but it doesn't approach it's premium feel when you actually use it.This isn't say the Acer is bad in the abstract; far from it. It has a nice oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all Chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use. And its keyboard is comfortable if unremarkable. It also has pretty decent I/O with two USB 3.0 ports HDMI and also 802.11ac WiFi. It does unfortunately lack an SD or Micro-SD card slot however.I can't help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the N3160. It is solid and does a decent job rendering pages and paired with the extra RAM here it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as YouTube or Spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs; but realistically speaking this Chromebook offers slower performance than the $199 Acer C720 from late 2013. Octane 2.0 benchmarks I ran in Guest mode scored around 8000 to 8200 which again is not horrible but isn't much more impressive than budget devices using the Rockchip 3288 from last year (like the $149 Hisense Chromebook). I only mention this because in my opinion you're getting about $300 worth of performance here; anyone telling you this device runs like a $500 or $800 computer is exaggerating. My Dell i3 Chromebook is much faster at loading tabs in general especially busy ones like CNN.com as is my MacBook Air 2014. There's a very real performance gap here when compared to more expensive devices but also when compared to Chromebooks running on the Intel 2955U or 3205U/3215U which in the case of the latter Broadwell chips can churn out Octane scores nearly double what the Acer 14 offers.None of this means the Acer Chromebook 14 is a bad Chromebook; on the contrary it is an excellent Chromebook! I led with those first five points for a reason: being able to purchase a decently-performing Chromebook with aluminum build a 1080p IPS display 4GB of RAM 32GB of local storage and an Intel quad-core processor for $299 is basically what the entirely of the ChromeOS subreddit has been asking for over the past few years; as such I have to tip my had to Acer and commend them on building a very nice Chromebook for the consumer space one which should do a great job converting people to the idea of Chrome OS.That doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed in the lack of an SD card slot the hollow feel and sound of the trackpad the quite average keyboard the feeling that the ""premium"" build quality is really just a nice ""coat of paint"" so to speak the solidly average performance which is exceeded by devices 2.5 years old or matched by Chromebooks at half the price the absence of a touchscreen upgrade or the use of slower eMMC storage instead of a real M.2 SSD.These are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4.5 star device than a true 5 stars. Worth buying? Heck yes! But perfect? Not so much.And please everyone stop saying this is a $300 Chromebook that is nicer and faster than a $1000 MacBook or PC because if you've really used those devices you know it isn't true... even if it sounds great in a review.",0
Laptops,B01CVOLVPA,Acer Chromebook 14 Aluminum 14-inch…,        218 of 232 people found the following review helpful       One really nice Chromebook  September 25  2016By Nicholas Sardo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm a Software Engineer and wanted a relatively cheap laptop that I could take with me and at the same time not have to worry about like I do with my $2000+ Mac Pro book.  I do a lot of development in the cloud and make use of a lot of resources on the net and so reasoned I didn't need to cart around a regular laptop.  Since I obviously do a lot of typing I hoped for decent keyboard-- and was pleasantly surprised.  The keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice.  And let's be real.  The majority of things we do everyday on a computer is covered by a Chromebook and it's large array of available apps and extensions (to Chrome).  Certainly for specialized uses we can't completely untether ourselves from a full on laptop or desktop running Linux OS X or Windows.  But Chromebooks do fill a niche.I just received delivery of this and set it up.  One thing I didn't like about Chromebooks that I've looked at in the past was their cheesy shells and keyboards and the cost of a decent one.  This unit not only has a nice aluminum shell (which is very attractive) but it also has a decent keyboard with much better tactile properties than any Chromebooks I've looked at in the past.  It actually looks and feels like a laptop instead of some plastic toy.The hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings:  4G Ram 32G storage Quad-core processor etc.  The screen is beautiful and the speakers are very nice.  Better in fact than some of my laptops.  The mouse area is responsive and has a nice feel to it.  The overall unit has a slim profile and is light weight.When I was comparing this model against other manufacturer's / model's the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader/writer.  Ultimately what I decided was that: (a) with google drive microsoft drive box dropbox etc. there is no good reason to require a reader/writer as I can simply save and download whatever I want from the cloud and (b) 32GB is plenty of local storage for a Chromebook.Thus far I am very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it.,0

I bought this Chromebook more out of curiosity than any urgent need.I wanted to see how different it was from my Win7 laptop. Great decision!Can't beat the price for the features.Fast startup compared to any Windows machine I've ever used.Long battery life - I've had it on for as much as 9hrsVery lightweight. I take this everywhere because it just doesn't seem to weigh anything. This is similar to a MacBook Air in weight.The learning curve for this Chromebook is very shallow. I had a friend that visited and who knows nothing about computers and is a MacBook user.The friend needed a computer for an emergency. She just opened up this Chromebook and went to work for a few hours and never asked for any help. To me this was strong validation that the Chromebook concept is great for most computer needs.I also watch a ton of online TV shows. The sites I use for TV shows from all over the world unfortunately have lots of popup ads and try often to hijack my browsers so virus protections must be up to date and VPNs turned on when I use a Windows computer. This chromebook is so much more secure-  it has become my primary media device. I simply added the extensions - Ad Blocker Pro and Tunnelbear VPN and I'm safe. So is my home network!!I love that friends and family who have gmail accounts can use my chromebook as if it were their own but never have access to my info.All-in-all this Chromebook is a perfect 2nd computer and on it's own can do 90% of everything you want a computer to do...and 100% of what I spend most of my time doing with a computer- web surfing media watching emailing and social media. When I bought this Acer 14  Google provided 2-yrs of complimentary 100GB online storage for Google's Drive,0
Laptops,B01CVOLVPA,Acer Chromebook 14 Aluminum 14-inch…,        23 of 25 people found the following review helpful       Replaced my Acer Chromebook 15  May 14  2016By T. Masoner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this to replace my Acer Chromebook 15. I wanted something just a bit smaller and I was sold on the aluminium case. I had to wait a long month to get it after I preordered but it was well worth the wait. In response to some of the complaints I've seen online for this Chromebook; I don't really have any use for a backlit keyboard so that's a non-issue for me I never used an SD card on my old Acer so the lack of an SD card slot on this one isn't a problem (it has 2 USB 3 ports and I use flash drives anyway) I always felt the screen brightness on the 15 was a bit much I always had to turn it down 5 or 6 clicks every time I booted it up I still turn the screen down 3 or 4 clicks on the 14 so while it is not as bright as the 15 it's not as bad as you may think. But on the other hand I do notice it isn't quite as fast as my old Acer 15. That's not a deal breaker for me but keep in mind it is a noticeable difference even on light duty tasks. On the other hand it is the perfect size for me. It is much more comfortable to sit in my lap while I'm in bed watching TV and the charger is a lot smaller too so it is easier to find a sleeve or pouch you can fit the charger in. Not that you'll really need it this one has much better battery life than the 15. Over all if you want something larger than the 11"" and 13"" models and you think the 15"" is just a bit too large this is a great compromise. I highly recommended it.",0

I'm a long time Windows user but started using Chrome as my browser of choice a few years back.  I also have an Android phone that's tied to Google's services and appreciate how well the user experience transfers between the phone and desktop.  After an honest evaluation of my laptop usage habits I decided a Chromebook could meet my needs.I'm not a gamer and use my laptop primarily for email web browsing and light document work.  I also have Linux and Windows workstations on my network and access them via SSH VNC and RDP.  I'm been quite pleased at how well the Chromebook has worked for all these tasks.  The free SSH client from the web store works to logon to my Linux machines and can even do public key authentication and port forwarding enabling me to tunnel my VNC connections through SSH.  The Chrome RDP app also works well connecting to my Windows machines with good performance and I can access files on my NAS using Network File Shares  After using the Chromebook for the last couple of weeks I'd confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications.The quality of this unit exceeds my expectations and if feels solidly built while still very thin and light.  The keyboard and track pad are both quite good although I always use a real mouse.  Battery life is excellent and I can get several days use before needing to plug in.  With a solid CPU and 4GB of memory I can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance.  I'm not sure just how many things I need to open to notice performance degrade because I haven't hit that point.  Saving the best for last the full HD screen is one of the  primary reasons I chose this Chromebook and it is wonderful.  Scaling works nicely when needed using either Ctrl with mouse wheel to scale just the browser contents or using Ctrl Shift +/- to scale the resolution of the entire screen.  I've shopped around for Windows laptops with higher resolution screens and they are all well beyond this price point.  To me this Chromebook is a great value.,0

May 6  2016By David Watson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've been running an Acer C720P for a couple years now and while the Chromebook 14 isn't as fast on the Octane benchmark it more than makes up for it's performance compromise in build quality across the board. The aluminum is nicely finished. The 2400x1350 anti-glare screen is among the best I've seen. And I have a strange feeling I'll eventually find a use for the fold flat hinge which is unique. I've installed Linux via crouton and the only problem I discovered there is that the touchpad needs an old tweak at the terminal after starting the chroot to get it functioning properly:synclient FingerLow=1 FingerHigh=5This is an old bug in crouton that's resurfacing on a new machine.But those are nits on machine that I have literally waited for for years: 11 hours battery life while I hammered it Apple build quality high quality anti-glare display and perfect compromise between performance and power consumption.

I tried to check the status of my apple support ( that new systems get) and I did run into some problems. I checked when I first booted with El Capitan. I have not checked with Sierra yet.I do like the gestures you can do with the trackpad but it seems a little too big for me.The MacBook's weight and exceptional battery life make up for it.Overall I like the MacBook Air and I think it's a great piece of machinery.,0

Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        1 153 of 1 185 people found the following review helpful       First Impressions - Dell Inspiron i7559-763BLK  October 27  2015By Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Just received this laptop today 10/27/2015.***Summary***Overall I am very pleased with this laptop. I think it's a fantastic value for the parts you are getting. The overall look and feel of the laptop is great the red trim is not overbearing. Using the laptop feels fast and snappy. Boots Windows 10 in less than 20 seconds! The weight and size keeps it portable but it's no Ultrabook. The laptop doesn't have a touchscreen if that's a deal-breaker for you.More details are below wanted to keep the summary at the top for the folks who don't care to read the whole review.***Short review***Build quality seems good to me. The unit is all plastic on the outside; however I am okay with this. It is a very soft plastic that is nice to the touch. The unit does not feel flimsy and seems fairly durable. It also appears (at first glance) that access to the HDD and RAM won't be terrible as opposed to some other new laptops on the market there seems to be a removable plate/panel on the bottom of the laptop to access the bottom of the mainboard picture attached.Boot time is rather fast. From the time I hit the power button it takes about 17 seconds until I am at my Windows 10 desktop environment. This is exactly what I was looking for. You will not achieve this in laptops without an SSD hard drive.Wireless internet signal is pretty strong. I am fully able to receive a signal in the very back room of my house (35+ feet w/ walls) on par with iPhone 6 Plus.The main storage drive is an SSD it is a SanDisk Z400s M.2 2280 256GB. Read/Write speeds are fairly strong I have attached a picture from a CrystalDiskMark speed test I ran. The SSD drive from Dell has (4) partitions you are left with approximately 200GB free of 225GB available when you receive it. The Dell backup image takes up about 12GB. The fact that your operating system is installed on the M.2 drive would mean that you can add an additional HDD or SSD in the spare 2.5"" SATA bay for additional storage. I am not familiar with the spare bay yet.Memory/RAM is pre-installed 8GB of DDR3 installed in 1 of 2 available slots according to CPUZ. This leaves spare slot open for future expansion. The RAM is PC3-12800 (800mHz) (PC3 1600) Hyundai Electronics P/N - HMT41GS6BFR8A-PB with a CAS Latency of 11 according to CPUZ.Battery life is unknown at this point I haven't had enough time to fully test this. While playing around with the laptop for the last 3-4 hours I still have about 87% left.Keyboard is comfortable to use even with large hands. The 10-key pad is a little undersized but this keeps the primary keyboard area nice and roomy. The CapsLock key does have a light on the key to indicate whether or not CapsLock is on; although NumLock does not. The backlit keyboard features (2) brighness levels and is a nice blueish white color light output. The backlit keyboard seems to provide adequate light.Sound quality seems very good thus far. I watched a couple music videos online and the vocals were clear. The bass was lacking but this is a laptop this is to be expected.I really like that the charger has an indication light on the cord on the end that plug into the laptop port that lets you know the charger is powered. The charger also features a built in strap to keep the cord neatly stowed while not using.Not an overly amount of bloatware installed. Mainly Dell proprietary applications for updates and registration.***For those who care...why I decided on this laptop.***I had been shopping for a laptop for everyday use that could also handle heavier tasks such as multi-tasking with multiple browser windows open music playing light duty photo editing etc.. I did want a laptop that was portable but I was not willing to trade off the ""more affordable"" power you get by not shopping for an Ultrabook. I was also not as concerned with a touchscreen (don't care for a smudgy screen).My criteria was:Sub $1000256GB or greater SSD I wanted something that would boot Windows fast!8GB Ram Minimum15"" Screen Minimum1920x1080 Resolution MinimumDecent dedicated GPU.Windows 10",1
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        836 of 870 people found the following review helpful       Great all round laptop and super for games  including Fallout 4  October 29  2015By Thomas D. Morris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Got my laptop this evening. Before I even turned it on I added a sandisk SSD to it. Took about 3 minutes. Just 1 screw to contend with. The SSD was a tight fit and BIOS picked it up right away. When you 1st start the laptop Windows will finish installing. If you added a 2nd SSD you need to right click THIS PC then click MANAGE then click disk management. You will see 2nd drive unformatted most likely. Click and follow prompts to do simple format (I made 1 partition of whole drive). Then you're in business.  I loaded Diablo 3  Guild Wars 2 and World of Warcraft from a thumb drive. They all played flawlessly at full resolution will high frame rates. Guild wars 2 was in mid 50s. Other 2 were even higher with Diablo 3 being maxed graphics with no problems. Didn't even warm up playing it and WoW .Look forward to trying Fallout 4 on it in a couple of weeks. That should be a better test of the GPU and heat issues.  The screen does have some light bleed in lower edge of screen  but only on startup when screen is black. That is the only time I noticed. Not sure about visual  quality vs other computers but looks better than my desktop monitor at work and my 4 year old laptop I'm replacing. If they cut corners here I'm not really noticing that much since I'm not doing any photoshop or pro stuff where color has to be spot on.The keyboard is responsive and similar to many other laptop keyboards. Love the full size keys. Not jammed too close together so fewer typos. Sound is decent for a laptop. The laptop is whisper quiet unless you are pushing the graphics card a bit then the fans wind up a bit. Still not too loud. You can go to sound settings and tweak equalizer to get sound you prefer.  The nice thing about this computer is you can sneak it past your wife as a business computer but it runs like a much more expensive gaming laptop. Nice to be able to play a game while on a business trip. Will probably add 8Gb of compatible ram a little later so it will run dual channel. Highly recommend 2nd SSD in this unit. Runs games so well you will want to install a ton on here. Can get another 256gb for $89 any day of the week with 512gb running around $150-160 for name brand.  All in all very pleased with my purchase.Update: After a weekend of gaming and surfing the web I've found that you really need to download the latest drivers for the Intel HD video card and the Wireless driver as well. Fixes many little irritating freezes and glitches. Just go to device manager and update from there. I also updated the Nvidia 960M driver though I never had a moments problem with it. Still loving this laptop!2nd Update: Got Fallout 4 last week and have played more hours of it than I care to admit. The laptop has handled it perfectly with very little heat buildup. No glitches crashes and lag whatsoever. I play it on Medium settings and get 40-50 FPS . The game  works on high but FPS dips into the low 20s at times which will ruin your aim a bit. Only use VATS for bosses. Gonna try Witcher 3 next which I hear is even more of a graphics challenge.,1
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        231 of 245 people found the following review helpful       Good gaming performance for the price  up-gradable  warranty service could be better  May 30  2016By kunoh,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The Dell 15"" 7559 is a surprisingly good Windows 10 gaming laptop. This is considered a ""budget gaming laptop"" because its price is so low ($800-$860). I've seen 2 main configurations. The first is a Core i5 with a 256gb SSD. The second is a Core i7 with a 1TB Hybrid HDD which is what this review is about. Both these configurations come with 8gb RAM and a 1080p display. What caught my eye is the 4gb version of the Geforce 960M graphics card that this laptop comes with. Typically most ""budget gaming laptops"" below $1000 only offer the 2gb version.Gaming PerformanceOnce the laptop is set up playing games on this laptop is fun and they all look quite good. As mentioned before the 7559 has the 4gb version of the 960M - which is considered a budget-friendly graphics card. Counter-Strike GO Dota 2 Starcraft 2 Just Cause 3 Half-Life 2 and Fallout 4 run flawlessly. - and at high settings. The most demanding game that I've played on it so far is Dark Souls 3. I average around 40-45 fps in that game with settings set on high. I can manage 50+ fps when I turn things down to medium or below. By gaming standards this is somewhat mediocre to be honest but it's still perfectly playable. By contrast a 970M would definitely be a huge step up but most laptops with that graphics card are considerably more expensive. This laptop uses a hybrid-HDD as its main storage (8gb are on an included SSD that works in conjunction with the HDD). This means its a bit faster than most standard HDDs but nowhere near as fast a pure SSD. Still the loading isn't bad at all and I barely notice it most of the time.Set upThe Set up took about 2 hours for me. That's because I had problems after installing the latest Nvidia drivers and their Geforce Experience software. I had some graphic glitches that started to occur (I got error messages from windows and a few games that I installed kept crashing.) To resolve this problem I did a system restore which brought the laptop back to its original state. Then I updated drivers and the BIOS using Dell's own update software - ""Dell Update."" Once this was done I attempted again to install the latest display drivers from Nvidia and the Geforce Experience software. This time after trying out a few games I had no problems. Suffice to say before installing anything I suggest running Dell Update first.Build Quality Keyboard TrackpadOverall the outside of the laptop feels good with soft-touch plastics on key areas. The laptop opens and closes nicely though there is some noticeable flexing in the housing of the screen. However the keyboard of this laptop does not feel very good at all. The keystroke is very shallow - so you don't get that tactile feel. And because of that I've mistyped more often on this keyboard than any of my other laptops. (To be fair though most other laptops in this price range have similar keyboards that aren't very tactile.) The trackpad works well enough for websurfing but the tap features often caused me to click on things I didn't want to. (You can turn off the tap function and rely only on the standard firm-click instead.) Suffice to say I would suggest getting a separate keyboard and mouse whenever using the 7559.ScreenThe IPS display that comes with the 7559 is good enough for gaming but not for graphics-related work. The colors seem a bit off even after adjusting them. Also compared to a professional workstation monitor the sharpness is not quite the same. For gaming though it works well and there is no ghosting or weird artifacts. Thankfully Dell includes an HDMI out so that you can output the video to a separate monitor. (You can of course get a much higher resolution monitor for the 7559 but only on Dell's own website - and only if you customize it yourself.)AudioThe speakers on the 7559 are fairly cheap sounding. I would say they are on par with small PC speakers that sell for about $10-$15. And although it does have a subwoofer I would say that the bass response is lackluster. You're better off using your own headphones - which is what I do. I personally have it paired with my V-moda Crossfade Wireless bluetooth headphones - and the audio sounds great. (The 7559 does have the standard audio jack for a physical connection of course.)BatteryIn my experience the 7559's battery does not last very long. When gaming I can get around 2 hours out of a full charge. When watching streaming video the 7559 lasts around 4 hours. Surfing the internet and working on text documents lasts a little longer - at about 4.5 hours in my experience. I've taken it on short trips playing about an hour or so of gaming and internet surfing afterwards - this usually gets me around 3 hours of use. But if I were to take it on a long trip I would definitely have a 2nd fully-charged battery ready-to-go.Heat - tolerableThe center of the keyboard and the left side of the laptop often get warm during gaming. It's nowhere near as warm as other laptops that I've used so it doesn't bother me. (During non-gaming sessions these spots remain cool.)UpgradingThe Dell 7559 was designed to be upgraded easily. The bottom panel of the laptop can be removed by undoing just one screw. Once it's opened up you'll find that the SSD the RAM and the HDD can easily be upgraded. The RAM is very easy to upgrade since this laptop has two slots for RAM modules - one of which was already taken up by an 8GB module. I bought another 8gb module (DDR3 laptop memory) from Amazon (about $25) and placed it in the extra slot - for a total of 16gb. It took about 5 minutes to do it - very easy! Other users have added a 256gb or even a 500gb SSD into the included M.2 slot - in addition to having the 1TB Hybrid HDD. Doing so will increase the speed at start up as well as any games or applications that are installed on the SSD.Dead Pixel! - and Warranty serviceUnfortunately my laptop developed a dead pixel right in the center of the screen. It was very annoying since I only had this laptop for a few months. I tried several downloadable apps and videos that claimed they could fix the issue (by flashing the screen for several hours.) None of these things worked. After several days of chatting with Dell tech support they offered me two options: send it in to their repair depot for about two weeks to have it fixed; or pay $40 for an on-site repair. I chose the 2nd option since I didn't want to be without a laptop for two weeks. The bad thing is the part that they needed to replace (I assume the LCD) was delayed and there was no word on when it would come in. After about 2 weeks of checking back with Dell; they offered to instead replace my laptop with a refurbished unit they already had on-hand. I was tired of waiting so I chose this option. The refurbished unit worked perfectly fine and it was exactly the same model. My main gripe in all of this was that the whole process took too long to resolve - about a month. If they had offered me a refurbished unit from the start it would have been much easier. Also it became clear that the repair depot people and the people who sent me the refurbished laptop do not talk to each other - since the people at the repair depot kept asking me to send in the laptop to be repaired.ConclusionIn all honesty this is the 2nd laptop that I've bought that had a dead pixel - and Dell did a good job handling it - though it took a while due to the parts being on back-order. The other laptop that I had a dead pixel issue with was from HP - and it took about 3 weeks to get that resolved. I guess I must have bad luck because I don't see anyone else complaining about dead pixels in their reviews of this laptop. Regardless I do recommend this laptop for its low price and good gaming performance. Most games run well though not on highest settings. It's also very easily-up-gradable  Just hope that you don't get a laptop with dead pixel(s) like I did.",1

I continually upgrade motherboards CPU's and graphics boards something that can't be done with laptops.  Recently I have been looking for a laptop computer that I would find useful with a limited budget and at $800 it is difficult to imagine a better bargain than this Dell Inspiron i7559-763.  I made a leap of faith and ordered this computer before it was even released - something I have never before done.  So far it has been fast and reliable and I am definitely happy with my decision.  It even runs cool and quiet.  Other high points for me are:- Intel i5-6300HQ processor- Nvidia GTX 960M GPU- Bright sharp IPS screen- Backlit keyboard- SSDWhen I received this laptop I discovered another feature that I definitely appreciate.  There is a large hatch on the bottom of the computer that can be opened with a single screw (and without breaking any seals).  This hatch provides easy access to the memory and AN EMPTY SLOT FOR A DISK DRIVE WITH A CONNECTOR CABLE WAITING!  The only hesitancy I had about the features of this computer was the limited storage space on the included SSD (i.e. 256GB) but that is now a non-issue with the easy addition of another SSD in the future.  I even temporarily installed a 2.5 inch HD I had lying around and verified it would work.  There also appears to be an empty slot for another memory card but I did not test it.One feature I didn't test well is the touchpad.  All touchpads are beneath contempt to me so I always use a mouse.So far this is a great computer and I definitely recommend it.,0

September 28  2016By Gareth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is a great deal for the price but those who are less than tech savvy may have some difficulties.The first thing you need to do when you get this laptop is update the drivers. I suggest going through the individual companies instead of Dell's driver hub. The wireless card is fine but without the proper driver you will experience frequent disconnect/reconnect that can be incredibly annoying.My laptop came with a 256gb M.2 Solid State Drive. That leaves a bay open for another 2.5"" SSD or HD. I got a cheap 1TB HD for my shows and movies. The SSD is reserved for my games.This model also comes with an open spot to stick another RAM card in it. Make sure you get DDR3L I put another 8GB stick in there because I'm a huge multitasker and I always have 10-15 chrome pages open even when I'm gamingAdding both the extra HD and RAM was very simple. Literally anyone could figure it out.Now performance is acceptable. I knew I wouldn't be getting the best of the best as far as gaming quality but I still wanted a machine that I could play on. I am a hardcore gamer and I can easily play for 5+ hours without noticing the time pass. I wanted a laptop for on-the-go gaming. Sometimes I'll go to Denny's by myself and game while having some breakfast. I can play Black Ops 3 Fallout 4 Skyrim and many other games without stutter. Ironically Starcraft 2 is the only game that lags on me but I think that may be more caused by bad internet connections not my laptop. Most games I get med/high graphics with at least 30fps. Putting a game on low will always get me a steady 60FPS experience. You're at least getting console quality gaming with this product. The gtx 960m isn't bad. You will have decent gaming laptop here. For under 900 bones(upgrades included) it's a deal you can't beatThe battery is a beast! I also use this laptop for work. One day I forgot my charger at home and I was able to go all day and even game during my lunch break. I usually spend 4-6 hours a day on my laptop at work. This guy hasn't died on me yet and I have definitely put it to the test. (hint- set your display to high contrast you will save hours of battery life and save yourself lots of eye damage)Every ""professional"" reviewer on youtube slammed the screen quality keyboard and the touchpad. The screen color is acceptable and the resolution is 1920x1080 -golden standard unless you want 4k The keyboard is quiet and illuminated. The touchpad works perfectly for me. I can barely tap it and it registers the click.This really is a great deal. I only have a couple critiques: The plastic attracts fingerprints. No USB type C conection.You wont find a better laptop for the price. This is a wonderful deal and I look forward to keeping this laptop for at least 3 years before I will need an upgrade.",0
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        66 of 73 people found the following review helpful       Great laptop  but beware the weakness of plastic laptop casing  October 17  2016By Ryan Becker,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought this laptop earlier this year (February or so I believe). It worked great for a while and I didn't have many issues. I used it to play Overwatch League of Legends as well as do video editing audio editing and photo editing using Premiere Pro Photoshop Lightroom and Audition. I never had any real issues software-wise.There is one very big con though that is forcing me to get a new laptop within 10 months of buying this one. The case cannot hold up the weight of this laptop. Back in July I sat down in a chair while holding the laptop open on the right side with one hand. As soon as I sat down the weight of the laptop and the lack of support on the left side caused the grating near the fan and the left screen hinge to crack and the case to permanently sit open exposing internals and the left hinge.  I made zero contact with anything it didn't bump anything. All I did was sit down normally. Replacement parts for this model are incredibly difficult to find (I was unable to find any). As a result the gap has only gotten wider causing my mouse to have issues it wasn't having before. The left side of my keyboard from the edge of the case to the F3 key is permanently slanted upward and every time I open the laptop I have to press down on the exposed part to keep it from getting worse. Unfortunately for regular use it's gotten worse. I actually can rarely get the trackpad to register an actual press. Only tapping the pad works regularly now. I can't tape the case closed because if I tape it the fan vents are covered or the charger port is covered. This issue has convinced me never to get a plastic-cased laptop again. I've attached three photos: one of how I was holding it when the incident happened and two of the split casing.It's a great laptop but be very aware you are getting a plastic laptop casing and amazing for the price. I fully understand that sacrifices have to be made to keep great specs at a low cost. This is reality and I am not holding Dell at fault. The laptop is heavy so the plastic over time may have the same outcome for someone else as it did for me. Had I realized sooner to make sure I was balancing it more intentionally when transporting it this might not have happened so I am warning everyone else!,1
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        18 of 19 people found the following review helpful       Incredible Value  Highly recommend  December 7  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I spent quite a lot of time researching my next laptop and when I finally settled on this one I was surprised to see that it had an empty RAM slot and hard drive slot. So I purchased the i5 6300HQ version with the extra 8GB RAM. When the laptop arrived the RAM was in the same box and I quickly got to work un-packaging and installing. When I removed the back panel I was happy to find the most descriptive and easily accessible internals I have ever seen. Down to ""Remove the battery cable before touching components"". I installed the new RAM without any issues and then installed the Samsung 850 Evo SSD I purchased. The SSD fit perfectly into the HD slot without any movement.I have attached two pictures of CrystalDiskMark tests one shows the stock M.2 drive and the other shows the 850 Evo - 500GB. The stock SSD did very well compared to the Evo in the Read tests but fell behind a little in the Write tests. This is understandable considering the Evo is one of the top SATA SSDs on the market and probably the best value. Regardless the stock SSD outperforms most SATA SSDs you will find especially pre-installed.This laptop boots in about 8 seconds. The loading screens flash briefly I'm impressed.*One caveat: When you first start up you will need to change the default graphics setting to the NVidia card if you plan on gaming or video editing. The default setting is 'Auto' which basically means Integrated Intel graphics. Once you change that you're good to go.",1
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Great device with still a lot of room for improvement.  August 2  2016By Krishan K.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I have been using the device for almost couple of weeks and its almost perfect. I popped out the stock RAM for Kingston Hyper X 1600 Mhz 16GB Dual Channel CL9 kit and added a Samsung 850 Evo M.2 for OS drive. (Samsung Migration software worked great in transferring the OS).I will start with the cons:1. I got a battery which is already 9% on wear level which I will eventually replace under warranty if it goes haywire in few months.2. No Num Lock Indicator LED. (And its turn off every time after reboot.)3. No HDD activity LED.4. Fan Control is stupid in non taxing scenarios. The fans either do not turn on at normal usage and if they do they don't go off.5. CPU gets quite hot around 90C averaging at 85C  would have preferred it to be 5C lower. (Not using any cooling pad and Tjmax is 100C)6. The display lid is flimsy and flexes a lot even under slight pressure.7. BIOS Setup could have been more versatile and must have provided more options like options to disable Turbo Boost on Battery To Turn ON  the system when LID opens Num Lock Always On and similar options (I had a lot of them on my HP Pro book 440G2).8. Thunderbolt 3 would have been a nice addition and also the M.2 does not support PCIe/NVM based SSD.Now the Pros:1. CPU performance is exceptional GPU handles latest titles at 3.5/5 details with avg 30-35 FPS at FHD overall a very decent gaming experience. Have been play AC  SyndicateAC Unity GTA 5 Arkham Knight.2. Contrary to CPU heating over the level what I am comfortable with  GPU never goes beyond 75C even after a OC of 135Mhz/125Mhz on  Core/Mem from MSI Afterburner.3. Build quality is decent other than the display lid.4. Track-pad will not trouble you if you start using tap gestures (Double finger tap for RightSingle for Left) instead of clicking it.5 .Keyboard works fine for me and the typing experience is comfortable.6. Speakers are above average by laptop standards if you tweak them a little.,1
Laptops,B015PYZ0J6,Dell Inspiron i7559-2512BLK…,        17 of 18 people found the following review helpful       Best bang for buck in 2016  December 1  2016By Facelord,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm known among my peers for being able to find the best electronics deals on the market and after dozens of hours of research I splurged and bought the Dell Inspiron 7559. My verdict after a couple weeks of use: if you want a laptop that can play all the latest games at medium settings or higher and you don't wanna spend over $1000 this is your best option at this point in time. Dell didn't cut corners in this laptop's design - there are no killer flaws or nuisances that detract from the experience like a keyboard that can't keep up with fast typing a sub-1080p screen slow WiFi or a lack of USB 3.0 ports(the 7559 has three USB 3.0 ports and the one on the right side can charge your devices while the system's in sleep mode). The only flaw I can think of is the relatively high price for a laptop but it's far cheaper than competing devices with similar hardware; I can't even successfully nitpick about this thing.The i5 model comes with a 256GB M.2 SSD and there's a SATA port for a 2.5-inch hard drive. With the SSD as a boot drive the laptop boots up in less than ten seconds and general computer usage is snappy and responsive. I installed Overwatch on the SSD and the quick load times spoil me. I've yet to try the Dark Souls games on the SSD but hopefully I'll remember to update this review and report my findings - on a 7200RPM mechanical drive Dark Souls 3 takes about a minute to load any time you teleport from one area to another or when you initially load the game. From what I've read the SSD should cut that to closer to 15 seconds.The i7 model comes with a higher-capacity mechanical drive connected to the SATA port leaving the M.2 port empty. One point for the i5 model. A week after this laptop arrived I installed a 2TB Seagate FireCuda hybrid drive for all my future game installs; this is the first laptop I've ever owned with two hard drives in it and the difference in power usage and weight is absolutely negligible. Kudos to Dell for putting such an awesome feature in a mid-range laptop.On laptops with a 1080p or higher display I always play games with the anti-aliasing off. On a 15.6-inch 1080p display jaggies aren't much of a bother and I'd rather my system run cooler and the battery last longer than crush a couple jaggies here-and-there.With its quad-core i5 and GTX 960M the 7559 can play Overwatch at ultra settings at around 50-54 FPS and at high it stays at a rock-solid 70. On the character selection screen the game drops closer to 35FPS but as soon as you hop into the match the framerate doubles; clearly more of an optimization issue on Blizzard's part than due to hardware. Civilization: Beyond Earth stayed at 60FPS at around medium settings and I had the same experience with Starcraft 2: Heart of the Swarm. I tried a few other games like The Forest Black Mesa and Dirt 3 and they all played like a charm. For some reason though when I tried to play the new Doom the game was just as choppy at lowest possible settings 720p + 50% render scale as it was between medium and high settings. My drivers are updated and the Nvidia control panel said that the game was set to run on the 960M and not the far-weaker Intel integrated GPU but I'll troubleshoot some more and update my review if I can get it running in a playable form. Doom is the only game I've thrown at this machine that gave me any trouble and I'm sure I can get it running like a champ on this beast of a laptop.In the future I'll add benchmark results and what kinda gaming performance you can expect but beyond Doom acting weird I've had nothing but a positive experience with the Dell Inspiron 7559. I recommend it whole-heartedly.Bonus: This was initially delivered the day before Thanksgiving while I was at work. Unless the package grew wings someone stole it from my porch. I was so depressed I stayed home for Thanksgiving and waited by the door in case the delivery was merely a day late. Luckily I was able to speak to an Amazon customer service rep and they sent a replacement at no charge to me - two-day shipping. Kudos to Amazon for being the best.,0

February 25  2016By John B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Being that I've had this laptop for a couple of months now I thought it was time to give my review.Highlights:FastSleekStays pretty coolNice graphics cardI got this laptop for gaming reasons but I wanted a laptop that I could still DJ with. I've owned Mac's for the last 10 years but work with Windows computers in IT every day so there was nothing to get adjusted to. I have a gaming desktop that I built 2 years ago and also own a Xbox One so they all play nicely together. Being able to stream Xbox One games to it is very cool. I mainly take it to work to game on my lunch break. I use a Xbox One controller with the wireless adapter and it works like a dream. Most games I can max out and still get 60fps. For the most part I am very pleased with this purchase.Reading some of the other reviews before I purchased I was still kind of worried about some things. Mainly I saw a lot of people had wifi/network issues. So out of the box I went straight to the device manager and updated everything. After doing this I never had any wifi issues. The only driver issue I had was an issue with the Intel Graphics driver. I saw online that others had this issue too not just with this laptop either. I changed that driver to a universal driver and stopped having the issue. I mainly use the Nvidia graphics card so it didn’t bother me. But I was bothered that this was an issue with a lot of models and thought a fix should have already been found. No biggie.Here’s where I started having problems. My first one I received (Nov 2015) it starting having a warping issue to the outside housing/case. I sent the laptop back to Amazon and they sent a new one (Dec 2015). All was well with the new one. Then about 1 week ago (almost 3 months of use) the right fan started making this awful loud noise. I knew it wasn’t normal at all because it has never done that. I had to send it off to Dell’s repair service. Another thing I noticed is what a lot of others noticed there were backlight bleeding issues with the display. After some researching (before I purchased) I found this was an issue with the type of display and not isolated to Dell or even laptops. Maybe I’ll get that repaired before the warranty runs out and they have some better screens. Also note that was an issue with both laptops I received. The trackpad as others have stated is not that good. But I rarely use it and always prefer a mouse. One annoyance I have is the matte finish. It looks nice and all but every time you touch it you get smudges all over the case and they are not easy to remove. All of that aside I still think it’s a really good laptop for the price. My reservation is about the repair process I had to wait 2 days for a box from Dell then it was a 7-10 day turnaround. If this is your only computer then that could be a major pain. I have other computers so it did not bother me one bit.Gaming wise I love it. It can handle games at the same settings that my desktop can play. I have the GTX 960 4GB in my desktop and this laptop has the GTX 960m 4GB. That alone is the reason I got this computer over all the others. This graphics card does its job very well. I was majorly impressing by the Xbox One streaming. I was streaming over wifi with hardly any framerate loss. The Steam sync also comes in handy for switching between my desktop and laptop. I can pick the game back up right where I left it no matter which one I play on. My Sony Gold wireless headset works perfect with it too. If you’re looking at this laptop for gaming reasons then this is a good choice for under $800-$1000. I still want to max the ram out and add a second SSD. I use it stand alone and with another monitor at home both work flawlessly.TLDR; If you are looking for another gaming computer or just want a gaming device to be portable this is a great choice. If it will be your only computer you might want to pick something a little more stable as you could run into an issue here and there under heavy use. I don’t use it more than 1 hour a day so even under light use I ran into some issues. I couldn’t find a sleeve to fit it so I had to buy a backpack to carry it around. Found a Samsonite backpack with a laptop pouch for under $20.Pros:Nvidia Graphics Card (4GB)Fast BootSSDXbox StreamingNice SoundSleek DesignCons:Matte Finish shows a lot of spots when touchedBacklight Bleeding on displayOdd shape not allowing it to fit in most standard sleeves (was even hard to fit in Dell’s service box)Trackpad,0
Laptops,B01DT49XN8,ASUS K501UW-AB78 15.6-inch Full-HD…,        278 of 284 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Laptop - easy upgrade to dual channel  August 20  2016By slam1818,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had this laptop for over a month now.  Agreed with most of other reviewers.  Light weight 4.4 lbs  backlit keyboard aluminum finish on top cover I7 CPU 8GB of DDR4 512 GB SSD.  Screen is not IPS but matted and 1080P.I already upgraded the bios twice.  Just follow the steps in eManual.  You can find the eManual under  Start All Apps ASUS eManual.  If you are not comfortable with bios upgrade  don't do it.  As you may turn your laptop into a brick.Battery life is good. I got on average 5 hours of watching Hulu or Netflix.  Surfing the web maybe 6 hours.  Based on some battery experts' discussions  they suggest not to completely drain or fully charge lithium battery.  They said do it between 40% - 80% will prolong the life of lithium battery.  I've been trying to do this. Hope the practice will make the battery lasts for years.I confirm that this laptop came with 1 stick of 8GB DDR4 by running CPU-Z (a free software you can download to monitor and show PC hardware components).  As shown in the Before Upgrade picture below it is a single 8 GB DDR4 and the motherboard is running Single Channel with 15-15-15.Since I will be doing video editing with this laptop  I started researching if it is possible to get another brand of 8 GB DDR4 stick to make it 16GB and Dual Channel.  The answer was as long as the DDR4 stick has the same specs even if it is different brand  the motherboard should run as dual channel.  Some discussions from Tomshardware say for some memory intensive programs  Dual Channel can have up to 20% increase in performance.Found this crucial DDR4 8 GB stick on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015HQ9TGW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Received the ram yesterday.  Installation was easy. Remove the 10 bottom screws.  Put them on the desk in the same layout ( a rectangle ) as you remove them since the screws are in 3 different sizes.  Use finger nail to gently ply open a little from back of the cover. Then open the rest with an old credit card.  Gently open the silver metal box.  Insert the ram.  Put the cover and screws back.Once boot up  the laptop will recognize the new ram automatically.  No need to do anything.  CPU-Z now shows the motherboard is running Dual Channel with 16GB of ram as shown below in the After Upgrade picture.,1

I LOVE it. I will first admit that I am Asus bias. Purchased my first Asus laptop in 2010 and have been happy with them ever since. I will also say before I purchased this laptop I did shop around and look at other brands mostly Lenovo and Samsung. Once again I went with Asus.This computer gives you so much bang for your hard earned dollar. I was looking at the new Asus Zen Book Pro (which is also a really nice machine) but I didn't need the 4k screen and the Skylake 6700 processor is sweet but the 6500 is just fine and snappy. I could not get over the price of this laptop with the specs.Now onto the meat and potatoes.I read all of the reviews on this laptop before I purchased it and the one thing that kept coming up was the screen quality. It made me a bit hesitant to purchase since I wanted to use this computer for video and photo editing web design business and storm chasing. The matte screen for my needs was a plus since most computer screens are now glossy I prefer the non glare matte finish. When I have my computers mounted to my RAM vehicle laptop mount the glare from the outside is insane this prevents that but most of you reading this won't be doing that! The screen quality is just fine! I really enjoy it!  Some of my programs had fuzzy text and that is not due to the monitor but mainly to DPI settings. If you have that problem just make a desktop shortcut right click properties go to compatibility then select Disable display scaling on high DPI settings.. Problem solved. If you use Chrome for your browser some text will appear really small and the format to the screen will appear smaller than usual. Go into your advanced settings in chrome and select font size medium and page zoom 125%. Everything will be easy to read and not out of place. The viewing angle on the screen is not like an IPS but perfectly acceptable. Do not let the other reviews about the monitor keep you from buying this laptop. I promise it is fine!This computer is blazing fast. There is very little bloatware. I literally had it out of the box did a little optimizing and ready to go in under 15 minutes. Boot ups and shutdowns are very fast. Start up and shutdown in under 8 seconds.*** Be sure to check for the latest window 10 updates*** I use Sony vegas pro to edit video. Rendered a 3 minute long HD video in highest setting in about 10 minutes. This would normally take 45 minutes to an hour on my last machine which is comparing apples to oranges. The SSD isn't quite 512GB like others have stated but still offers plenty of storage. Purchase a couple WD Ultra backup drives to keep your storage open if you are a file hoarder or purchase another SSD to place into the laptop. If you are new to SSD I will tell you this. The laptop I was using before this was getting slow and run down. I placed a Samsung EVO 250GB SSD in my old laptop that replaced the existing HDD and it is better than the day I bought it. It went from booting in 3 to 5 minutes to under 20 seconds. SSD is very fast!It's a multitasking beast. I hook up an external monitor to it and run split screen to have separate work areas and it just keeps going without a hiccup.I am not a gamer by any means so I have not pushed it to it's max from that perspective but it has never gotten warm. Stays cool to the touch. Fan does kick on every now and then but you can only hear it in a totally quiet room.Nobody has mentioned this but I found it to be quite impressive. If you like to listen to music or watch movies the included Smart Audio program is wicked awesome. Offers custom EQ for sliders for very fine tuning of your music. Match it up with good speakers or headphones and you will be blown away by the sound quality.The only complaint I have with this laptop is the trackpad. It more has to do with me not being used to it than anything. I sometimes make commands or do things I didn't mean to do.Pros:SpeedBuild QualityScreen Quality/ graphics ( Better than what other reviewers have mentioned)SSDBacklight Keyboard802.11 ac ( faster wifi speeds 40mbps faster than my previous machine on same network )Cons:Trackpad ( Again probably me!)If you are looking for a machine that will impress you everytime you use it and don't want to spend $1500 bucks then look no further. It was just released in July so there is not a whole lot on the internet about this model if you search for it. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!*** I don't do reviews typically but this laptop is too good not to do one I am not paid or hired to write reviews nor did I receive any discounts***,0

June 15  2016By Wyrless Freequincy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Alright just a brief summary first and I'll get to the pros and cons. I've used this laptop a few days and I've got to say I've probably never liked a laptop more than ever. It's light fast with regards to opening programs and boot time its got a nice big ssd room for upgrades like a 2.5in hard drive and 1 SO-DIMM 2133mhz 8gb stick of ram to make this a 16gb ram laptop but I felt the keyboard was a bit wierd because of the key texture the size of the numpad numbers (i use a pin for my windows log in and just used to the regular sized keys) and the cooling could be better gaming wise. The reason the cooling configuration could be better because when you're gaming the gpu and cpu are throttled. This is fixed with either a homemade standoff with the laptop or a laptop fan stand. And other than that the touchpad bluetooth wifi and everything else was pretty good.So here it is the Pros:Its light you can have it on your lap and it wont heat up (major bonus points because I would love to have a non heavy laptop that you can game on the desk but also use on your lap for less intensive stuff its upgrade-able and the touchpad it feels good and pressure you need to click is just right. Oh and the back panel is easy to remove and its held on by clips after the screws so be gentle when removing the back panel.The Cons:Throttling due to low rise of the laptop through its rubber studs the screen is not an IPS or higher quality the ram is soldered and the solid state drive has a capacity of only 476gb instead of being near 512..... and the back panel has so many screws....Also soon i'll be posting some framerate tests for some modern games and some classic favorites (skyrim fallout 3 etc) on my channel aswell as a review: Just look for Wyrless FreequincyEdit: Its confirmed that this laptop does indeed have ddr4 ram.Video review:[...]Just in case link doesnt work: /watch?v=a4gWz7M2590,1

January 1  2017By bweier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"FANTASTIC laptop!  No bloatware (besides Microsoft) and MUCH lighter and thinner than I expected.  Some ideas for potential buyers:1.  Install all Windows updates...ALL2.  Add another 8 GB of DDR4 RAM.  Crucial8GB Single DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD8213  It took 10 minutes and was SUPER easy.  Gently pry up back cover after removing screws...lift little silver rectangular box on PCB and install RAM.  Make sure seated 100%...check settings/system/about and make sure it says ""Installed RAM 16.0 GB"".  Still says 8?  RAM not seated...check before reattaching back cover.3.  Update BIOS from 300 to 301 using Asus WinFlash on your app list.  Soooo easy.4.  Right-click on desktop to pull up Nvidia Control Panel.  Adjust as needed from ""Integrated Graphics"" to ""High-performance Nvidia processor"" as you see fit.5.  Goto ""hidden icons"" bottom right taskbar and right click Nvidia icon.  ""Check for updates"" to update graphics display driver.6.  Settings/system/power & sleep/additional power settings.  Here set either balanced/power saver/performance.  Gamers know to use ""high"" at cost of battery...balanced fine otherwise.Enjoy!!  I am VERY impressed so far.  I dare you to find a 15.6"" HD laptop with similar 64bit Win 10 Intel i7 DDR4 and Nvidia 960M for less...good luck.  10/10 bang for buck even after 8GB RAM upgrade.",0

February 13  2017By Justin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've had this laptop for several months now purchasing this in August 2016.Never used an ASUS laptop before always using Dell but I don't have a brand bias really just how things turned out. Anyways I have no real bias with or for Dell or ASUS but in general I want to say that after several months with this laptop I've had a lot less hiccups than I've had with Dell laptops.Pros:Fast responsive keyboard is good (and comparatively to other keyboards where it can feel mushy and eh I highly enjoyed the typing experience on this keyboard way better).Cost to what you get ratio is amazing even if you don't self upgrade your ram.I haven't had a need to do it yet really. 8 GB ram is pretty good and enough in my opinion.Battery life is decent. Consistent at 3-5 hours of battery life depending how hard you run it. I probably feel more like 3-4 hours of battery life but only b/c I'm not running it straight down to 0 percent and generally start worrying about it once it hits the 20%-30% marker. But I'd say for sure around 4 hours.Feels solid too. I really love the metal sleek build and definitely a nice powerhouse to bring with me.Con:Screen I mean you're getting what you paid for. I personally I am fine with a 1080P screen. I had a 4K laptop screen but I had various problems with icon not scaling properly in something like Eclipse b/c of density of pixels in a 4K screen making it shrink to a stupidly small size. Along with other problems a 4K screen while beautiful definitely wasn't necessary for me due to not needed to work with professional photo editing or anything of that sort.So a 1080P screen is doing it for me. The only thing I will say is that the viewing angles for the screens kind of suck at times. You need to be looking at it properly and not like from the side or with your laptop too tilted back. (The screen might look a bit washed too? But overall I think it looks good and I have no problems viewing anything I need to online and still often will view photos with a ""wow that is beautiful"" without any impediment form my screen like ""This screen sucks.""Sound is okay. It not going to be amazing but it not bad either. Just okay. But if you have headphones/earbuds in you should be good.Overall:Highly recommend this product! Only reason why I am giving it a 4 star is b/c it not like it BLEW ME AWAY with super amazing features. But I would rate this at a 4.5 if I could. The money you spend and what you get is amazing.",0

IMO the screen is fine it could be better as I've always used IPS displays up until now but I've been watching videos and gaming just fine with no noticeable annoyance. There is always an option of using an exterior monitor for display as well but I have not found the need to do so as I am content with how it is.,0

Fairly large power brick2. Short power cable3. Slightly annoying fan the goes on and off every few seconds but runs at constant under load4. Heats up to 80 C fairly quickly in gameplay if settings are cranked too high5. Dual core i7 though it is a fairly good processor just don’t be misled by the i76. Not a fan of the num-pad takes up space that could have been used for speakers or fans7. Mouse pad won’t click easily in the bottom corners8. Thick screen bezels9. Somewhat dim screen brightnessPros:1. Light and thin as hell for its power2. 512gb of fast SSD major upgrade from my HDD3. 960m can run light games (Overwatch will run fine just mind the temps)4. Will switch to the Intel graphics when not under load saving battery5. Backlighting that can get fairly bright when you need it6. Touchpad is pretty nice7. Keyboard quality is pretty good.Overall a pretty solid machine for the sub-$1000 price mark. The 8gb of ram is enough in my opinion. My biggest gripe has to be the inconsistent fan spin/noise and the overheating though the lightweight and sleekness of this laptop outweigh these downsides. It’s as light as the 15 inch Macbook pro. If you want a lightweight laptop that you want to do some occasional gaming on I’d recommend this machine.,0

Once I bumped up the brightness completely acceptable and pleased.  You'll probably find some better for more money but I would purchase it again.  With the GEFORCE GTX 960M I am able to play World of Tanks on the maximum settings with no issue.  Nice!  The fan does get a bit louder while gaming but only then and not too bad.  Nice to have a gaming ready computer thin light that looks like a business computer.  I would not be embarrassed to break this out in a business meeting.  The computer I was looking for.

My husband did a lot of researching on laptops and really found this one to be one of the top rankings for the price range and it's features. We really count on reviews for our buying decisions. I had never hear of this brand before but my husband has and he's been wanting to get an ASUS brand lap top for awhile now. He finally did away with his old one that wasn't holding any battery life anymore.Although this is a gaming laptop we don't play games on it most likely at least I won't. We got it for when we sit on the couch so he can still do his work or I can. And he wanted for when he travels for work. And the sound quality? WOW very impressive I must say.I love the feel of how the keys are and how smooth they press. You won't find a more vibrant screen on any laptop. Featuring the latest Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M graphics this laptop enables you to stream HD videos run MS Office programs and gaming with ease and so fast. I was amazed at how fast it is.Really love the matte screen finish. Watching movies with super sharp detail was also amazing.PROS:classy gray metallic cover and hairline-textured finish.impressive battery life;great valuevery good graphics performancepalm rest and light weightCONS:none that we can tell right now. As we continue to use it if we find anything wrong or more to write I will come back with an update.OVERALL: If you want a portable powerful windows 10 ready for a reasonable price you can bank on this one.,0

It isn't a game computer but for writing and working on the web it works quite well. I will say that I do play the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft on the laptop with no problems but that isn't really the reason I bought the laptop. I wanted a compact package that I can take with me to work on my writing projects and to do web research and this laptop fits the bill for this purpose. It comes with Windows 10 64bit and I am able to use all the Open Office tools with no problems at all. Surfing the web works well and since I am on a 5G connection and get no lag at all when doing web research.

Wildly portable.  It can actually run League of Legends smoothly on minimum settings though I'm afraid to stress it with more than a game at a time (it didn't get overly hot or anything I'm just paranoid).  I recommend grabbing a trackball mouse and an external hard drive with it.  With heavy use (gaming music and Facebook all at once) it gets about 6 hours of life on the battery.  Idling and minimal use gives me 12-14 hours.  I have no complaints for the price ($180 at the time).  It has proven very durable but I could imagine the swiveling camera at the top of the screen breaking off if you hit it just right.  I still love it.,0

January 13  2017By Tony Wilhelm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I gave the Lenovo 5 stars because this product fulfills what it is intended to do superbly.  Let me explain...After purchasing chrome books for my teenagers two from Dell and two from Samsung I decided that would be the closest thing to what I was looking for affordability portability and ease of use.  My teenagers use them daily for school work games and etc.  So I sat down with one of them and quickly realized the limitations of using a product built around aps.  I was pleased with battery life the cost and the portability but I wanted something more useable for my purposes.I then came across this Lenovo.  Basically a chrome book built for those wanting an extremely portable laptop.  While I still prefer Windows 7 Windows 10 is a reality we have to learn to use.  This product is very well built as every Lenovo I've owned (this is my third).  I'm very pleased with the battery life and the quick start up.  While I'm certain this is powerful enough to play many games it is not a gaming system.  For heavier applications such as Adobe Photoshop I have a quad-core computer and a dual-core laptop.  I am able to run Adobe Lightroom on this but of course if you are serious about something like photography as I am you would want a larger more enhanced screen.There are a couple of things I would change if I could.  First the camera is great and the ability to flip from front to back is ingenious.  But personally I have no use for a camera on here.  Most of us have a smart phone for that.  Second a back-lit keyboard would be awesome.  Both of my other laptops have it and it is the one thing I miss the most.  Finally micro-SD?  I understand many phones and etc. use micro but many of us don't we use regular SD cards.  Adapters come with most of the micro cards to be able to use them in standard slots but for the rest of us we have to purchase a USB adapter to use our SD cards.  This is my biggest complaint but I see the entire chrome-book industry going to the micro slots.This is a great product especially for a price under $200!,0

I noticed it was a bit slow with video playback but that was manageable.However about a month after purchase I started having issues charging. First it wasn't charging at all - no light no indication by the computer that it was plugged in etc. I hard rebooted it and it worked for a bit but now it seems unable to gain a charge. As in I'm stuck at 47% for the next millennium. If plugged it it doesn't lose charge but doesn't gain either. And the computer continues to read ""01 min to full charge"". I've tried rebooting it again different outlets chargers troubleshooting etc. and nothing seems to help. In googling battery problems with Lenovo N22s it seems I'm not alone and many many customers have had similar issues charging and even powering on their computers. If you're in a position where you're okay with dealing with Lenovo customer support and repair services maybe it's worth it but as a person traveling and living abroad with limited electricity this computer has turned into a massive headache. I cannot recommend for people who expect a reliable computer.",0
Laptops,B01K9HS4Q0,Lenovo N22 11.6-inch High Performance…, small  prints to a bluetooth printer  best value if you absolutely need windows operating systmen  February 10  2017By bamboo groveVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This laptop at first was slow and almost immediately had an updateI wanted the 64 cause of windows anything less is a crawl and unable to do any updates making smaller memory laptops obsolete even if newIf you do not need windows go for a chromebook I bought this because my husband has a chromebook and they will not print to a bluetooth printerThere is no cd drive but you can get a portable one usb for $25 so I got the computer I could afford that was the most functinal for me.The computer is a bit smaller than a regular laptop in keyboard and monitor more suited to a lady or a childDo not buy a dell tey were my favorite until they wanted more money to fix something that should have been under 7 month warranty than it cost me to buy this laptop. I also decided against buying warranty for this laptop for this reason because companies will not honor it. (also happened with lenovo despite extended warranty that was purchased),0

Christensen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My wife loves it works fast for what she wants to do and a great portable size and I like how bullet proof and well built it seems to be over the laptop it replaced. Hinges are beefier and the spill proof key pad solid. Solid state drive should handle a drop too. Very solid function laptop for email web browsing and have MS office loaded and works well with that too. Very pleased with this laptop.,0
Laptops,B01K9HS4Q0,Lenovo N22 11.6-inch High Performance…, Great small laptop. Would have been nice if came as advertised.  January 27  2017By Walter Williams Jr.Verified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,The unit works very well for what I need. A computer that easily travels and connects back to my main computer. However I can only give it 3 stars because what I got is not what was advertised. What was advertised was an Intel Dual-Core Processor 2.16GHz. What came was an Intel Celeron 1.6 GHz. I was expecting a bit more power.That said the feel is good while typing the screen is readable the construction is solid.Does have one minor issue. The Micro SD periodically disengages. I saw this listed in other reviews and is not a big deal for me. I just reseat it and go on.,0
Laptops,B01K9HS4Q0,Lenovo N22 11.6-inch High Performance…, The laptop is pretty fast at least for basic things like browsing  February 14  2017By MarkoVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Just got this laptop. The setup/configuration only took 15 mins or so. The laptop is pretty fast at least for basic things like browsing skype and most other things that I need while traveling even with 4GB of RAM. Very fast to boot. Giving the product 4 stars because Lenovo phone tech support is an outsourced nightmare on two feet. Unless something is written in front of their faces in a script they will have no clue about anything. Otherwise the product is good.,0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…",        16 of 17 people found the following review helpful       Solid perfomance  needs more RAM  December 4  2016By NKA,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Budget friendly laptop with solid performance. Good enough performance for most assuming you upgrade the RAM which I changed to 12 GB because the stock RAM 4GB is not enough. If you want to do photo or video editing or play the latest games RPG first person shooters you should look elsewhere. This comes with a DVD burner whereas other laptops in this price range and all netbooks do not. If that's important to you then this may be a good option. There is 1 USB 3.0 drive on the side and 2 USB 2.0 slots in the back. It would have been nice if all the USB slots were 3.0.As a major plus this didn't come with any bloatware that you will get with HP laptops and other manufacturers. It's my fist Acer but for under $300 I think it is a solid laptop that most people would be happy with.,0

January 7  2017By Montana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Initial reaction to this laptop has been very positive.  It seems to be a really great unit for a mid-range user especially for the price.  A big drawing card was the user-reviewed absence of the bloatware that makes many computer purchases the preamble for the ordeal of removing all or most of it.  The ""precision touchpad"" turned out to be a bit schitzoid for someone accustomed to having a touchpad with right/left click buttons.  Dealing with it while grappling with Windows 10 as a new user resulted in the computer frequently doing strange and unwanted things.  A very comfortable solution was to turn off the touchpad in favor of a Bluetooth mouse.  The internal battery poses some mild concern but time will tell if that is or isn't a problem.  The laptop is reasonably light and thin without feeling flimsy and the slightly textured exterior makes it easy to hold.",0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…",        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Exactly what I've been looking for !!  February 10  2017By Cassandra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My old laptop had 2gb of ram and only 32 gb's of harddrive space -- i know the horror. Obviously this meant i couldn't do much on it; not that im truly complaining since i didn't have to buy it myself. As a writer and an avid player of The Sims 4 I'm sure you can see why my old computer just wasn't cutting it.This computer is perfect. I can download the sims 4 and play the game effortlessly. i can also do all of the writing i need to.The set-up upon receiving the computer took about 30 minutes give or take and hasn't once put up a fight.So far my only issue is how sensitive the touch pad is but I mostly use a mouse so that's not even really an issue.All in all I am very pleased with my new computer so far.,0

I added 1 stick of  the Crucial 8GB Single DDR3L 1600 (CT102464BF160B) and now it runs like a champ.  The i3 quad core processor is very strong and should satisfy most casual users.  This is not a gaming or heavy computations computer but works great for Netflix and chill.,0

The more I use and the more I discover that it is well beyond my expectations.It is good  to perform all kind of actions  however I am aware that it is not a gaming computer and probably will not perform well for games. But it is more than enough to use for  daily uses such as  mailing/reading/browsing audio listening and of course very fast video streaming which is all I needed .I have noticed that amazon has increased its price by 65 us within a week probably after a high demand ? I have increased its Ram to 12 GB which was a very easy job even for non computer  handy person. Now I can easily run a lot of  applications at the same time without any slow down on performance.I highly recommend this product for similar uses.,0

October 8  2016By Nathanael G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So far it is great. Almost no bloatware on this product. 1 tb ssd is great and if you are buying this for a budget laptop you really dont need more than 1tb. It has many neat features and is really a great laptop for low budgets. The only con so far is the touchpad is a bit large and does not have indicators of where the left and right click button starts and ends but thats not a problem just use a mouse. I highly recommend this product. I was not asked to write a review but i felt the need to because i remember looking around for a laptop and wanted help knowing which is good.,0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…", Solid budget everyday performer  January 28  2017By V.S.Verified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I purchased this laptop when it was on sale for $299.99 so I give a review for this price value. So far I used it for about 3 weeks. For $300 it's a great laptop clearly not a gaming or top notch one but a very solid and quite fast ""everyday"" laptop for online browsing music or movies low-end games office work and doing other common tasks.  Overall if you're looking for traditional non-touchscreen 15"" laptop and don't want Chromebook or laptop with small SSD drive it's probably one of the best offers on the market right now for around $300 most of the better performance models run from $350 and up. However for the base price $350+ I would consider different laptop.Pros:- Powerful CPU. Intel i3 is a rare gem for laptops within $300 price range- Huge for laptop 1Tb HDD perfect for file hoarders like me- Decent quality screen it's not great for HD movies but fine for online browsing or office work and I've seen much worse screens in $200-300 laptops- Intel 520 graphics lets you play some games easily handles full HD videos and with proper software converting videos with up to 10x accelerated speed- Memory is very easy to upgrade I recommend to add at least another 4Gb RAM to significantly improve perfomance and Windows 64-bit (unlike 32-bit) can use more than 4Gb- I like Windows 10 much better than Windows 8 still offered with many laptops on the market and this laptop comes with almost no bloatware- Loud speakers. Sound quality isn't that great because it's a budget laptop but it's loud enough to hear radio from across the quite roomCons:- Laptop's body is made out of very cheap low-quality plastic reminds me interior plastic in cheap cars you can scratch with fingernail. It squeaks and bends if you push on it and it's very prone to accidental scratches. Obvious cost cut - looks cheap feels cheap- Screen is not full HD it's only 768p so to watch high quality movies I prefer to connect laptop to my TV via HDMI cable- Battery is only 4 cell and doesn't last long but the biggest issue - battery is not accessible to the user at all! It's inside of the laptop so you can't replace it with extended life battery or keep a spare one with you for long travel unless you're ready to fully disassemble this laptop- Keyboard feels cheap not the best quality and layout of some commonly used keys isn't very intuitive. Touchpad is cheap too but I prefer to use mouse anyway so don't care about touchpad- Very low quality webcam just enough to let people see your facial expressions but don't expect much more especially in not brightly lit room",0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…", Great laptop - simple looking  lightweight  extremely fast with expandable memory and plenty of hard drive space  February 10  2017By Ram EachambadiVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have always had a great experience with Acer. This one is no different. For my use it does what I want and fast. I had two spare 8 gb RAM which I used to expand the memory to 16 gb. The boot up time is amazingly fast - it is hardly 10 seconds if that. I like its simple appearance too. And for a 15.5 inch screen it is amazingly lightweight and has a numerical pad (useful for you accountants).Be warned - don't use it for heavy duty gaming. This is not a gaming laptop. It is very fast and you should be able to accomplish a lot of multimedia tasks with this. But that is not to say you run wild with high resolution games. Low key games are fine. But I would not advise anything more than that.I know there are a lot of PC/Windows 10 haters out there. But Windows 10 really has improved a lot from 8 8.1 and the original 10 version. It functions smoothly and I have encountered no issues. I would say that you not listen to the blind criticisms of Windows 10. It's good.This has been a reaffirmation of my trust in Acer. Their computers have so far not only ""not disappointed"" me but they have been a pleasure to use. I am glad I made the decision to choose Acer again over the other brands out there. The only other brand I personally trust is HP. But that is a different story.",0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…", If you need something for just a couple of years until you take care of a few things  January 29  2017By carlitosVerified Purchase(What's this?),4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"It's good. If you're looking to hold you off for a few years so you you set your stuff straight this I think is your computer. It gets you the most bang for the smallest buck. 1000gb of storage? big ass 15"" screen? HDMI and (idk off the top of my head) 2 USB ports? Which I think is enough. It works pretty fast and it comes with a graphics card. I actually play Overwatch on this computer but on low settings. A little glitchy and not as fast to respond sometimes but I get to play so I'll take that. I think a big con for a product being produced and selling now is that the keys aren't backlit in other words the keyboard is not visible in the dark. A light will fix that but it would've been more convenient to have it there. I will admit the mousepad is a little weird as well. I like buttons but this mousepad is like the Apple Macs which are just plain. I use an external mouse not a big deal. It doesn't come with a lot of ads or bull downloaded in it so it's fast right from the start unlike this toshiba I bought before had. Overall it's a steal",0
Laptops,B01J42JPL4,"Acer Aspire ES 15 15.6"" HD Intel Core…", I spent a lot of time looking for a good deal on laptops  January 15  2017By Doug76Verified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I spent a lot of time looking for a good deal on laptops and finally settled on this one. For most people depending on their needs (not gamers or people that do graphics) this computer will fit the bill. In addition there is not much in the way of bloat ware not even a trial antivirus program so there was relatively not much to remove.Relatively lightweight the computer charge on average last 2.5-3 hours depending on what you are doing. I'm sure you can extend that by disabling/removing several programs but I doubt it you would get above 5 hours. Unfortunately it is not a touch screen but at that price who cares it has a 1 TB hard drive so it holds all that I want with room to spare.  The disadvantage which I see many companies starting to do is that the battery is encased within the computer so there is no way to access it without opening it up; I say disadvantage as I use to buy extended batteries to replace the standard one and to have extra ones on hand if I was travelling anywhere.,0

December 3  2015By Joe D.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"If you are someone who doesn't require a lot of storage space this is a great entry level laptop for you. The performance boost from an SSD (even a low end SSD) will far outweigh many other upgrades including additional RAM. This system is a perfect combination of processor + RAM + SSD for the price. When you purchase be sure to check for updates in Settings -> Update and Security for the latest Windows 1511 build that was released. The update will take some time to install but when installed it will improve speed by about 30% for startup and regular usage.Pros:System has a good low end quad-core processor.SSD is great for speed.15.6"" display looks goodSystem is relatively light given its size.Windows 10HDMI outCons:Limited storage space (not meant for those looking to store large amounts of pictures/videos/music)No DVD optical driveCharging cable has very thin connector to system can be broken fairly easily.Feels cheap though not as bad as you would think at this price point.Bottom Line:If you're looking for a low end system with no frills just to get basic day to day computing done or for school work this is a great system for you. Get an external hard drive to store your pictures and videos and you'll be all set!",0

November 28  2015By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pros:- SSD. It's faster than your regular notebook with HDD.- Latest generation of Intel's entry-level processor.- Windows 10 is a perfect fit.- Really big screen.- Really light.- Hibernate and wake up in a matter of seconds.Cons:- SSD option is pretty small. The default system takes up 20GB alone.- Comes with Dell Intel McAfee and Microsoft bloatware (which you can safely remove).- Feels cheap (well it is). The construction doesn't feel solid. The keyboard and touchpad feel plasticky.- Power connector is so thin feels like it could break.,0

Mckinnon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I love my new laptop!  The screen display is phenomenally sharp. This replaces an older Dell laptop I got a few years back so was anxious for the new & improved technology & hardware.  I use this for personal use only so unsure if I really needed to run high-end programs that this would be sufficiently fast enough.  I'm still getting used to the touch & feel of the keyboard as the 'spongy' feel will take a while to get adjusted to it. The audio is awesome.  All in all great purchase for the price.,0

I'm starting to think this laptop came as used. This was a birthday gift for my husband. The first day was running well. Now it keeps updating each time is turning on and when finally it can be used it not connect to the WiFi. That is not an issue related with the modem. All the computers and devices in my house are connected without any issue. The cosmetic appearance is acceptable and the quality of the material is sturdy.

One problem I see years from now would be broken screen hinges.  It closes tight on the hinges and this was a problem with my old Dell laptop.

Laptops,B01EGBAQXY,ASUS C201 11.6 Inch Chromebook (Rockchip…,        312 of 324 people found the following review helpful       A great Chromebook experience for a great price.  February 1  2016By GR,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought the Asus C201 4gb RAM model for 179 when it was on sale in December. After a couple months of use it's a wonderful Chromebook for the current price and is surprisingly a versatile device in an incredibly portable design. As many other reviewers have went in depth about the various pros and cons I'll touch on my own experiences and observations with the device itself useful add-on accessory recommendation and the functionality and productivity that ChromeOS and the Web App store are fully capable of.A quick summary is at the end if you just want to skim quickly for a more concise breakdown.OUTSIDE DESIGN OBSERVATIONS:COLOR- First off the color of the outside shell is a real dark blue with the ASUS logo in the center. Cosmetically it's a pretty sleek design that's also functional with its rounded corners holding the 11.6in screen. For some reason the color is darker than the images provided on Amazon would lead you to believe but it still looks nice. The outside shell can be a smudge magnet so you can get a protective cover to help prevent scratches dings and smudges.PORTS- There are 2 USB 2.0 slots on the right side and on the left side there is an ASUS proprietary charge port a MicroSD slot (capable of up to 128gb) a micro HDMI port and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Not including USB 3.0 or even the newest USB Type-C is a strange decision but for the current asking price it's not a bad trade off.SPEAKERS- The speakers are located on the bottom of the front which is indeed an odd position for speakers since the sound becomes muffled. Odds are though if you're going to want to listen to music or watch Netflix you would use a speaker system or headphones so this design choice wasn't a big deal to me since a lot of Chromebooks (Samsung Chromebook 2) have the same speaker design on the bottom.BOTTOM- The bottom of the case has 4 round rubber stoppers so this thing wont slide anywhere on hard surfaces. It's incredibly light weight sturdy and portable making it easy for both students and professionals to carry and use throughout the day.TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:DISPLAY- The display is 11.6"" HD at 1366x768 (16:9) screen resolution. As many others have commented on one of the first noticeable things is that the display has some weird viewing angles where the top parts can have darker colors wash out with the backlight and show weird contrast. It usually doesn't take long to adjust it where it doesn't have that washing effect making watching YouTube videos or Netflix practical for extended periods of time. Is it the best screen or ideal screen for binge-watching shows? Probably not but it's certainly passable for flights or whenever you have some down time to kill an hour or two and have no other means of watching video content.KEYBOARD- The keyboard is snappy responsive and comfortable to use. The plastic shell around the keyboard looks relatively cheap but it's surprisingly durable. I don't feel any kind of weird bending or anything off with the keys when typing so I don't think it's possible for keys to get stuck under the shell without trying or unless there's a manufacturers defect or user error. All the shortcuts you need are on here; refresh key backward and forward key for web browsing fullscreen window key program switching key backlight and sound adjustment keys the power button with LED indicator to the right of it and full QWERTY keyboard.TOUCHPAD- The touchpad is located below the space bar and covers a decent area i'd say about 1/3 of the bottom part which makes it easy to maneuver the mouse and use click actions like single tap double tap to hold and drag or can physically click to hold. It's capable of pinch-zoom and swiping left and right with two fingers to go forward or backward on a web page. It's also capable of other gesture commands which is typically dependent on the capabilities of the program in use. It's a well-implemented and functional touchpad for every day use especially for the price.BATTERY- This is one great key feature and for many a selling point; the battery life is incredible. I'm able to get on average about 11-12 hours of one full charge out of it with mixed usage throughout the week. Web browsing running various apps listening to music watching videos and it performs as advertised with the battery life. I didn't truly believe it when I read the specs but it certainly lives up to it. Obviously this is dependent on various factors so results may vary but with average use and maybe with brightness set in the middle you should easily be able to get the same amount of battery life as stated. This makes it perfect for travelling and for students who need a reliable net-capable device to use throughout the day without worrying about the next time you need to charge it. Video drains the battery the quickest so you'd probably be looking at around 6-8 of constant video streaming maybe more if that's all you have running on it at once. Needless to say though it certainly performs as advertised here.RAM and PROCESSOR- The 4gb RAM model makes running multiple applications and tabs at once much easier since it allows for better multitasking. The processor is a quad core Rockchip using ARM architecture which makes it less power-hungry than the Intel series chromebooks so this also helps with battery life since it's more power conscious than the intel counterparts. It runs at 1.8ghz which isn't as fast as some of the intel ones but it's comparably almost just as powerful for what it's commonly used for and is certainly just as capable without sacrificing speed or functionality.STORAGE- 16gb (eMMC for those who care) is soldered onto the board itself so it's not upgradeable (like the Acer Chromebook) with a new M.2 storage chip or anything. However the MicroSD card slot allows expandable storage up to 128gb.WIRELESS and BLUETOOTH- Wireless is current standards of 802.11AC and Bluetooth 4.0 LE capable. It also supposedly supports 4.1 but I haven't tested it personally.CAMERA- The camera is a front facing HD camera at the top of the screen I think at 720P with a mic to the left of it.CHROMEOS:When you first boot it up it will ask you to connect or create a gmail account this acts as your login information to keep you connected to the net and to Google Drive (and other cloud services) which is what the primary purpose of Chromebooks are to begin with. ChromeOS itself is a very simple and lightweight operating system that essentially thrives with online connectivity but it is possible to be just as productive while offline as well. The Web App store has plenty of useful (and free) apps that allow you to be productive both online and off. A handful of apps by Google are included by default but to get the most out of it some digging around on the Web App store is needed to customize it specifically for your needs.Here are some free Web Apps that I've found useful so far:GRAPHICS/PHOTO- Polarr Photo Editor 3 is a great photo editor that can be used offline as well and it's feature rich. It's comparable to a lighter version of Adobe Lightroom. Sketchpad is another fun one that can be used offline too and it's more for drawing than it is for photo editing. Pixlr Editor offers a couple of programs included for free and GIMP (GIMP uses rollapp and requires cloud storage services to be connected to it to be able to edit photos) both require online connectivity and they act more like a lightweight Photoshop but they're extremely useful and capable for quick image editing and adjustment. Wacom Tablets also work on Chromebooks but it recognizes the tablets as a mouse input since it doesn't install any drivers so you won't get the pressure sensing from the pens like you would on a Mac or PC though I suppose it's possible to get that feature in future updates.WORD DOCUMENTS- Aside from Googles ecosystem of Google Documents that's primarily used online (there's an offline mode you can set but it's not as fluid as some other free options) StackEdit is extremely useful since it can be used on and offline and saves automatically. You can also type in markup language and it'll show it side by side.  You can also export what you typed to Wordpress and many other blog services. Another good offline option is simply called Writer (the one with the blue circular logo and a W in the center) which is barebones simple and easy to use. It saves it's files in Rich Text (.rtf) format. OpenOffice Writer is also good and offers many options comparable to Microsoft Word but it can be used online only. StackEdit and Writer are currently my preferences. Another one worth mentioning is called Writebox which is pretty sleek and minimal that can function offline and can save locally as well. Amazon also offers one for free called StoryWriter and it's designed for screenwriting.VIDEO- VLC offers an app that expands the available video types that can be played. Plex also offers an app if you have an in-home media server setup that you can connect to. Chromecast also has an extension you can install to cast from your chromebook.SSH/SFTP/REMOTE- I use Serverauditor as an SSH client and SFTP FileSystem for local file transfers. Google offers Chrome Remote Desktop in the Web App store that allows you to control any computers you set up for it on the local network. You can set it up on the computer you want to control and you can log in to it from your Chromebook since it mirrors your Desktop screen and allows complete remote control of it.EXTENSIONS- FontChanger allows you to change the font for webpages that you can set up for either Global settings or Custom settings for individual web pages. Chrome User-Agent Switcher allows you to emulate many other browsers so this comes in handy if a page isn't optimized for Chrome you can switch it to Firefox to make the webpage think you're running Firefox. Ad Block is also a must-have to prevent a lot of annoying pop-ups and unwanted ads. Many companies (Pinterest Amazon) also make useful extensions to add-on.CLOUD STORAGE- Google Drive should be the default choice but Dropbox Box OneDrive and Yandex.Disk all offer free storage options.ACCESSORIES:These are some add-on items you might want to consider to either protect or enhance your Chromebook experience:COVERS- iPearl makes some pretty decent covers to help protect for daily use and they come in multiple color options. I purchased the Aqua Blue one and it certainly protects it from bumps and scratches: Amazon link to Aqua cover (but plenty of other color options)- iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case AquaETHERNET ADAPTER- Sometimes wireless wont be practical so luckily USB Ethernet Adapters have been made for Chromebooks for when you might need to hardwire it. TRENDnet offers a pretty reliable one for $13- TRENDnet USB 2.0 Wired Ethernet alternatively if you'd like to have additional USB ports and wired ethernet connectivity Unitek offers a slightly more expensive one for $20 and it's backwards compatible with USB 2.0 ports on this Chromebook- Unitek 3 Ports USB 3.0 Hub with EthernetMICRO HDMI to HDMI ADAPTER- Just in case you ever want to connect to a larger screen to stream Netflix or work on a larger screen/monitor.  You can also close the lid on the Chromebook and video content will still stream. Monoprice offers a simple adapter for $8.99- Monoprice Micro HDMI to HDMI AdapterMICROSD CARDS- These can be found between $20-$60 ranging from 32gb to a max of 128gb. These are useful for expanding storage of your Chromebook. The 64gb MicroSD card is a great value for $22- SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXCOVERALL SUMMARY:PROS:+ Sleek compact design+ Quick and responsive boot up and operation+ Lightweight and portable to carry+ Web Apps offer plenty of productive graphics and document options online and off+ Phenomenal battery life- 11-12 hours of mixed use+ Responsive keyboard and multi-gesture touchpad+ Well rounded portable experience from ChromeOS with plenty of room to grow.+ Constantly updated for the best stable experience+ Perfect for students travelers and just average daily useCONS:- No full HDMI- requiring micro HDMI to HDMI adapter to be purchased separately- No USB 3.0 or Type-C- Probably cost prohibitive to include at the asking price- Weird viewing angles for the Display causing colors to wash out towards the top4/5 Stars: -0.5 for display issues and -0.5 for ASUS proprietary power plug not including even one USB 3.0/Type-C or at least a full HDMI out.I hope this has been informative and helpful so you're not as lost as I was in choosing the perfect Chromebook!",0
Laptops,B01EGBAQXY,ASUS C201 11.6 Inch Chromebook (Rockchip…,        552 of 581 people found the following review helpful       Couldn't be happier with this Chromebook  May 9  2015By FreeDaveG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Couldn't be happier with this Chromebook.  I am a heavy Apple user but was eyeing a Chromebook for months as a lighter power-friendly alternative for both travel and bouncing around the office.  After doing a ridiculous amount of research I was expectantly awaiting the release of this model due to it's light weight and quoted 13 hours of battery life.  Now that it has arrived I'm happy to say that it has completely lived up to expectations on both fronts.  It is super light and lasts forever.  The build quality is also really solid for a sub $200 device.The keyboard and trackpad were both a great surprise.  I was initially unsure about typing for long hours on the c201's keyboard but within a few hours I was typing rapidly accurately and comfortably.  The trackpad is also a star.  It's comfortable and fluid and works about as well as the one on my Macbook Pro.  Overall both the keyboard and trackpad make the device a pleasure to use.I'm not a Linux user which is why I was comfortable going with a non-Intel chip but I hear if that's what you're after this may not be the processor for you.  I can say that with the 4gb version it has kept up to every task I've thrown at it so far (Netflix youtube tons of Google docs and browser based screenwriting apps).  In my opinion if you need much more you probably shouldn't be looking at a Chromebook anyway.  But if you're comfortable with the always-online nature of Chrome OS than this chromebook definitely has you covered in terms of performance.I could easily see this becoming the go-to device in the house getting more use than both my Macbook Pro and my iPad.,0
Laptops,B01EGBAQXY,ASUS C201 11.6 Inch Chromebook (Rockchip…,        56 of 57 people found the following review helpful       Great Secondary Device  October 26  2016By savvy shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So far so good.  I have a gaming desktop that takes up a massive amount of space so I decided to move it out of the main living area and get a Chromebook for regular web browsing and travel.  This computer fulfills most of my day to day needs.  Thus far I've mostly used it for general web browsing online shopping YouTube viewing and Google Hangouts.  Strangely it's a little slow with Hangouts compared with my phone.  Not sure why.  Everything else does just fine.  I'm looking forward to taking this on the road for several weeks coming up.  The battery life is amazing compared with other devices that I have owned.  I feel comfortable that this will get me through my 3000 mile road trip with minimal opportunities for charging.  I haven't counted hours but I can go 2-3 days at home on a single charge.  I'd say that I'm cumulatively on the internet for about 3-4 hours a day so that would be approximately 12 hours of battery life easily.  I've yet to fully discharge the battery so that's probably a conservative estimate.  The other plus for traveling is that this machine is LIGHT.  Compared with my Samsung Tab (with the 12 hour battery that might last 4 hours) paired with a bluetooth keyboard the Chromebook is positively featherweight.  It's also far less clunky.  The fact that all my Chrome bookmarks themes extensions etc. came right over automatically from my desktop was an added benefit.  I'll be even more pleased when Google rolls out the ability to run Android apps on this model which I've read is supposed to happen sometime within the next year.  This is mainly important to me as it pertains to PDAnet and some language apps that I use.  The one drawback I've experienced to this point is that printing is kind of complicated.  My wireless printer is not cloud print ready so I have to route jobs through my desktop.  I haven't had the time or inclination to invest in setting that up so I just do my printing from the desktop for now.  In terms of storage the micro SD slot pretty much makes the sky the limit.  I have a 32 GB card in there right now which will most likely be adequate for anything I'm trying to do on this machine.  If I need more I'll get an additional card.  In terms of styling I was a little unsure about the blue ombre effect.  I was afraid that it would look a bit cheesy.  Now that I have the Chromebook in my hand though I like it.  It adds a little personality and keeps my grubby fingerprints from showing up as well as they would on a completely white surface.  The bottom line is that as a secondary machine this Chromebook does everything I need it to do at a minimal price point.  Perhaps I will post an update after my long trip if anything comes up but so far I am completely satisfied.,0

It does all the basics that I need and want a laptop to do. I'm actually typing on it at this very moment to do a review. The pictures that I attached I actually sent from my phone via a very useful app called ""Pushbullet"".Size: Perfect for me personally. I went down a size from my last laptop that was around 13 inches and I have to say that this is just as good size wise. It is very thin so a lap desk would be best instead of just in your lap. The tread on the bottom is also kind of slick on certain surfaces though it DOES have pads on the bottom. It's just a very...slick laptop regardless.Typing/ Keyboard size: Good enough for me. I have average sized hands for a female and can still type as fast as I do on any other keyboard maybe even easier. Keep in mind that THERE IS NO CAPS LOCK BUTTON(that I'm aware of). I had to use shift to make that all capitalized. There are a few other not-really-needed keys missing like ""page up/page down"" but they are not a necessity and can be used with Control Commands (alt + up button/ down button).OS: You won't be able to do any hardcore gaming on this the Chrome operating system is pretty basic. You will need to download certain applications on the chrome webstore to open certain files (Example: you obviously need an emulator to play ROM games which yes I have been doing just fine.) I use this mainly for doing my schoolwork and essays via Word Online which is free if you give your student email. Everything is saved through Google Drive. I would recommend this laptop for a student-on-the-go with a tight budget but it has a lot of great recreational uses such as accessing spotify or netflix online. I'm still new to it so there was a learning curve with me the first 20 minutes or so that I had the laptop and I am still finding more and more useful things that it can do. It's so far super fast to load.Battery life: So far the battery life has been great. I've been listening to music for the last 3 and a half hours unplugged in my room and light searching the web and battery life is on 85% still. I think the time estimate of how long you have for battery life on the screen varies because of change in activities on the computers but supposedly if I continue to use this laptop at the pace I have been using it then there is approx. 9 hours left.To put it simply? As someone who has not had a fully functioning laptop in years I'm in love with this chromebook.",1
Laptops,B01EGBAQXY,ASUS C201 11.6 Inch Chromebook (Rockchip…,        23 of 24 people found the following review helpful       Super impressive and affordable laptop!  August 17  2016By Sarah A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I didn't think I'd be so impressed with a Chromebook but here I am to tell you that this laptop is pretty impressive. If you're a user of Google services and need a laptop to get work done this is an amazing choice.Firstly this is a Chrome OS laptop. Not Windows or Apple or anything like that so don't expect it to be exactly like something you've used before. It works on it's own platform that is obviously based on Google. That doesn't mean it's hard to figure out. It's actually a lot simpler to use in my opinion. The platform is straightforward and I figured out how to maneuver everything within thirty minutes of playing around. Now you're not going to find super complex programs and options like Windows and Apple but this isn't what this laptop is about. It's simplicity makes it a great option for the average internet user. It's also extremely affordable. About $200 for a great laptop? TAKE MY MONEY.I use this laptop for many things ranging from writing to watching TV. Because I am a huge user of Google Docs Calendar Keep Blogger etc. this is perfection. Everything is easily accessible and synced. I don't have much applications because I don't really need any but the Chrome store is limited. If you're an applications kind of person you might feel a little meh at the Chrome selection. However they're always adding more to the store. The WiFi is amazing too. It gets the strongest connection -- better than any device in my home and I've got a LOT of devices. It's also very fast. I can go through 20 different tabs on the internet and nothing slows down.It looks awesome. It's sleek thin light and attractive. I love the matte finish. Yes it does hold onto your fingerprints more easily than a shiny finished laptop but it's not that bad at all. Unless you just handled a slice of pizza before touching the laptop I wouldn't be too worried. It has all of the basic USB ports you'd need. The keyboard clicks nicely. Only downside is that the keys don't have a back light-- that kind of sucks for late night usage. The volume is also quite low -- not ideal for putting a video on and them going into another room or something. Not gonna bump down the rating for it because it's just tiny things.Overall if you're an average internet user who needs a reliable laptop for web surfing work note taking -- basically everything but super complex computer programming/gaming -- this is an excellent option for you. It's price along with what it offers is just amazing. A steal really.,0

September 1  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I almost bought a much more expensive chromebook but at the last minute I found this one and saw that it had everything I wanted great reviews and a great price. I love this computer!! It's sleek and portable fast and so simple. It took me maybe one minute to set it up and get online. It's perfect for what I use it for. I'm a student so I use it mainly for homework and occasionally for watching Netflix. This computer handles having several tabs open very well. I can flip between several different tabs quickly and without lag. The display is great it doesn't get hot when I use it for a long time and it adds no weight to my backpack. My favorite part is how long it stays charged. I barely ever have to charge it! Bottom line I'm so glad I got this little machine instead of a more expensive model. I definitely recommend it!,0

Ward,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This Asus machine is the best Chromebook for the money you will find. I shopped over twenty different Chromebooks from Eight different retailers before buying this one. I went for the 4GB knowing that I want it to be functionally adept for a long time. I am writing this review on this product right now. If you have a limited budget and want a quality device this is the one. SD storage mini HDMI extra large trackpad solid keyboard beautiful resolution lightweight speed comparable to Intel machines and crazy battery life. I ordered this machine late at night on a Friday from Amazon and it was in my hands before Noon the NEXT day. If you have not given serious consideration to becoming a Prime member you should do it now. Deals like this are rare and as a Prime member you get first shot at stuff like this. My windows 10 machine is a like a pickup truck compared to this sporty super fast device.,0

Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm very happy with this purchase. I occasionally write magazine articles and wanted something that primarily worked as a word processor and has a good battery life. At first I was a little disconcerted that the only word processor was Google Docs until I figured out that this can be setup to work off line. There are other off line aps you can download but this works great since as soon as you connect to the internet it backs up the files on your google drive. I like the keyboard and the light weight of the device and the 13 hour battery life can't be beat. The wifi connection is fast even on cheesy airline connections and it is easy to use and to get to the apps you need the most is a breeze. Google really did the world a favor with the Chrome Book. Not all of us need a 2k dollar laptop that is loaded with software that you spend the first week deleting. I've owned many computers over the years from laptops that run Linux to a Mac tabletop. This one is hands down my favorite. If you want to know if this will work for you software wise all you have to do is try doing your work on Google Docs for awhile and if that is feasible this is your device. I'm not sure what all of the critisism is about. I understand it can be a pain to print from and I have not tried it yet but with Google Docs anything you put on it can be easily accessed and printed from another computer. I wish there was an Amazon Video app for it though there is an Amazon Music app. I havent tried to explore the ebook reader yet to see how that works but for what I wanted email word processing internet music etc it's perfect.,0

Laptops,B01EGBAQXY,ASUS C201 11.6 Inch Chromebook (Rockchip…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Excellent Value if you know what you are buying !  November 5  2016By DanC NJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've read many of the reviews before purchasing this notebook. If you know what you are buying and depending on what you intend to use it for it's an excellent value. I bought this as a lightweight internet appliance for lack of a better term. It suits my needs perfectly. However I do not need to print from it or stream video from the hdmi port. I've read reviews where others had issues with these two features. Other reviews were just plain clueless obviously not reading at all let alone doing any real research before purchasing. If you bought it for your teenager for him or her to load a bunch of windows based games you will obviously be disappointed but who's fault is that? If you expect a Windows OS or even a full featured Linux OS you will obviously be disappointed. Again who's fault is that? Maybe these reviewers need to give themselves one star.I was a little hesitant to purchase this set up with the Rockchip ARM processor. I was tempted to spend more for the same machine with the Intel chip in case I wasn't happy with Chrome and wanted to load Linux. I already have a Dell E4310 with a Linux/Win 10 dual boot so that is not why I was buying this. I really couldn't be any happier with Chrome and the hardware performance I installed a 32G micro SD for storage and it has done almost everything I've asked of it  and has done it well. The only issue i've has is trying to open .odt files created using Libre Office Writer in Linux. I managed to find an app to handle them but it's not an easy process.In summary this is a nice looking light notebook with a decent display and adequate keyboard and track pad. It's much more usable than a tablet in my opinion and of course the cost is  very reasonable for what you get. Set up takes no time if you already have a gmail account. Performance and battery life are both outstanding. I use the display at it's brightest setting and I still get 8 - 10 hours of battery on average. It is the perfect size for travel carrying around the house or using it outside on the porch or deck. I would recommend it to anyone who understands what a Chromebook is and what it's capabilities are.,0
Laptops,B01LD4MGY4,Acer Aspire E 15 15.6 Full HD 7th Gen…,        49 of 50 people found the following review helpful       Hot Smoking Machine for the Buck$  December 10  2016By Porkee Peeg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,If you're reading this review it's because you're in the marketplace to buy a new puter running the latest i5 CPU or killing time. Well read on. Here's my thoughts after tweaking this machine to my liking.CPU - 5 *****For the $$ it is fast.2.5 GHZ turbos to 3.1 GHZPassMark has the i5-7200 rated at 4753. The i5-6200 is rated at 3923. The higher rating means better performance.This i5 rocks over an i3.Memory  DDR4 - 4 *****Kingston PC-2400R one 8 GB stick.SSD - NoneSK Hynix M.2 SATA III 256 GB - 5 *****Surprised to discover my rig is running with an M.2 SATA III stick instead of an SSD. The SSD hole is empty in case one wishes to add one. It's not PCI-e so you won't notice the difference in speed between this M.2 and an SSD. In a year or two I expect to see laptops with PCI-e capable M.2 sticks which will be capable of up to 32 GB speeds vs the 6GB SATA III speed.GPU Nvidea GeForce 940MXThis GPU is sick! Please note an unknown Intel GPU also comes with the unit. The GPU is where you set brightness AND contrast. You do this by right clicking an empty spot on your desktop the drop down menu will list Intel Graphics Setting and Nvidea Control Panel. Set every control to the Nvidea card; 3D and PhysX brightness contrast hue and saturation. The system is set to auto select between the two but appears to always choose the crappy fuzzy Intel GPU. I imagine the Intel GPU is what drives i3 machines. I can't tell you enough how horrible the Intel GPU makes the display look. Once set for Nvidea the display comes to life letters are crisp and sharp and colors vibrant. Display speed and screen refresh is speedy too.Display - 5 *****Glossy screens are very reflective. Looks cool but who wants glare who wants a screen that resembles a mirror? Not me. This matte screen is very anti-reflective yet at the same time very sharp/detailed as long as you set GPU control to Nvidea (see GPU comments above). This display has zero glare zero reflection even with a reading lamp above and behind my shoulder pointing directly at the screen or sitting in front of a bay window with mid-day sun. And no I haven't taken the laptop outside. I will update later when It stops raining.Keyboard and Touchpad - 4.5 *****Keyboard key strokes are very good not the best. Still very good for the buck$. Love that it comes with a numeric keypad. And that it has a backlight!Touchpad works great with no L/R buttons. Just press anywhere on the left or right side for it to function. It's quite obvious the 1 * reviewer is a NOOB or an agent of another mfg.Hardware - 5 *****Love that Acer didn't cheapen the machine by leaving out hardware. It's nice to have DVD R/W Ethernet  rj-45  port HDMI and VGA outputs an SD card slot headphone jack and 3 USB ports two of which are 3.0. There's an odd hole on the left side near the screen. Since the machine did not come with a owner/user manual who knows what this hole is for. Perhaps for a cable lock for business security?Cosmetics - 5 *****I love the brushed black look.Other StuffVery minimal bloatware. Used Revo Uninstaller to remove trial crap.Surface smudges are minimal and wipes off easily.Power cord has right angle swivel plug. And cord from adapter to laptop is 6' long.Battery does last 11+ hours. And laptop comes with battery life indicator icon located in the taskbar.Weight is heavy attributed to the long battery life. I'll sacrifice weight when I get hot performance.Is the battery user removable? Unknown for now as the back cover has to be removed. And my searches have not turned any replacement batteries for sale. In a few years I anticipate the market will be flooded with replacement batteries. I can uninstall/install any battery so no sweat of my brow when it comes time to do so.***UPDATE*** 12.10.2016I have noticed two buggy quirks; one irritating the other nonsense1. Touchpad scrolling direction cannot be changed. Settings>Devices> Mouse & touchpad> Reverse scrolling direction set On or Off doesn't work. To see the lower portion of a page you slide your fingers towards the keyboard away from the keyboard to see upper portion of a page. This is set and cannot be changed.2. Font size changes unexpectedly usually smaller lighter with squigly lettering. This makes them barely legible. Happens with Firefox IE & Chrome. Close & reopen the browser and/or App resolves the problem. Arrrgh!*** UPDATE *** 01.07.2017Wierd mechanical break-in period1. The font size changing on its own has stopped. Dunno why but it did and I'm happy.2. The touchpad lef/right action will only work on the bottom corners.. There's a setting for this which I unticked. At first it allowed me to use the left/right edges of the touchpad now only the bottom corners.3. Battery is user replaceable. Remove the 15 case screws and a couple  under the case and you'll find the battery near the screen.Be sure to pull out the DVD drive prior to case removing.  Pull gently on the small plug and wala  the battery comes out. Piece of cake.,0

A few quick specs of the components included when I purchased it on January 6th 2016:LCD panel: N156HGE-EAL (TN 30-pin EDP 94% NTSC however 15/15/85/85 view angles) -- can easily be swapped with other IPS/PLS models such as B156HAN01.2 or LTN156HL01-B01 which offer at least 85/85/85/85 view anglesM.2 (SATA) SSD: HFS256G39TND-N210A (SK Hynix 256GB SC308 M.2 2280)Optical Drive: HL-DT-STDVDRAM_GUE1NWiFi card: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377It does have a spare 2.5"" SATA slot in which I have installed a 1TB 2.5"" SSD. Acer sells an $8 bracket on their website for holding the drive in place but I found that the fit is very tight and can interfere with the ribbon cable used for the HD AUDIO connection. causing the sound card to not be detected. I ended up just cutting a few sheets of paper and placing them on top of the drive to hold it in place such as to avoid any rattling. Most likely a thin piece of foam could also be used as well for this purpose. I upgraded the memory w/ 2x16GB DDR4 SODIMMs with no issue and tested fine with MemTest86 7.2 with no errors after 4 passes.Like others said the touch pad and palm-rest tends to be a bit of a fingerprint oil magnet but not a big deal as it can be wiped down. Note that the USB-C port is capped at 5Gbps speeds but supposedly can supply 5V @ 3A according to Acer's website when you input your SNID and look at the information there. I was able to upgrade the included Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education by simply entering the product key from my university's Microsoft Imagine subscription and in the same way license the included pre-installed version of Office 2016 as Office 365 with my organization's credentials which made for a fast setup without having to clean install the operating system or any software. Very little bloatware mostly just the Apps that come with the Windows store and you can create recovery media for a clean factory install in a 8GB or larger USB drive.Idling it barely makes any noticeable noise from the fan and is cool to the touch. Have not done much stress testing but fan seems to put out hot air as it should when installing software or syncing a large amount of files to Dropbox as expected. This might be the first PC in a while that I have NOT had to upgrade from the default components to be quick/speedy -- well done Acer!I did swap the original TN panel with a Samsung PLS LTN156HL01-B01 panel and color calibrated it with a Spyder4Pro and it looks quite nice.",0

November 17  2016By David Cifuentes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Amazing laptop at the best price!! this laptop not only comes with the 7th Generation i5 Processor but it ALSO includes a Nvidia Graphics Card. Yes it is only a 940MX but at this $550 price range we usually don't get anything else besides an Intel Graphics card so this is a huge bonus. This system is also easily upgradable you can have up to 32gb of RAM (16gb should be plenty though) and you can also add an HDD Drive if needed. It is easily accessible by removing the back lid with only 3 screws. You would also get a 256gb M.2 drive which is blazing fast. My system turns on and starts up Google Chrome in less than 16 seconds and that is impressive. You would also get the latest 3.0 USBs and 2.0 USB ports with the newer Type-C connector and of course an HDMI port. There is really nothing else to ask for in this laptop. It comes with a lot of features for an extremely low price. I ended up buying 2 of these laptops since i saw how quick they are selling out. Oh and lets not forget the extremely long battery life this laptop comes with out of the box with max brightness i was able to get around 8 hours of life.,0

February 8  2017By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Excellent Laptop for the Money. Searched long and hard before choosing this laptop - had it for about 2 months now with no problems at all.Dedicated video card lets me play World of Warcraft and Eve Online at high settings with excellent framerates. Came with an empty second Hard Drive bay that was plug in play to add another Sata Laptop hardrive. Installed in seconds removed like 5 tiny screws inserted the new drive and doubled my space. The i7 processor is wicked fast lets me run AutoCAD with multiple Firefox tabs open while editing word and excel documents all at the same time with no problems. Be aware it is a Matte screen which is perfect for gaming in sunlight (no glare) but if you are used to one of the UHD type screens it will look a bit faded in comparison. There is also a trick - in the bottom right use the Nvidia Control Panel to utilize the dedicated video card otherwise the laptop defaults to the integrated Intel chip for most operations. I use the dedicated Nvidia card for the gaming and CAD stuff and let the intel chip run the rest.*Note - this is a real computer not like those other Amazon listed scams that are too good to be true where the folks ask you to pre-approve your email before making you buy with gift cards or whatever.,0
Laptops,B01LD4MGY4,Acer Aspire E 15 15.6 Full HD 7th Gen…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       This is the first Windows laptop I've purchased in over a decade and I'm pleased with it  December 16  2016By Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Given the cost of this laptop I give it five stars. My only real complaint is the trackpad has a flimsy feel to it otherwise the build quality is decent for a laptop in this price range. It's not as solid feeling as a Macbook but it's also less than half the cost in most cases. This is the first Windows laptop I've purchased in over a decade and I'm pleased with it.Much to my surprise there was next to no pre-installed bloatware or trial-ware on this laptop. There are two Acer programs used for general maintenance and adjusting the screen a trial for MS Office and that was it outside of the smaller apps that come with Windows 10.  I expected to spend lots of time uninstalling all kinds of nonsense and was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to. There is also no pre-installed anti-virus software (aside from Windows Defender) and no other pop-ups promotions or anything else. It basically ships as if you did a fresh install of Windows yourself.After getting the requisite updates from Windows and nvidia (which I recommend doing before Xmas if you're gifting this to a child) and configuring it to my liking this laptop is smoking fast thanks to the latest i5 and SSD. In this price range I was unable to find a laptop with a 7th gen CPU SSD and dedicated GPU. I recommend this one.,0

November 29  2016By Julian Pardenilla,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,5/5 Stars as of 12/6/16The bugginess of the track pad seems to have disappeared completely. The laptop is still a finger print magnet and is still very snappy so I can't wait to add more ram. Does not seem to heat up much however I have not put it under much load. Battery life is good but I wish it was better. I'm switching from a Chromebook so of course the trackpad and battery life doesn't feel as nice. Other than that great laptop. Time will tell.4/5 Stars as of 11/29/16This review is my first impressions after having it for about 5 hours.This laptop arrived as expected. All hardware specs and everything as you would expect. The build quality is great considering the specs and price. The laptops black surface is a fingerprint magnet for me and yes it bothers me for you it may not. Sadly this laptop isn't popular enough to have any good accessories made for it like skins/covers. I under estimated how big this laptop would be because this is my first laptop. Definitely would be some trouble if you plan on using this for school or as a portable machine. Then again no rating reductions for this because it's to be expected if you actually read product specifications. So far the laptop has been nice and snappy.I'd like to adress one of the reviews that gave this laptop One Star. I don't believe this laptop deserves one star for a simple trackpad issue. When I got this laptop the first thing I did was update Windows Windows Defender and the GeForce drivers. I only noticed the laggy cursor until after I had updated everything. If anything this is a hardware/software issue on Acers part so yes it deserves some type of reduction of rating but the cursor performs *perfectly* once you use a mouse. At least mine did. The issue actually is exactly how this reviewer described it however. Freezing and laggy. It goes away time to time (after using my mouse then switching back to the trackpad) but for the most part it comes back.I believe (or hope) that Acer does fix this software issue for the trackpad. Even though I use a mouse it is inconvenient to be handicapped to a mouse. Well don't get me wrong the laptop is not UNUSABLE with the laggy cursor it is just very annoying and should not be happening.,0

Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        523 of 546 people found the following review helpful       Chromebooks aren't just for surfing the internet.  November 7  2015By EDL_Photographic,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,My title at work is Technology Architect. I have experience with Apple Mac Windows PC Android Linux PC Chromebook Solaris PC and various enterprise computer solutions. This may be more technical than most people want.TL;DR/BLUF This thing will do everything your PC will do. And the battery lasts longer.Details* The body of this device is well built the case is all metal. The only plastic is surrounding the hinge.* I forget to plug this in all the time. I am using it all the time and it will easily last a work day for me.* The Keyboard is a chiclet style which I love. It is a bit small for my fingers but not overly uncomfortable. When it is in tablet mode it is disabled which is a nice feature. And an onscreen keyboard is available. the key presses are the right depth and response. It is not easy to get hair in between the keys.* The screen is glass. I can see the screen all the way to 180 degrees. I have hairy pets and the screen collects fur almost as much as my couch. It also collects fingerprints because it is a capacitive touch screen. The touch screen has been very responsive. However hitting the small little X to close a tab in chrome with my big fingers does not always work.* Touchpad is responsive but not too responsive. On the ASUS T100 hovering my thumbs over the keyboard caused mouse movements. That does not happen with this device. The multifunctions work well. Duel fingers for right clicking etc.* I rarely use this as a tablet but the function is there and the OS flips smoothly.* Office tools I use the google tools found in the store. While on the plane or in places with not internet I use the offline mode which allows me to continue to work. And then I can share the documents easily with drive. Once I got used to this workflow I never want to go back to endlessly emailing documents back and forth.* Citrix is able to be installed and I am able to use both Virtual Applications and Virtual Desktops. This means I can access all the applications and desktops that my company and the companies I advise provide me to work in their environments.* VMware I have not tested this fully. I have just gotten it installed and will be testing with the new client that uses VMWare for virtualization* Azure. Haven't test. I will for Ignite in the Spring.* Kindle Since I travel a lot I like to read on the flights. I usually get a book for the trip. And the Kindle app works great even when there is no wifi on the flight. I haven't tested the google books app yet because I really like Amazon's book system.* ChromeOS The Chrome OS is simple to get used too. They have kept it similar to Windows. One thing I'm not sure I like or understand is only having apps on the taskbar and not on the desktop screen. I firmly believe this OS is one to watch. Most likely the new OS for Enterprise environments. Oh yeah I am on the google canary versions so I get to play with the latest OS versions. It is easy to setup. And I don't experience too many crashes.* I have a network cable to USB adapter that I use to connect to wired internet access. Works great.* I have a USB to serial adapter that I use to connect to console ports on Cisco routers and switches that works great with the Beagle app to administer network devices.* I have google fiber and the built in AC wifi card will not give me full speed. I think this is a software restriction. Ping is 2mbs down is 155mbs up is 160mbs. On 5 ghz its range is about 15 ft. on 2.4 ghz it is considerably more. It is easy to proxy many easy to access features in the WIfi interface. I haven't tried changing the MAC address yet. May have to do that.* I use google music with a bluetooth headset to listen to music and books to drown out the other cubes at work. I also connect my phone and my phones headset. I use Airdroid to control the phone and make phone calls. The pairing is easy to do. takes a couple of clicks to turn on and off. I keep it off when not in use for security reasons. The range is around 50 meters.* Since my old profession as Photographer is now my hobby I want to be able to edit photos. The built in gallery tool is OK. But the Polarr app is very very good. It can do almost the same as photoshop and gimp. There is also Pixl webversion. But I'm not as big of a fan. It is missing software that works like Lightroom. I am still learning things. It may be able to do it.* Since I really like linux I setup Kali Linux on Crouton on a micro-sdcard  in the built in micro-sdcard slot. TF-card for those outside the US. The first time I did it I used a slower 64gb card. It worked but it had weird delays. The Lexar micro-sdcard 10 with the faster read writes fixed that.I also used the crouton extension and switching from chromeos to Kali is easy. One problem I did run into was adding external wifi cards. The Alfa AWUSO36NHA and the TP722 are not recognized. I haven't solved that problem yet.* Chromecasting does work. Both on the new and old chromecast. But don't use those regularly. add the extension for the browser and away you go.* an add on for ssh is there.* ctl+alt+t gets a crosh shell which is good only to get to shell which is enabled in developer mode. Google developer mode to see if you want that.* The Rockchip cpu is great. I've used it in the past.* HDMI to VGA adapter works great with external montiors projectors and TV's.* I highly recommend the 4 gb ram version.* One drawback to the keyboard is that it is not backlit and that sucks surfing the web at night* One really nice thing is that once things are signed in all the google stuff integrates and pulls everything you setup with google. You don't have to spend days installing things that were setup on old workstations. Google takes care of that for you. Granted there is a price for that. The price is privacy. Google keeps track of everything. So far Google has a been a good steward of our data; so I am trusting.* Mentioned a lot of technical stuff that this Chromebook can do because people think that is only able to connect to the internet and good for surfing the web. It does that and does that extremely well. But I wanted to point out that it is a fully functioning PC that can replace any PC out there. As a matter of fact it will replace most PC's eventually.,0
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        141 of 146 people found the following review helpful       Never going back to Windows again.  ChromeOS can be a very powerful / cost effect utility if understood and used creatively =)  July 21  2015By Timothy W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Update - WiFiOk I've checked the WiFi connectivity of my primary unit and the second one I got for my better half.  Both function at my place and my parent's place.  So I'm pretty sure it's the bogus WiFi at my place of work =/I'm relieved that it's not a fault with my C100.  Yay Asus!Update - 08/19/2015This thing continues to impress.  I've set up Chrome Remote Desktop to remotely access my now only windows PC (gaming) and it works flawlessly.  I'm able to run windows applications in house from my desktop easily and setup was a snap.  Kudos to Google for provided a very solid remote desktop solution.  I've also ran games like WoW and Hearthstone on my C100 using this method for poops and giggles.  It worked surprisingly well especially hearthstone.  All that's required is an internet connection.  I may actually re-purpose some hardware and build an ESXi server and virtualize a 'working environment' solely for Chromebook access.  VMware VSphere has a web client so I think I'll be able to directly access virtual windows/linux directly from my Chromebook without the need to first use Chrome Remote Desktop.Very pleased with my purchase.  I will definUpdate - 08/03/2015I'm still loving my C100.  I went out of town on a trip and this guy kept me connected no problem.  Now that I'm back and back at work (day job) my C100 has issues connecting to the company WiFi.  I've never had issues in the hotel on the road connected via phone wireless hot spot and at home.  My job's network does leave a lot to be desired though so that may have something to do with it.  I've tested by putting my phone in Wireless Hot Spot mode and it connected flawlessly.  I'll try on my home network and report back.  I'm assuming it's just the crummy WiFi at my job but wanted to report it here anyways.  Other than that this thing still rocks and still looks brand new!  I have two of them in the house and I've all but replaced all Chromebooks with these models at my company.  I'm SO sad that the 4GB model is sold out!  I love these so much I wanna grab a few more for my folks and siblings!  Please Amazon/ASUS; please bring more in stock!I also noticed that the price for the 2GB model dropped!  I'm loving the new prices of $229 and $259 for the 2GB and 4GB models respectively.  Making a great product even better with at those price points!Also to those who've received models that had issues - not everything is perfect off the line.  QA usually just tests a percentage in a batch before signing off for the batch to go out the door.  I've seen it in Acer HP Dell Alienware and others for years.  It happens sucks but it happens.  I love Amazon in that they offer a very generous return policy.  Prime is even better!  But I digress - I'd happily and probably will buy a few more of these Asus C100s in the 4GB variant.Update - 07/29/2015I'm still very VERY pleased with this machine. I was originally concerned with the performance of the processor but I've been multitasking like a mad mad.  Yesterday I held a video hangout with a family member for the better part of 3 hours.  No problems or hiccups.  We were able to video chat with ease while I continued to check email read articles and then ended up presenting desktops to go over his numbers to start his own business.  All done from my little ASUS C100.  ASUS really did a bang up job on this little guy.  And I'm always getting complements when I pull my C100 out around friends and family members.  One individual thought this was a Mac Book of some kind!  That is until he spotted the Chrome emblem.  He's a die hard Apple guy and he was geeking out over my little C100 and the fact I only paid $259 for it (4gb model).  I think I'm good with this guy for the next long while.I've been eye'ing the Nexus 9 but the LTE model is $499!  Add the keyboard folio for $125-135 and you get a similar experience to the laptop/tablet functionality of an ASUS C100 without the touchpad for $624!  I'd still love a Nexus Tablet but for that price I can definitely wait.  The C100 has my back until then =)AMAZON / ASUS - Add more 4GB models to stock so that I may start phasing out all my other company CB's with the ASUS C100!  And purchase them for friends and family!  Best gift ever!  For yourself or otherwise!Update - 07/24/2015I've used the C100 for a week now for personal and business use.  So far I've been able to do all my personal stuff (surfing email web vids Netflix/Hulu/etc both on the C100 and cast to my 70"" flat screen via Chromecast) and everything works really well.  I've not noticed any more stutter than what I'd come to expect on my Acer C720P - not much stutter at all.  I've also conducted various video conferences hangout chat rooms with family and employees drafted policies and procedures and company letters converted docs to PDF filled out other PDFs and signed them and all this on my C100 alone.  It performs very well and will be my go-to machine for anything I may happen to need.  I also have VMs built to provide additional functionality and this device performs great in that regard too.  I'm loving the solid aluminum build keyboard and screen.  Tablet mode is a God send when I have lengthy reports to read through as I can find a comfy spot on the sofa in my lounge and read with my feet kicked up.  I already received my second C100 4GB model from Amazon - it'll probably go to my better half.  This has become the gift I get people for its affordable price and solid build/performance.I even played a bit of Cut the Rope (albeit in web format) but it was STILL fun and surprisingly fluid!  Not for hard core Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt gaming however but more android based games are going web now so I think for casual gaming (like you do on your phone) this thing is as solid as any other Chromebook out there.  Plus Google ARC is in beta so it's just a matter of time before we start seeing all those android games/apps we know and love start populating the Chrome Web Store.Original Review:I can't say enough good things about this device.  I pre-ordered the 4GB and received it in the mail Sunday July 19th.  Shipping was fast as always w/ Prime and the device was well packaged.  ChromeOS boots up in SECONDS on this thing.  It might be a tad slower than my Acer C720P but that's driven with a Haswell Intel processor.  Still this Rockchip proc w/ 4GB of ram are still snappy and I find the difference between my two chromebooks negligible.  Power efficiency is a vast improvement over my C720P and that thing has an awesome battery life!  I essentially can now leave my home without worrying about bringing the included charger for my C100.  However the charger for the C100 is also way smaller than that of my C720P so it's even lighter/easier to stuff in my bag and bring with me if I want.This thing is a blast in laptop AND tablet mode - something I didn't really expect but was pleasantly surprised with.  Everything works as advertised and works well.I've migrated away from Microsoft products due to the expense hardware requirements and vulnerability surface area that is inherent in MS.  I find I do a lot of my computing on the web via Software as a Service (Gmail Google Calendar Google All Access Hangouts Docs Sheets etc.).  I also own my own business dealing in real estate investments and have migrated my entire enterprise and data away from MS products and onto Google Apps Unlimited.  With that business solution I have UNLIMITED cloud storage that I can use for literally any kind of data - Software Pictures Videos Presentations Documents any kind of data.  My employees now have work Chromebooks instead of laptops my IT guys have it made with easy domain/device management desktops have been converted to either Chromeboxes and Chromebases and soon Chromebits and I've saved a small fortune in hardware/software costs!  I've not missed MS or the traditional PC at all as 90% of what we all do can be done via web solutions - the cloud (both personal and business) being the heart of everything and our devices (phones tablets laptops desktops and even displays like stand-alone monitors and TVs via Chromecast and soon Chromebit for full on ChromeOS desktop experience) acting as an extension of that heart.  But I digress...The ASUS C100 is an awesome addition for anyone looking for a lightweight machine to surf the web answer email schedule meetings (calendar) hold chats with 1 or more people (Hangouts) video/voice telecons (also Hangouts).  Chrome apps/extensions can be installed via the Chrome Web Store to enhance your experience and the Android App Runtime for Chrome is out in beta now so it's only a matter of time before we see android goodies on the web store as well.  I believe Evernote is already available for chrome now with the new runtime.I should also note that the last 10% of things that I can't do native on the Chromebook I can do via Platform as a Service.  I'm also a developer and require the use of CAD for some rehab/construction projects (though not usually).  I can work from my chrome product via Google Cloud Platform - it's essentially a VM or series of VM's on the Cloud that runs whatever you want (Windows and AutoCAD/AutoDesk).  All of the heavy lifting and processing are done on the cloud back end and your chromebook/box/base/bit acts as a front end display and control interface.  Yes you need an internet connection to do this kinda work but when will you EVER be without internet?  I walk down the street in any direction and my phone goes off with all kinds of WiFi access points.  I dare say you may even be able to do hardcore video editing.  The cost of PaaS is relatively insignificant when compared to hosting all your services in-house.  Believe me I've been there - never EVER wanna go back.So there you have it - Bottom line this thing rocks.  I'll be placing an order for another one for my fiance and possibly another for a gift for my little brothers graduation.",0

Have always thought the build quality was good and the small size makes them great to travel with.I love getting a new computer but HATE moving everything I need from the old one to the new one and usually only move some things until I get impatient and give up always leaving some good stuff behind while some of the stuff I end up transferring is junk If my house was kept like my hard drives are I would be called a hoarder HD maintenance is not something I really do until a crisis happens....sound familiar?With that in mind I decided to give a Chromebook a shot. 99.8% or maybe even more of my computer time is online I've been saving all kinds of stuff on Gdrive for years....(yup I really need to clean up my Gdrive too)  Having a OS that is built around the cloud and online life sounded just right to me. So I started reading the reviews on current chromebooks.Ok let me get this out of the way I've had personal computers since the 80's even use to write my own programs back then....but I am FAR FROM a power-user and the most taxing game I play is Angry Birds. I mainly surf and store. I file most of my important documents in a cloud for easy access using android programs like CamScan to scan them with my phone then upload to the cloud. I research everything new I buy on the web first I scan important receipts and put them in the cloud download manuals to the cloud and yes store pictures in the cloud. I've found maintaining my data on my desktop my lapbook my tablet and my phone to be way to much so moving it all to the cloud seems like the thing to do. Sure I do wonder sometimes how safe my info is on Gdrive but I've never had a problem or read about anyone having a data loss or data stolen from Gdrive when setup correctly. Sure I've read about others concerns but not about actual losses. My experience on my own PC's Hard Drives however is quite different. I've had several HD crash and not been able to recover the data I've lost a laptop in a rental car I've had one stolen and I've been hacked before so I've decided to put my faith in those cleaver Google folks to maintain my data. I'm not blind to the fact that Google probably mines info from my data stored on Gdrive I don't really care if they know what my income was for the past 10 yrs or my blood-test labs or where I vacationed in 2010 as long as they do not share data that would personally identify that data with me and I trust them not to do that. So on to the Chromebook purchase.I was not set on purchasing the Asus C100 until after about a week of reviewing on line. Then I visited BestBuy I was looking for the chromebooks in the display of laptop/net books they had the sales reps were around me showing others the differences between the units. When one approached me I told them I saw they displayed some ASUS laptops did they have the ASUS C100 Chromebook Flip on display his response was well if we do it would be on the table over there pointing to a 6' fold up table with some units on it then he quickly turned and walked away. I walked over to that table and there was a selection of about 8 Chromebooks with minimum information about them. No Asus C100. I spent probably 20 min looking at them durring that time had several other customers join me looking at them but the sales help noticeably steered clear of the Chromebook display. I find this to be quite common in new technology products retailers fail to hire or train sales that are enthusiasts of those products until they are mainstream. Just go out and try to talk to a Nissan salesman about their Electric car the Leaf or a Chevy salesman bout the Volt or heck even Toyota bout the Prius you'll find if you have spent anytime at all on the web researching it you know way more than the sales person. I then went to Office Depot...not a single chromebook there Sam's club...nope not one so I tried Walmart....BINGO...Walmart had several  Chromebooks on display and info cards that provided the basic info (More than BestBuy). I noticed they were sold out of a few and a slot with the ASUS C100 info card was missing the display unit. I scanned the barcode on the display card in the Walmart App and it said they had several in stock so I found a employee ahowed him the app and ask if he would check their stock. Well they had just got 10 in he unlocked the storage locker under the empty display and pulled one out. I ask when they would have a unit on display the answer was probably tomorrow or the next-day but Walmart had a 15day return pollicy on them so If I wanted to check it out just buy it....I did.The C100 Chrome Flip I purchased at Walmart was a 2gb unit with 16gb solid-state storage. I took it home and unpacked it. I was imitatively impressed with the build very nice Aluminum case incredibly light nice keyboard and track-pad. 2 USB-2 ports a mini HDMI port (no HDMI cable included) a MicroSD card slot a headphone jack and a funny little charging port that looks mike a micro USB but unfortunately is not. A small power button and a volume toggle button. Included in the box is the chromebook a 110v charger that looks like the typical cell phone charger a small few page getting started pamphlet and a registration pamphlet.After unpacking I tried to power up the C100nothing. So I unwrapped the included charger an took a look at it. Its quite small like a typical cell phone charger with a small square block with the 110v ac plug protruding out of one side (unfortunately fixed they do not fold in) and a cord of aprox 6 feet long and the diam of a typical USB charging cable permanently attached opposite the plug ending in a small rectangular mini plug that looks kinda like a cross between a micro and mini USB but is not either. The charger has ASUS stamped in clearly on two sides (nice so you wont confuse it with other similar chargers) and the spec's printed on it of INPUT: 110-240V~ 0.5A 50-60 Hz  OUTPUT: 12V (dc) 2A.  Attached to the cord is a handy Velcro strap to manage the cord.I plugged in the charger and the C100 powerd right up. Its been a few weeks so I may not remember the initiation processes exactly but it was very brief and mainly included selecting the wifi connection and signing into my Google Account....(Gmail).I was impressed with the display. Very clear crisp and plenty bright as bright or brighter than my Samsung 10.1 Tablet. The keyboard feels good I'm still getting use to the keyboard size as I'm coming off a 15.6 laptop with a full size keypad I just seem to miss a few of the outlying keys when touch typing now and then. The keyboard layout is different keys at the top are not labeled F-1 thru F12 like PC keyboards they have symbols on them of their use. (I like it). Like the C100 itself the keyboard is designed for online use there are dedicated keys that will scroll you up and down left and right back and forward browser buttons a search key a key to lock the unit all very handy. The touch pad is responsive and has the typical pinch to size and push to click that we are all familiar with.Display--Touchscreen...this was a Have To Have for me so many applications and process are being built around touch screen input that I feel your buying a handicapped unit if it dose not have a touch screen. The C100 touchscreen works great just as wall as my Samsung tablet or note phone I did find my finger did not slide across the glass quite as smoothly but it was hardly noticeable and after adding a screen protector it became unnoticeable.  Even just browsing while stretched out on the sofa or in bed I find I use the touchscreen to navigate while resting the bottom of the keyboard on my chest and the screen at eye-level. Then when the C100 is in the tablet position the touch screen is ofcourse the only input.EASEL POSITION: When you flip the screen past the 180 deg position the keyboard is deactivated and your input changes to the excellent touch screen. When required a onscreen touch keyboard will pop up for data entry it works quite well. Where the C100 really shines is when you flip it around to about 240 degrees and set it on a flat surface like a table (EASEL MODE) to use the touch screen watch video's or listen to music. When in this position the keyboard is facing outwards on the back side but it is deactivated so it wont respond to your fingers hitting the keys when holding the unit in the inverted position. The speakers that are located on the underside of the keyboard are now facing front so the Easel position is a great position to watch video's.BATTERY: WOW the C100 really shines here I can use it for hours and hours on end even watching Netflix or Dish Anywhere and I've yet to run out of battery during the day. I'm guessing 19-11hrs...really. The battery is built into the unit not sure I like that as batteries do diminish but this is not uncommon in many devices these days.  Charging time seems to be less than an hour to 100%. The unit is a 12V dc unit. I really wish it would be 5v and charge on the same micro usb chargers most new phones and devices charge on it would be one less charger to keep up with and travel with but its not it is however much smaller than the typical netbook ""brick"" charger. I checked on replacement chargers and they are not cheap about $35 car chargers are avail for about half that.ANDROID APPS: The C100 line now have access to the ANDROID Play Store as of now you need to put the C100 in developer mode...very easy to do and you can reverse back to standard mode quite easily. The advantage of having access to Android Apps is huge. While the Chrome Store has some apps and quite a many Chrome Extensions they pail to the universe of Android Apps. Now I can share and sync the same android apps I use on my android phones and tablets. Everyone I've tried so-far has worked. See 2gb vs 4gb below.MUTABLE USERS / SECURITY: The beauty of the chromebook OS is its security. With the exception of Android Apps everything is geared around being online and cloud storage when you sign off the chromebook that info is no longer on you unit most of the info on your unit is wiped except things like the wifi connection and user ID's. I've read this is why the cromebook OS is so secure and not nearly as vulnerable to virus and key loggers. If owner allows anyone can sign into the chromebook as a guest and access the net but not the owners info. Others can also setup and access their Google accounts from the chromebook too.STABILITY & LAG: I've found the C100 to be very stable no crashes as of yet and even right now I have 10 tabs open with no lag.VIDEO: I downloaded the Netflix and Dish Anywhere apps and watch programs on the C100 frequently. They play as well as the best of my other devices....no problems here.REMOVABLE MEMORY: Ive added a 64gb high speed (95 MB/S) MicroSD card to my C100 Ive not used it enough to comment on its usefulness however the reason I added it was for storage of Android Apps and their data. I did have to format the card on the C100 for it to properly work.C100 2GB vs 4GB: The unit I purchased from Walmart was a C100 with 2GB system memory it worked fine a little lag time when having more than 4 or so tabs open not much just a little. From what I have read 2GB is plenty for the existing Chomebook OS however with opening up Chromebooks to the Android Apps the future may require more system memory. I know I'll be installing a lot of Android apps so I checked Amazon for the C100 with 4GB it was available on prime and just $16 more than the 2GB unit I purchased at Walmart. I don't really like to return stuff on a wim but I justified it to myself that had the unit been on display at Walmart I would have noticed it was 2 GB version I also was incurraged to buy it to see it instead of the CSR just opening it at the store. If Walmart had stocked the 4GB unit I would have exchanged them not that I don't love Amazon I feel it just have been fair.I highly recommend the C100 for the $16 its a no brainier to go with the 4GB version. Since I plan on traveling with the C100 I purchased the Chromebook a PNY Elite 64GB MicroSDXC card iLLumiShield - Asus Chromebook Flip Screen Protector &iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 10.1-inch ASUS Chromebook Flip C100PA.While the cover kinda diminishes the beautiful C100 aluminum case it will make it survive being thrown into my work bag or being knocked around in the car with out scuffs and scratches.Well if you have got to this point I hope my review helps your decision.

Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        215 of 228 people found the following review helpful       The Asus Chromebook Flip is the perfect travel device  November 3  2015By Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"ASUS Chromebook Flip 10.1-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen (Rockchip 4 GB 16GB SSD Silver)This review is for the Asus Chromebook Flip 4 GB RAM modelI've been using Chromebooks for quite a while and have purchased various HP and Asus models for members of my family.  I also use a Windows 7 laptop for work and a Windows 10 desktop at home for a home theater PC (which I also access remotely from my current Chromebook laptop the Toshiba Chromebook 2 (4 GB RAM/HD Screen model) and two other Linux (Ubuntu and Mint) machines.I like the idea of Chromebooks for general purpose computing for the following main reasons:- Fast operation - pop them open and be working in seconds- Best battery life of any OS- Safe and secure no viruses adware etc.There are a some things that Chromebooks are not great at like editing video but honestly I do very little of that and have several other more capable machines that I use for those few times a year when I need to edit videos.  One thing that has really improved with Chrome OS is the availability of photo editing apps like Pixlr which are excellent and work offline.I used to have an iPad but found it too limiting.  I replaced that with a Nexus 7-2013 and although it has been a great device it is just too small and is really not great at doing real work.  This has been my go-to device for flying however and I have a bluetooth keyboard cover for it that works reasonably well but the keyboard is tiny and hard to type accurately on.I am replacing the Nexus 7 with the Asus Chromebook Flip.  The Flip is in my opinion more of a competitor to the iPad and other larger tablets than it is a competitor to most other Chromebook laptops.  Having said that it is a terrific little laptop that has a very usable keyboard.  Where it really shines though is as a ""tablet with a keyboard"" that happens to work very well positioned as a laptop.I am most impressed with the solid construction of the Chromebook Flip.  For <$300 you are getting a device that feels as solid as an iPad costing more than twice as much.  The Flip can do everything that an iPad can do but is also a real computer with USB ports a micro SD slot a micro HDMI video port and a built-in excellent keyboard and trackpad.  Flip it into tablet mode and it becomes an easy to hold tablet for reading Kindle books or playing games.Here are some of the things I've found the Chromebook Flip excels at:- Working in Google Docs converting PowerPoints to Slides and giving presentations using the HDMI output (I purchased a micro HDMI to standard HDMI adapter)- Running the Evernote Android app and taking notes during meetings. (I wish Evernote would create a Chrome app but until they do the Android app works well)- Running CRD (Chrome Remote Desktop) to remote into my Windows and Linux machines. The Flip's Rockwell processor is plenty powerful enough to smoothly run these remote sessions.- Running Wake-on-Lan app to remotely wake up the machines I need to access- Accessing GoToMeeting's on the go.- Watching movies and videos (I have a 64GB card to hold movies and TV shows for viewing on an airplane)- Using a stylus to annotate PDF files and for drawing in Google's drawing app. (The touch screen works really well on the Flip seems as sensitive as an iPad)- I use this device and Google Sheets to type my presentation notes when doing speeches or Webinars - it is perfect for this.I purchased the Logitech M557 Bluetooth mouse and it works well with the Flip. The Windows button brings up the Chrome OS App Launcher and the other buttons perform as expected.I recently took a one week trip to Europe and this Chromebook was invaluable on the plane - I read Kindle books and watched movies and TV shows that I had put on the SD card the entire way and the battery held up throughout 8+ hour flights.I usually would write some pros and cons but honestly I cannot think of any cons for this device.",1
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        136 of 146 people found the following review helpful       I spent a month with this laptop  here's a detailed review.  November 27  2015By Val,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,[Body]Just a couple of years ago a lightweight ultraportable laptop with an aluminium shell and an IPS touchscreen for less than $300 would have been unthinkable. So how about Asus Chromebook Flip priced at only $239? That’s pretty crazy considering what you get for the money. Although I would insist on paying extra $40 for the version with 4 GB of RAM - in the long run it’s probably even a better deal. With most of its shell made of aluminium save for the plastic hinge the laptop is surprisingly pleasant to hold to carry in one hand even simply to look at when it rests on a coffee table. Of course nice and pretty laptops have been around for many years but usually they have also had unattractive or outright scary price tags. With a few mild compromises the Flip breaks this tradition and in that sense attracts even more quite literally - you just wanna pick it up open and play with it. Its size might have something to do with it there’s certainly some cuteness to the feel of a miniaturized “adult laptop” that it gives. It even manages to offer two full-sized USB 2.0 ports a microSD slot and a micro HDMI port.[Display]In short it’s nice. It’s bright with good contrast and rich vivid colors and the viewing angles are wide both horizontally and vertically. Somewhat thick bezels might be slightly disappointing for some people but rarely to the point of being a deal breaker - after all it’s a flip screen so using this laptop in tablet mode implies bezels wide enough to safely hold it with one hand. I’ve seen some negative comments around the web about the display resolution of the Flip which I think is an unfair judgement. It’s 1280x800 on a 10.1” IPS touchscreen (which translates to adequate 149.5 ppi) that fully folds backwards in a laptop that costs less than $300. There are laptops currently sold with 13” or even 15” washed out TN panels “rocking” similar 1366x768 resolution for almost twice the price of the Flip. Hell even the current near $1K MacBook Air 11 still holds on to the same resolution. And many of them don’t offer tablet mode or even touch functionality. Besides that little extra vertical space that you get with 800 lines against 768 lines is beneficial when it comes to web surfing. Point is - Asus Chromebook Flip offers easily one of the best displays in its class for a humble price and only falls behind higher-end tablets. My single gripe would be about its reflectiveness (which is what you get for having a touchscreen) - not a huge deal it’s not crazy reflective but generally I like matte screens more. It is of course a matter of personal preference and some people like glossy panels just fine.[Performance]I was skeptical about the Flip’s quad-core ARM CPU from Rockchip. While I still believe that ARM belongs in phones and tablets (at least today) I have to say that most of my concerns are gone. First of all this thing is thin and very light it’s fanless and absolutely silent. There are other fanless Chromebooks with Intel chips on the market but so far none of them offer the same build quality with the Flip’s size and weight to battery life ratio or better performance. And its performance should be perfectly sufficient for most casual users - you can breeze through daily tasks like checking email social networks messaging typing documents making video calls listening to music watching videos or doing basic photo editing - and that is essentially what the majority of people do on their laptops. With the 4 GB RAM version I manage to have a few Chrome apps like TweetDeck and Google Play Music running at the same time while jumping between several tabs opened in the browser without any problems. I’ve been stress-testing this little laptop quite harshly and made it stutter when I was intensely “travelling” through Google Maps in street view while keeping a bunch of tabs with heavy websites open one of which was playing a YouTube video. But after I focused on one tab and gave the laptop some time to cache everything things were back to normal. It’s worth mentioning that the bottom side of the laptop got warmer than usual but never reached an uncomfortable temperature. Overall the Flip demonstrates surprisingly solid performance but of course you shouldn't have any unfair expectations of lightning speeds. Sometimes a poorly optimized clunky website would take few annoying seconds before it lets you scroll or click anything on the page but a good chunk of modern web seems to be friendly to lower-end hardware these days. When it comes to video playback the mobile-oriented Mali-T764 graphics processor handles 1080p 60 FPS videos without a problem. Not that it makes much sense to play 1080p videos on the Flip’s screen but you do have the option to connect it to an external monitor or a TV via micro HDMI port. The combination of size form-factor performance and screen quality makes the Flip a great device to enjoy Netflix YouTube or Hulu whether you’re behind a desk sitting on a couch or relaxing in bed. This also makes it a better communication device than larger and heavier laptops that are mostly used on a desk. The wide angle camera makes it great for Hangouts video calls even when you hold the Flip close on your lap. It won’t shock you with the picture clarity but your friends on the other end will see you just fine. It drops the framerate slightly in low light as most cheaper webcams do but it’s still usable. The microphone gets the job done when used indoors but it might struggle picking your voice in certain noisy environments.[Keyboard]Asus Chromebook Flip is also not a bad device for casual productivity. Probably working for several hours on very large documents with a smaller than usual keyboard might not be its best use but anything else it gets done pretty effectively. Other than its size the keyboard feels rather balanced. The keys don’t wobble too much they’re not too hard or too soft and they travel fairly deep. It’s just a bit smaller than what you normally get on a 11” or 13” laptop and unless you have very large hands it probably won’t feel cramped. Most people don’t find it uncomfortable. It’s not backlit so working in complete darkness is not recommended but for the price it is expected. With a little extra care it can also be a quiet keyboard making the Flip even more classroom-friendly or library-friendly if you will. The trackpad traditionally for all Chromebooks is also pleasant to use. Of course because of the size of the laptop it’s smaller as well but still very usable. In my personal experience it’s not quite as sensitive as for example trackpads on Toshiba Chromebooks. But that’s a mild complain which is easy to drop remembering the trackpad is accompanied by the touchscreen. It is certainly times better than anything you’ll find on Windows laptops for a similar or even higher price especially when it comes to multi-touch gestures like two-finger or three-finger taps and swipes. And don’t forget there are two USB ports if you prefer using a mouse.[Sound]The speakers are loud enough… for a tablet. As far as laptops go all recent Chromebooks with 116” screens offer much louder although not necessarily clearer sound. The Flip is great for watching or listening to something in bed at night or in a quiet room but if you live in a city where street noise easily gets inside your home or office you will likely be turning the volume all the way up pretty often and sometimes still struggle to hear everything especially when the media itself is not very loud. Fortunately the little speakers don’t tend to cramp up and crackle when turned to the max. So they aren’t bad per se but don’t get carried away by expectations. The Flip pleasantly surprises when you plug in headphones or an audio system of your choice - for a cheap device it outputs pretty decent sound.[Battery]Thanks to the efficient Rockchip CPU one of the Flip’s strongest sides is battery life. Asus officially promises 9 hours on full charge but that’s a humble call - you can easily make it through 10+ with mild multitasking. If your workflow doesn’t consist of repetitive opening and reloading heavy websites maniacally while playing music in the background you might get even more out of it. Streaming TV shows and movies would typically shorten the battery life by a couple of hours and consuming media offline would affect it even less significantly. As a matter of fact I was watching a movie downloaded to the local storage with Wi-Fi turned off hooked up to the TV via HDMI (with the Flip’s screen turned off) and the OS concluded that it would run like that for 16 hours. What?!? So yeah it’s likely you won’t need to carry the charger in your bag. Speaking of the charger unlike a typical “brick” that come with many laptops this one is pretty small although it could’ve been even smaller if it had a foldable plug. Well no biggie. It’s a 24W unit that outputs 2A and takes a bit longer to charge the Flip than other Chromebooks do with their “bricks” but not too long usually within 2.5 hours. It might explain why the Flip has a proprietary charging port instead of a popular micro USB (type C is out of question since more powerful variants aren’t cheap).[Tablet mode]I would’ve liked the Flip even if it wasn’t “a flip” and couldn’t fold its display backwards. Because it’s so light and well built I would say it’s worth the price even as a regular laptop. And that’s how I use it most of the time - as a laptop with a touchscreen. But the fact that the screen does fold back allowing to use the device as a tablet is pretty amazing. The Flip has volume and power buttons on the side but unlike 2-in-1 devices it doesn’t imply that it’s an actual tablet and can be used instead of one. But it kind of can. Kind of. It’s a convertible after all but also sort of a tablet. Sort of. Chrome OS adjusts its behavior once the keyboard folds beyond 180-degree angle - all windows go fullscreen the multitask button pops up in the system panel allowing you to switch between windows as well as the on-screen keyboard button. Now if you tap in a textbox the keyboard will appear just as it does on any other tablet. It looks a lot like Google Keyboard for Android but doesn’t act like it. For example swiping for quick access to punctuation and special symbols is not present here so you'll have to do more tapping. However it does offer handwriting recognition which requires to be online and recognizes my scrawls properly (at least in English). The touchscreen is fairly responsive but doesn’t quite compare to higher end tablets. For the most part it allows scrolling and pinch-zooming with ease but sometimes heavier websites and apps (like Google Play Music) might get in the way when loading their content or UI elements slower than you can interact with them. Many touch-friendly apps like Spotify Evernote and TweetDeck generally work well. Google Maps web app would zoom and pan but doesn’t fully support touch input only. YouTube in tablet mode works as expected - strictly for watching videos it’s fine but the overall interface of the website is clearly designed for desktop. Netflix in its current visual form is usable but you have to be very specific in what you tap and what and how you swipe. Reading books in Google Play Books (gosh Google’s naming…) is possible but the web app doesn’t support swipes to turn pages instead you have to tap the small buttons. It’s things like that which put the Flip in the “kinda-sorta tablet” category - you can do things like X as long as you’re okay with Y. But given the recent notion of certain tablets desperately trying to replace laptops with a mobile OS for some reason I’m gonna say that the Flip’s concept looks like a better compromise between the two form-factors today. Mostly because it is affordable honest with itself and doesn’t pretend to be anything else. Yes it can act like a tablet on certain occasions but being a Chromebook first its key point is a full-blown no nonsense desktop browser.[Chrome OS and offline capabilities]The operating system has noticeably matured over the years that I’ve been using Chromebooks. No longer it is laughed at or misunderstood by popular tech reviewers and news sources. I presume the reason for this is that at some point they’ve began actually trying it out and using beyond the few days review period. Once you give Chromebooks a chance with an open mind like them or not whether they suit your needs or they don’t you will most likely agree that for the vast majority of computer users they are more than sufficient. The idea that an average user absolutely needs to run a bulky expensive OS riddled with annoying error messages inconvenient updates security holes vulnerabilities to bloatware and malware to simply go online check messages read news watch a TV show talk to family and friends type a document - is outdated and should go away. Chrome OS gets straight to the point of casual daily computing. But it doesn’t make Chromebooks useless for work - more and more businesses adopt Google Apps for Work which makes Chrome OS devices a great option for offices and kiosks. They can save a lot of time and resources with the very low level of maintenance they require. And as you probably already know Chromebooks are taking education market by storm - again because of the affordability simplicity and easy administration. However to this day the common perception of a Chromebook is that they are practically useless without an internet connection which is simply not true. Watching videos and listening to music or podcasts from local or external storage working with documents in Google Docs and Sheets playing games and using apps - all that is possible offline in Chrome OS and the number of offline-friendly apps keeps growing. Printing is done online and requires printers that support Google Cloud Print (many current models do) but in the modern computing world where paper is finally going away this limitation doesn’t feel unacceptable. Maybe it’s the shortage of local storage of Chromebooks that gives the illusion of their uselessness offline but in reality for most people who use Windows laptops or MacBooks the lack of an internet connection very often means pretty much the same as for Chrome OS users. Keep in mind that with the purchase of the Asus Chromebook Flip you also get 100 GB of Google Drive online storage for 2 years and few other goodies from Google. To sum up everything if you’re looking for a compact lightweight well built laptop with a beautiful touchscreen and great battery life then in this price range you’ll hardly find a better deal today.,1

It is extremely lightweight. The unique hingedesign makes it very practical to use. The keyboard while being small is very usable with a minimum oftypos at speed. The touchpad and touch screen are both very responsive and I find myself mostly usingthe screen to scroll because the unit is so light weight. It has a very clear and crisp display which couldbe a little brighter for outside viewing. Only major gripe is that The speakers are not quite loud enough. I feelthe sound level is just a tad under which the average max is for most Chromebooks on the market. That beingsaid I still chose this unit over many others. Wi-Fi connectivity is instant and consistent no drop outs at alland no issues with Wi-fi range at home or in public. Processor speed for this Rockchip is very impressive the4G Ram make a noticeable difference don't settle for a 2G Chromebook you will be sorry when multitasking.I usually have on average just over 8 tabs open at a time with several streaming and several secure connectionsand have zero lag or hiccups. I can't even do that on my I-5 Win 10 PC without hanging up.I use it for endlessstreaming Netflix Hulu Amazon and other media. Also double duty as a lightweight access to work email andlight tasks. MS office for work and Kami PDF convert programs are free for mobile. These take care of most myneeds. Otherwise Chrome Remote to Desktop Extension from Chrome Store provides me with remote accessto my Win 10 PC at home to get started on heavy duty tasks. I use it on the Bus and on the Train. At 10.1 inand just under 2lbs it's barely noticeable in my bag. The aforementioned Acer R11 Convertible comes with afull size HDMI port and 3.0 USB ports is a bit thicker and weighs around 2.6lbs. Great specs but it lost out tothis Asus because of the portability almost 9hr battery life speed and Screen which is much sharper andclearer than most budget Chromebooks. I am posting Octane 2.0 and Wifi- access speed tests in photos.(This is my 2nd unit. First unit was purchased at discount from Amazon listed as ""Used like new"". Unit wasperfect except Webcam did not work. Returned to Amazon and purchsed new one for $20 bucks more.I fault the seller and not Amazon or Asus.)Recommend.",1
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        87 of 94 people found the following review helpful       A secondary machine that you use a majority of the time.  March 17  2016By Egan Barrs,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Intro:I’ve been using the Chromebook Flip for a little over a week and wanted to share my thoughts on living with it. I’m a college student so I wanted a lightweight chromebook that I can take to campus and use for homework studying and media consumption. This was the first chromebook I found that really caught my attention because of it’s versatility build quality and price.Screen:When I first started considering the Chromebook Flip I was afraid that 10” screen would be frustratingly small when trying to work with several windows open. However after using it as my primary machine I rarely feel like the screen hinders my workflow. I find the screen to be too small to run two windows simultaneously. While you can do it it’s not a pleasant experience and it starts to feel like you’re looking at two phone screens sitting side by side. So instead I set all the windows to full screen and quickly switch between them using the touchscreen.  I never felt hindered using this method. If you want a bigger workspace there is a fullscreen button on the keyboard which removes the lower taskbar tab navigator search bar and bookmarks. Putting the cursor at the top or bottom of the screen or swiping in from the top or bottom with your finger will bring back the bars. This can be useful if you’re only using one window because it makes switching between windows and tabs pretty annoying. I’ve gotten used to the display size so much so that my 4 y/o 15.6” laptop now looks comically big. It’s important to note that my laptop has a 768p display whereas the chromebook has a 800p display. This means that the chromebook has approximately the same amount of screen real estate with the consequence of everything looking smaller.The IPS display has very good viewing angles much better than on my laptop. The screen gets bright enough and dim enough for all the situations I’ve used it for. If you set the brightness to the lowest point it will turn the display off and continue running your programs in the background. That way you can listen to podcasts and music without the display sucking battery.Battery:Battery life has been exceptional compared to my laptop which lasts a measly 1 hr unplugged. The Chromebook Flip is reaching anywhere from 6 to 8 hrs based off my unscientific estimates. I can usually go 2 to 3 days without charging it if I only use it a few hours a day. So far I’ve only once completely drained the battery in one day and that’s because I spent the whole day doing school work with it. It fully charges in about 2 hrs.Performance:I was skeptical of the Rockchip processor since it wasn’t a brand I was familiar with like Intel. However I haven’t had any issues with performance. Scrolling through dense websites can be choppy at first but once all the graphics and ads are loaded it becomes buttery smooth. The chromebook has trouble playing 60fps youtube videos by dropping frames and buffering every few seconds. From what I’ve heard this more of a problem with Chrome OS than the processor itself. Scrolling though long PDF documents (10+ pages) can also be choppy but it’s not at all unbarable. I bought the 4gb model so I cannot comment on the 2gb version.Inputs/Outputs:In my opinion the Chromebook flip comes with the perfect amount of ports. It has two USB 2.0 ports a headphone/microphone jack micro HDMI port and a microSD card slot. My wireless USB mouse connected seamlessly on the first try which is much better than most windows laptops. I do wish the HDMI port was full size but that’s better than not having one at all (looking at you macbook...). The USB ports do provide power so you can charge your phone off the Chromebook even when the Chromebook is unplugged. Chrome OS doesn’t support all file formats. I can play .mp4 without issues but not .avi videos so keep this in mind. If there is a specific file format you depend on go check the list of supported file formats.The chromebook has an extra set of volume controls and an extra power button on the left side of the keyboard half. The volume controls are useful when using the chromebook like a tablet but I’ve found the power button to be completely useless. Pressing it does nothing holding it down locks the chromebook and holding it down even longer shuts down the chromebook. I wish instead that the button locked the chromebook AND turned off the display with a single press much like a traditional tablet.Keyboard/Trackpad:The keyboard and trackpad are both small which should be expected from a 10” laptop. However both are still nice to use and easy to get used to. The keyboard feels nice to type on and the keys have decent travel. Despite the size I am still able to type quickly and accurately. The trackpad tracks well and has a solid satisfying click. Two finger scrolling on the Chromebook Flip is the best I’ve ever felt and is on par with macbooks. It doesn’t support pinch to zoom however zooming can easily be done using the touchscreen.Speakers/headphones:The Chromebook Flip has two downward facing speakers underneath the keyboard. The quality is pretty average. The bass is weak and the sound is pretty tinny when listening to music. However I have no complaints when listening to dialogue from Netfilx or Youtube. My main issue with the speakers is that the max volume isn’t very loud. One day I was in the kitchen cooking with the dishwasher and clothes dryer running while food was sizzling on the stove. All of this combined made it difficult to hear the audio from the chromebook. The headphone quality is good enough to my ear so there is nothing that I find praiseworthy or reprehensible.Versatility:The Chromebook flip can be used in 4 ways: Laptop presentation tent and tablet. I find myself using all of these modes regularly. However don’t expect to get a tablet experience from the Chromebook Flip. Tablet mode is handy when watching video and scrolling through websites but without true apps the experience is severely limited. However it’s still great to have when you want it. Even though Chrome OS isn’t designed for touch screens it handles touch input remarkably well. Using your fingers you can zoom drag and scroll pretty much anything you’re looking at and the OS does so cleanly and smoothly.Once you fold the screen past 180 degrees the chromebook enters tablet mode which forces all windows into fullscreen. A button is added to the taskbar which allows you to see small previews of all your open windows to make switching between them easier. You can also switch between your windows with the taskbar.Conclusion:Convenient is the best word to describe this device. It’s not powerful it’s not perfect and it won’t replace your Windows or Mac machine but it’s so convenient to have around. Because it’s small light and well built it’s perfect for traveling with or taking to campus. It’s much more convenient to walk around the house with this instead of my bulky laptop and its power brick. The aluminum build looks amazing and feels much more expensive than it actually is. I wouldn’t buy this or any chromebook as a your primary machine unless you have very basic needs. However the Chromebook Flip is the perfect secondary machine. If you want apps and games use your phone. If you want to do pc gaming video editing or any other serious work loads use your laptop or desktop. For everything else use the chromebook. That “everything else” adds up to a lot and makes the $269 I spent on it well worth it. The quality and functionality that you get for $269 is unrivaled by any other Chromebook or laptop. The only reason I would recommend a different Chromebook is if you can’t afford this one or if 10” is too small for you.,1
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        32 of 33 people found the following review helpful       (NOT) The best little Chromebook ever!  December 31  2015By Mike P,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"********************* Scroll to end to see why I've downgraded my review of this item from 5 to 2 stars ************************This is the first item that I purchased from Amazon returned it then immediately bought another one! At well under $300 (4G model) these little gems are a great bargain!So why did I have to return the first one I bought? My internal microphone didn’t work. Asus support was good and after a little troubleshooting they said to send it in under warranty or return it to Amazon (I chose the latter). Another common problem that buyers have reported are keyboard malfunctions so if you buy one test each and every key when you get yours. I’m still giving it 5 stars.12 things I like about the Asus Flip 10.1:1. It boots in 10 seconds.2. It’s sleek aluminum case feels like an upscale laptop.3. It’s feather-light so it’s the ultimate portable device for the couch the bed and coffee shops. It barely takes up any space in a backpack or on your side tables. I’m guessing that a woman could easily slip the Asus into many purses and forget it’s there.4. The screen brightness contrast and color will impress you (even at 720p). Most Chromebooks generally have washed-out screens but this one is a joy to look at even at wide angles.5. I’m getting an amazing 9 hours on the battery (more or less depending on tasks). I use this Asus all day long and unlike my other laptops I only charge it when I’m sleeping! (Hint when you’re not working close the lid to conserve even more battery.)6. It is the smallest device with a keyboard that I can comfortably touch-type on (I do have smaller man's hands). The keyboard just feels right. For me typing beats thumbs every time!7. A typical tablet/keyboard combo tends to tippy because tablet outweighs the lightweight keyboard attached to it. Not so with the Flip you can push the screen all the way back and it's not tippy because more weight is in the keyboard component (like most laptops). Nice.8. The touch screen is great. Even in normal laptop mode I find myself routinely using my fingers and thumb to click on links and scroll the screen.  In tablet mode the touch screen works well for me - tapping pinching and typing with the onscreen keyboard with the same ease as my smartphone. (most Chromebooks don’t have a touchscreen.)9. In tablet mode the ability to use a stylus to write or draw was an unexpected bonus. I wrote a good-sized email last night just using my (optional) stylus. The handwriting recognition software is excellent. (Look for the 3 dots left of the onscreen keyboard in tablet mode to switch to pen.)10. I usually use my Nexus 7 for reading but honestly I’m now using the Asus Flip 10.1 to read my books using the Kindle Cloud Reader! Why hold a reader when this petite Chromebook will hold the screen in a convenient L or tent mode for you?11. As a former UNIX System Admin I can testify that the small efficient Linux-based Chrome OS will be robust and largely trouble-free.12. No more big Windows updates to install along with the obligatory reboots. (Then you have to cross your fingers that everything still works.)5 ways that a Chromebook saves money:1. Buy a Chromebook for half the price or less of the average Windows-based laptop.2. Google Play provides the very-usable Google Docs and Sheets apps for free. I’ve written and edited many of my Word and Excel files already with no problems (a few power-user features may not work).3. If you can think of it there’s probably a free Google App for it. I installed and tested Pixlr yesterday a free photo editor. It’s features and interface is very similar to my $100 Photoshop elements (Yes Pixlr has layers and most of the expected tools too.)4. Forget about viruses and paying for expensive virus protection. Chromebooks generally don’t get viruses. (But still remember to use strong passwords and other common sense security measures.)5. No more money spent on the next big Windows upgrade coming or worrying if your system has enough CPU or RAM to run it. Also no more worrying if your expensive favorite apps will work on the next upgrade or perhaps you will need to upgrade your apps too!  Over the years all of the above have happened to me repeatedly. I'm not giving up my expensive Windows system today but it's been turned off now for 3 weeks.The few minor things that I’m not very impressed with:1. I consider the tablet mode a nice-to-have feature that I’ll seldom use. I don’t like holding a 10-inch tablet because it just feels awkward to me (even though the Asus only weighs 2 pounds). Also the keys feel kind of weird to me on the back as a tablet when I’m holding it. (I’m sure that a diehard tablet user would quickly become accustomed to it.)2. As a former HP employee the several hardware failures this model has had in the field does perturb me. There’s simply no excuse to release a product with those problems. Still I’ve been using my second unit for a couple of weeks now with no problems.3. The speakers are weak but I normally use headphones anyway. Realistically I don’t know where the engineers would put better speakers on this little unit and they do need to keep the price low.4. It has no delete key on the keyboard. (Hint: highlight text then hit backspace key.)5. A 1080p resolution screen would be nice but I did not expect that at the low price they are asking for these units.TIPS:1. Enable Google Now so you can do searches just like your Android phone with your voice. Go to your Chrome browser settings then go to the Search section to enable it.2. Buy a Micro SD card to increase your local storage. I bought a 64G card and inserted it (instantly recognized). With nearly all my docs and spreadsheets on Google Drive I doubt that I’ll ever use this storage but it’s nice to know it’s there.3. Enable offline editing of your Google Drive files. This is nice to have for the rare times that you  can’t connect to the internet but you want to view or edit one of your docs. Just open Google Drive then click on gear icon in upper right click on settings then just click the offline checkbox. Now your docs will be available offline too.4. Make a Chrome system recovery image on a USB stick (minimum 4G). Just download the simple Recovery App free from Google Play run it and follow instruction to make the image (very quick). If you ever need to recover you Chrome OS do this: turn off the Chromebook then power on while holding F3+refresh keys and follow instructions to recover your system.5. Buy a Chromecast streaming device ($35) for your TV then Install the free Google Cast extension in the Chrome browser. Now you can browse the web and view any browser tab on your TV a great way to watch any online movies or videos on your big screen. The native resolution of Asus Flip is 720p so that’s what it will cast on your TV. However apps like YouTube have a built-in icon to cast videos at full HD if desired. I also own a Roku 3 but I generally prefer the user interface in a browser when searching and playing videos.If you’ve read this far thanks! Now don’t think about it just go buy this thing. I’ll try to remember to give an update after I’ve had this unit a bit longer.UPDATEI've been using my replacement Asus Chromebook Flip 10.1 for a full month now with absolutely no problems. I'm retired so I use this Asus a lot everyday from dawn to late night and I still only have to charge it when I'm sleeping. The keyboard continues to work perfectly (no failed keys) and the wi-fi has never dropped on this unit. My impressions are still the same too. It's a perfect portable size smaller than any typical laptop but still very easy to type on with a bright sharp screen. The speakers are better than my first impression possibly because when I watch videos in ""L"" mode the speakers face up! My old 7""  tablet stays in the drawer now and my 15"" Win 10 laptop stays mostly turned off. What else could you want?UPDATE April 27 2016 - My Asus Flip 10.1 is still working perfectly and I use it more than ever.UPDATE November 8 2016 - I'm happy to report that my Asus Flip 10.1 (C100PADB02 - 4G model) is still working perfectly. I use use it  regularly from sunrise to sundown with no real issues only charging it at night. Its sleek aluminum skin remains unmarred. Because my Roku apps have limitations I'm now using the Asus Flip even more now to Chromecast video and music to my TV system (e.g. Amazon content and music). My girlfriend decided that she had to have one too so now we are often found together with side-by-side units! At only 2 lbs the form-factor is perfect for couch or bed-surfing!  I'm using Google Docs and Sheets quite often now as free replacements for the expensive MS Office products. My Chromebook hasn't had one virus (OS is locked-down) and it updates in a minute with a quick reboot.UPDATE: Unfortunately I have to downgrade this system to 2 stars because for months now I've had the chronic ""Aw Snap"" problems where browser tabs crash and one must reload them. I've tried ALL the recommended fixes such as: simply reloading the page (tiresome) removing all browser extensions re-installing chrome (simple but tiresome) changing privacy settings closing tabs powering off regularly etc. etc. Asus said if I send it in for repairs they don't guarantee to fix it and research indicates that this is NOT a hardware problem. Chrome support pages simply parrot the above fixes and nothing new has been posted on this for some time now and Chrome users are still suffering with the problem. The consensus is this is a Chrome browser issue as Windows users running this browser also experience this chronic issue. I'm guessing that at some point a Chrome update created this problem as I did not have it in earlier versions of the Chrome OS. I still love this Asus system size and features and the Chrome experience but this ""Aw Snap"" issue is quickly becoming a deal-killer.",1
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,        23 of 24 people found the following review helpful       I bike pretty much everywhere and would throw my tablet in my ...  August 26  2015By Shanklin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,UPDATE no. 4: This may be made of aluminum but it's a soft aluminum. There's a small dents in it nothing serious but this from normal use.UPDATE no. 3.: There is still some weird touch things going on. Touching the thick bezels will activate touch functions like opening a bookmark folder or closing the browser completely. Opening it again gives me an empty tab so I have to open recent tabs to get back where I was. This happens by just grabbing the screen to reposition it just my thumb touching the bezels.I rarely use it as a tablet so not sure any of those issues have returned but there is touch actions going on here from touching the bezels.UPDATE no. 2: Got the replacement and all issues are gone. Seems I did get a lemon.UPDATE: I seem to have got a lemon so sending back and getting another one. The touch issues expanded into trackpad issues. I would get dropdowns without doing anything trackpad would stop working bizarre things would popup. Did a factory reset and no help logged in with a different gmail account and no help. Removed all extensions and no help. So hopefully it's just one of those things a bad unit.Got this two days ago. Got tired of web pages that don't work right on my tablet (what is it with these developers who disable pinch and zoom on mobile? 1 size is not close enough). I bike pretty much everywhere and would throw my tablet in my panniers and head out. So today I took this instead (about the same size) and during lunch whipped it out could zoom on the pages where the idiots disabled it on mobile answered some emails without having to deal with virtual keyboard.I tested it against my tablet and web pages load faster almost without exception.I did encounter a few hiccups with tablet mode. While watching netflix in full screen if I didn't reduce the screen before flipping the keyboard back it got stuck in some weird halfway place. Pressed the power button to logout and after logging in all was well. Duplicated this problem twice.Another time it wouldn't register touch at all but flipped back to out of tablet ok. Had to reboot to get touch back.I'll see how that goes but for now I'm quite pleased with it.,0
Laptops,B00ZS4HK0Q,ASUS C100PA-DB02 10.1-inch Touch…,"        13 of 13 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Chromebook / limited ""tablet""  November 28  2015By AnnieB.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this when my first-gen Samsung Galaxy tablet finally took a dump and stopped working. I thought this laptop/ tablet hybrid would fit the bill well since my home laptop is also aging and slow.  Overall Asus has put out a great product for the price.  It has a sleek solid build quality and moves seamlessly between laptop and tablet mode.  The keyboard is small but functional.  I got the 4G version and it's reasonably quick (slows down once you have 10+ chrome tabs open but that is understandable).  I am able to use the Remote Desktop function to connect to my work laptop so I don't have to take it home on nights and weekends. I love how it props itself up in tablet mode and the screen angle can be adjusted to your liking.  My main complaint about this device is lack of tablet functionality and App support.  I frequently used my Samsung tablet for reading magazine subscriptions via Google Newsstand and the Amazon Kindle App.  None of my subscriptions across either of those platforms work on this device since they are all available only in Android Apps not browser versions of Google Newsstand and Kindle Cloud Reader respectively. Also Google's ""App"" for Google Play Movies & TV is not an app at all and just takes you to the browser site so even though I have purchased content and am able to download it on my device it is useless to me when offline because launching Google Movies just takes me to a browser window that says it can't connect to the internet.  Basically I just don't understand why we can't get native versions of Android apps scaled for the Chromebook OS - without them the tablet feature of this device just feels half-baked.  I guess this is more a complaint about Google support and software for its devices rather than the Asus device itself but this should have been contemplated/ integrated prior to release of this laptop/ tablet hybrid.  I am keeping this Chromebook for home but buying another Samsung tablet for reading magazines and watching media while traveling.",0
Laptops,B008BEYEL8,"Apple 13 "" MacBook Pro / MD101LL/A / 2.5GHz…",        65 of 70 people found the following review helpful       My first and for a long time(hopefully) last Macbook Pro.  May 23  2016By Supamonkey,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"First a shout out to the seller wikrum for sending a laptop that was pretty much like new. There were no scratches or marks of any kind. Considering that I was buying this PC ""used"" I was very pleasantly surprised by the item.Ok so I bought this particular ""late 2012"" model Macbook pro for 2 specific reasons. The first was that my traveling laptop was getting a little long in the tooth and I needed something sturdy yet light (lighter than my 7lbs Dell). My wife has a 2014 Macbook Air but I really dislike using it. The screen feels too wobbly when I type on it and because it inclines thinly towards the front for me its more difficult to put my palms on it and type.  So the Pro seemed like the best fit. But I also didn't want to dish out $1300 for a new Pro  that I knew I'd be putting through traveling stresses as well as risks of damage and theft. Hence the second hand purchase.As a traveling companionhow this guy has fared? I cannot say because my wife has taken the Macbook pro and dumped me with her Air :-(. Apparently she didn't like the wobbly screen of her Air as well and ""Appropriated "" mine. But according to her it runs as well as her(now mine) Air and even gives a decent battery life of 4 hours.The second and more important reason for this particular model is that its the last model that can be easily ""speced"" up by the user without much computer/electronics know how.(I know you can buy higher specs from Apple directly but I'd rather not spend an additional $200 on something that would cost me $30 and 10 minutes)  All the models that have come after this have soldered RAM and weird proprietary pins for the SSDs as well as glued batteries. Since my Windows laptops all have SSDs I've gotten used to lightening fast wake/start of my windows laptops and quicker responses. Since this Pro came with an HD I knew I would have to upgrade it to make sure it would not move like molasses(compared to windows laptops). And With a 10 minute job of installing a 256SSD and 8GB RAM it runs like a champ at least that's what my wife tells me. Its as fast if not faster than her(now mine) 2014 Air.Now I'm not going to go into details of why you should buy a Mac there is plenty of literature for it. I just wanted to tell you why I bought this particular PC. It's pretty sturdy for traveling without fear of sinking $1300 into it and more importantly  if you have the brains to unscrew some screws you can upgrade this Pro to last for the next 5-7 years. (Something you can't easily do with the models that follow it)",0

It was Prime and arrived on the scheduled date. I was concerned from reading other reviews that this might be a used or refurbished computer so I used Amazon Chat and was assured that it would be new.  Amazon sent a transcript of chat exchange to my email and it appears to be accurate and complete.  The computer I rec'd was in a sealed Apple container and is new.Setup went very well; I fumbled a little because this is my first new Mac and my first setup but I was able to complete without assistance. The only glitch that I haven't overcome so far is that I'm not able to live stream television from Comcast using the Chrome browser. It works perfectly with Safari but with Chrome all I get is audio. I'm using the latest Adobe flash player - I think.All that said the computer I received appears to be exactly as advertised and performs as good or better than what I expected. I'll modify this review if I find a problem - keeping my fingers crossed!,0

May 17  2016By Aakshi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After a lot of researching I chose this laptop and am very happy with the purchase.Received it yesterday and I've put this laptop to a whole lot of scrutiny and have barely managed to find flaws.This is most likely going to be a lengthy review although it should hopefully cover all the important things.So after some searching I narrowed down my options to the following 3 new releases -1. HP 15-ay013nr - HP 15-ay013nr 15.6"" Full-HD Laptop (6th Generation Core i5 8GB RAM 128GB SSD) with Windows 102. ASUS F556UA-AS54 ASUS F556UA-AS54 15.6-inch Full-HD Laptop (Core i5 8GB RAM 256GB SSD) with Windows 10 Icicle Gold3. This guyWhile the HP option is cheaper 128GB could fill up pretty soon especially considering I plan to dual-boot Ubuntu and have lot of software I need for work. So I ruled that one out.The ASUS one comes really close in config to this one with the one major difference being that this fellow has a dedicated graphics card and the ASUS one doesn't. But how major is that? I knew GTX 940MX is not even close in performance to GTX 960 and above but believed it should still be faster than the integrated Intel HD 520 and since it is about 15-30 W TDP it shouldn't be too heavy on the battery either. Couldn't find benchmarks online comparing Intel HD 520 and GTX 940MX head to head so I'm sharing some GFXbench benchmarks that I ran to compare the two. Basically 1.5x to 2x improvement in graphics horsepower. Not a lot but better than 1x so games should be slightly better :)Plus I was interested in learning some parallel computing with CUDA considering all the buzz around deep learning. And thus Acer won!Hopefully this was useful information if you were wondering how much extra this dedicated graphics card brings to the table.Now a quick rundown on different features below -Build - This is not aluminium like the Mac nor is this Dell XPS or Lenovo Thinkpad sturdy. It is black plastic but at the same time it does not feel like a cheap build either. For the price it is really good I like the grip. Not too heavy and it's thinner than it appears in the photos. A customer review for the ASUS laptop mentioned that the plastic felt fragile this reinforced my decision to go with the Acer model.RAM - 1x8GB DDR4 is fit in this model while the other slot is empty so you can fit in another 8GB card make it 16 if you want. Although for everyday computing 8GB is plentiful. Plus it has 2GB of GDDR5 memory for graphicsStorage - 256GB SSD is so worth it. SSD makes a whole lot of difference to speed app load times and boot times. Your PC feels so fast you'd never want to go back to the regular hard drive again. Also I found out recently that the SSD in this is an M.2 SSD (Samsung MZNLN256HCHP) and the other hard disk slot is empty. So basically you could buy a 1TB hard drive for like less than $75 and bump up the storage while still having Windows and all your software run from the SSD << This feature makes me like the laptop all the more.Processor - 6200U is a dual core 4 thread CPU. This is less powerful than the 6300HQ i5s found in the more expensive gaming laptops but totally good enough for everyday computing and it consumes much lesser power (<15W) which makes it good for the battery. A single core Geekbench mark of about 2.7k and multi-core benchmark of 5.8k (attached image) is of-course not awesome or anything but more than enough for regular use. I'm also sharing the octane benchmark score - 28k.GPU - As mentioned above GTX 940MX offers between 1.5 and 2x improvement in graphics horsepower and is a low power card so it wouldn't drain your battery. Definitely a nice to have (benchmarks comparing it with integrated graphics attached). Also if you own an Nvidia Sheild device please note that 940MX does NOT support Gamestream.Screen - Pretty good I'd say 15.6 inch is perfect for working on the couch. It's not IPS so viewing angles might not be too high but pretty good nevertheless plus it's got the anti-glare finish. I like it works for me.Keyboard and touchpad - I was a little unsure how comfortable this will be I never liked the extra number pad in laptops which shifts the center towards the left making it all weird to type. But surprisingly it doesn't seem much of a problem in this laptop. Typing is quite comfortable contrary to what I expected. Backlit keyboard is a bonus. The touchpad works fine however sweaty hands make it a little un-smooth.Battery - Excellent battery life. Acer claims 12 hours but I wouldn't hold my breath on it. Expect about 8-10 hours of battery life perhaps 6-8 if you constantly stream 1080p videos. But 6-8 hours of youtube is not bad at all it's awesome in-fact. However note that the battery cannot be plucked out and replaced (this is a con though I wouldn't remove a star for just this)Sound - Now with everything so good about the laptop you'd think there has to be a flaw in at-least the sound right. But Nope! Acer's got this one as well. Don't expect Bose or Beats but for a laptop it is quite loud and clear.I started looking at Macbooks for setting up a work desk at home but after seeing the plethora of Windows options with much better configs for lesser prices decided to go with Windows for work and a maybe a chromebook for carrying around (Acer Chromebook 14 - eyes on you).Very well done by Acer kudos.Update -Ports - has got them all - USB 3.0 USB 2.0 USB Type C HDMI VGA Ethernet SD card reader and DVD drive (always a bonus)Heating - haven't had any heating issues so far can barely hear the fan.Adding a couple of photos to the review one of them shows the thickness of the laptop.",1

Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        487 of 523 people found the following review helpful       Great Job on this one Acer!  May 16  2016By Damian Green,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Spent 14 hours researching what computer I was going to buy before I stumbled upon this one. I think it is the perfect balance between the power and value that you really want from a computer. It really seems to have all of the most basic features you really would like to have in a computer: 4 processing threads running at a decent speed an SSD of decent size for fast boot times sufficient memory (4GB generally works but this has 8GB)  a DVD burner a full HD screen a 12 hour battery life (haven't tested that yet but it seems likely to approach that if you put it in the ""battery saver"" mode multiple USB3 ports bluetooth a LAN adapter both VGA and HDMI connectors that support multiple monitors and what I consider to be very nice extra bonuses include a backlit keyboard and a decent nVidia graphics chip embedded. The only thing this computer is missing that higher end computers have these days is a touch screen display (but who cares? I don't like finger prints on my screen anyway...) and a lot of hard disk space. For an extra $30 bucks though you can buy a fairly fast 128GB USB 3.0 thumb drive that increases the size of your drive to something that would last you a year or two before you run of space or you could just use cloud storage (slow) or buy a micro SD card and use that (medium)  or buy an external drive (medium) for storing all your videos and music. Connect to it over the network even.Anyway the point is I'm really happy with this computer so far. I have only had it for a few days but I've tested it under some heavy programs and it seems to be running smoothly. I also recognize that Acer products often have some bad reviews and in the past I have tended to avoid them but I really think they did a great job with this one.  A++ Acer!And that's my two cents...",0
Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        174 of 187 people found the following review helpful       (Updated 1/1/17) A near-perfect  rather powerful budget laptop  August 9  2016By Mark Schauer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I'm writing this review on this very system so that I can accurately give you all of the information you'll need prior to purchasing. Granted I already can tell you I'm not a fan of the keyboard—but that's not at the fault of Acer; rather I'm not a fan of *any* membrane keyboard. More on this particular keyboard later.Quick summary: No IPS panel grippy trackpad low disk space mushy keyboard great I/O solid performance easy upgradability runs quiet good battery life very light flaky HDD area decent-sounding speakers.Now what kind of person is this laptop suited for? This in my mind is by no means a desktop replacement. Not a chance. Instead it would make for a nice desktop peripheral. It's light and powerful enough that you can take it on the go but I wouldn't expect to render a Full HD video on this thing and have it take less than four hours. Can you comfortably use this with Photoshop? Sure you can. You can even get Vegas up and running on here and with the extra RAM slot being open you can stick another 8 GB in it. I'm not certain what the maximum amount of RAM you can have in here but I heard that you can get up to 32 GB (2x16 sticks) but I cannot verify that.Onto the performance: This laptop has two models that you can choose from here on Amazon. This was the part that confused me the most and it led to much research on my end. You can pick from either the i5-6200U or the i7-6500U. If you're on the edge save yourself the extra $150 and get the i5 version. Why? At this particular price point of $550 you aren't going to notice any difference at all while using it unless you want to save an extra few minutes rendering video. The i7-6500U has a mere 10% performance increase over its i5 counterpart. Both have two cores and four threads. Trust me the i7 is not worth the $150 upgrade or the fancy sticker. The included RAM is 2133 MHz Kingston. To be honest it's rare to find this kind of speed on a non-gaming laptop. RAM speeds don't make much of a difference in real world applications but I was expecting something along the lines of 1600 or 1333 MHz. Also the included SSD is a much-needed upgrade from a standard HDD. It also happens to be a Kingston but I don't have any numbers for write and read speed. Sorry about that. Either way the system boots up in seconds and apps open very quickly.Build quality and comfort: This thing has acceptable build quality. The screen has flex (expected) and the entire thing is made out of a plastic brushed-aluminum mock-up. It's trying to look like aluminum but it's just not. Because of this it is a fingerprint magnet especially on the typing/wrist rest area. Side note: this thing is not very comfortable to type on. The area where my arm rests to type is met by a sharp edge of the laptop and it happens to leave an imprint on my wrist. Not comfortable for extended periods of time. The area I'm talking about is right where the lid closes. I think they made it the sharp edge to meet with the lid better but my wrists certainly don't appreciate it.Weight: This thing is light (just over five pounds). So light that you can't lift the lid with one hand; instead the entire thing comes with you. I wish this wasn't the case as I'm used to only using one hand but I'll excuse it because of its lack of weight (my other laptop is well over 10 pounds). The performance to weight ratio on this machine is definitely above average especially at this price point. Good job on that Acer. I won't mind hauling this around to class all day.I/O: Probably important to you if you're looking for specific ports. This machine is loaded with I/O: both old and new. It has a 3.1 type C port (not Thunderbolt compatible unfortunately) two USB 3.0 ports one USB 2.0 port a multi-jack (headphones line in etc) a HDMI port and a VGA port. It also includes a Kensington lock and of course the AC power port. Oh yeah you even get a DVD drive in this thing. You won't usually see those elsewhere.Graphics/Display: This has a dedicated video card which I wasn't expecting. Granted it's not the best but it's better than the integrated graphics. It may not be by a huge margin but at least it's there. Probably around a 2x increase over the Intel HD Graphics you usually see in laptops like this. The display is 1920x1080 on a 15.6"" screen. This is my first laptop this small and to be honest it took some getting used to. For most people 15.6"" seems to be the sweet spot and I can see why. It's not bulky enough to be a nuisance to lug around but it's not small enough to where videos aren't enjoyable to watch. The panel is not IPS however so you're going to have some off viewing angles. But then again I'm usually indifferent about panel type because I always look at the screen head-on.Update 8/12: I notice this display has some type of ""adaptive brighness."" While I can't find any documentation on it (granted I haven't looked for it in the manual) if you're looking at a rather dark image (dark grays dark forests night photos overall dark videos etc.) the display will dim regardless of the brightness setting. If you switch back to a white image it'll slowly fade to the higher brightness. It also appears to flicker during this process. I can't find a setting to disable this option but perhaps I've not looked hard enough. I'll report back later if I find one.Update 8/13: I checked the Windows settings and adaptive display is turned off in the power options menu. This must mean it's baked into the hardware unless there's a setting somewhere in some Acer program.Update 1/1/17: I figured out that the brightness adjustment is via Intel and some of you pointed this out to me via the comment sections. To disable it you need to open the Intel HD Graphics software navigate to Power and disable the power saving technology.Also I tweaked some of the color settings in the Intel control panel because the colors seem oversaturated. I'll blame the display technology and I have no idea what Acer ExaColor is. I hate proprietary technology that isn't explained.Keyboard: Dedicated area for this. Pretty much your run-of-the-mill laptop keyboard. Key travel is not what I want it to be and it seems especially mushy to type on. This is coming from somebody who has a heavy bias towards mechanical keyboards. Somehow I was able to type this whole review on this laptop's keyboard however. Also bare in mind that this is my first membrane typing experience in a few months so if you're used to laptop keyboards you probably won't be disappointed. Probably the best thing about the keyboard is that it's backlit. This is also one of the reasons I purchased this laptop. I tend to sit in the dark a lot and even though I am a touch typist it's still nice to see the keys.Update 8/12: I neglected to mention another petpeeve of mine about laptop keyboards. This keyboard has the half-sized arrow keys. I tend to use the arrow keys a lot and while the left and right arrows are full sized the up and down ones are only half sized. They could have prevented this by shrinking the right shift key along with the numpad 0 key but I'll have to deal with it. If you're like me and you like full arrow keys then this may bother you as well.Trackpad: Not glass. I find it to be rather grippy so my finger tends to lag across its surface. I'll definitely be using a mouse whenever I can with this laptop. At least it uses native windows drivers so you don't need any additional software for gesture support.Sound: Decent speaker system. Unfortunately they're bottom mounted. That means sound quality will depend heavily on whatever surface your laptop is on. YouTube videos sounded acceptable but music sounded a bit underwater-like. They're still decent nonetheless. I opt to use headphones most of the time anyway but your ears should hold up if you decide to rely on them.Update 8/13: I found out that disabling Acer TrueHarmony in the sound settings improves the sound and makes it less underwater-like. I'm not a huge fan of software-based sound modifiers so I'll be sure to keep this setting off. In some cases however it helps but in my daily usage of this laptop I find it's better to have it turned off.Upgrades: As I alluded to above (mostly in the RAM section) this laptop can be ugraded. Not extensively but it's there. There's an open RAM slot so you can pop in another 8 GB 2133 MHz stick and have a total of 16 GB. Will you need that much for this laptop? Also there's an empty SATA port. You can insert a 2.5"" HDD or SATA SSD but be warned that it's kind of roomy in there. Your drive will pop out and slide around (effectively disconnecting it) if you move the laptop around a lot (i.e. toss it on a bed throw it around in your backpack etc.) I don't know if you'll be able to get a HDD slot to make it snug in there but mine already has come loose after barely turning over my laptop. Maybe I should tape it down. Also if you flip your laptop over and then back again you'll hear the drive hit the upgrade bay door. It seems to still be connected to the system when it does this but I'm really going to need tape or a drive bay. I'll just need to find one that fits because the last thing I want happening is for the HDD to randomly disconnect while I'm transferring data to or from it.Battery: I haven't been able to fully test this claim of ""up to 12 hours."" I'll agree that on full brightness you'll probably see up to 7 or 8 hours. Either way that's a full class day for me. I'll come back to this portion in the future.Update 1/1/17: I think the 12 hour claim will only hold up if you keep your processor speed capped your brightness all the way down and have every power saving feature enabled. I've had this laptop for several months now and while it can last me a class day I usually don't trust it. I usually woke up around 8:30 a.m. and powered on my laptop at 9:15 a.m. By the time of my third class at 2:15 p.m. battery is around 20% or less. I usually charge it before that class and keep in mind the thing is powered on but idle. Not sleeping usually just lid closed and not doing anything. So that's around a real-world battery life of 5-6 hours which really isn't bad. But not close to the claim of ""up to 12 hours"" at least for me.Noise: This is a very quiet laptop. The fan can barely be heard. After all the specs aren't very power hungry so they don't generate a lot of heat. I haven't put this under a full load yet so I haven't been able to hear the loudest fan speed yet. I'll probably come back to this section as well.Update 8/13: While running Cinebench the fan did kick up to what I believe was full speed and it was still relatively quiet. It was noticable in a quiet environment but if you're in class or in a meeting I doubt you'll be doing anything that would cause the fan to spin up to maximum RPM. But if you do it shouldn't be noticable at all.I'm enjoying this laptop for the price of $550. I don't really think you can beat this right now. I mean come on: a SSD 2133 MHz RAM a decent CPU and even a dedicated GPU and a backlit keyboard? If ANYBODY asks me for laptop recommendations this one is going to be at the top of the list regardless of budget. I have to really praise Acer for this one. This is my first laptop review so be sure to leave a comment if you want to see anything covered that I perhaps missed.Even with its flaws this laptop is getting a five-star rating from me. Only the i5 version though. As I stated above the i7 version is really not worth it. There is definitely a general consensus out there that ""i7s are always better because they're top tier"" but that's not always the case and this system makes a point of that. However if you have the extra $150 lying around you will likely increase the resale value of this laptop because an i7 will make people think it's the ""premium"" version. Knowing this I still got the i5. If the i7 version was a 25 - 30% increase in performance then sure the extra $150 would be it. Not at 10% though; it just seems like a ripoff.Updated 8/11: Because I typed this on the laptop keyboard I made some typing errors. I've fixed them and I made some other minor tweaks here and there.Updated 8/12: If any of you are familiar with Cinebench here are the scores for this particular i5 model:269 cb53.31 fps OpenGLUpdated 8/13: I feel like I'll be updating this daily as I find out more information about it.",0

August 12  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,1 Month Review: This laptop is the perfect $600 (after taxes) laptop! It's specs are unheard of at this price range - 2.3Ghz + 2.8Ghz Turbo Boost Intel Core i5 Dual Core 6200u 8gb DDR4 RAM 256gb SSD NVIDIA GeForce 940MX w/ 2gb Dedicated GDDR5 RAM packaged with Windows 10!? If you have the money and want a gaming laptop buy this! It can run games like WarFrame Rocket League The Sims 4 and more at Ultra settings and other popular titles such as GTA V Black Ops III at decent FPS and graphics. It's 1080p Display is also a nice touch at this price point. The webcam is very average at 720p but that's definitely no problem. Battery life is great when you aren't playing a game but when you are you should carry the charger with you so it doesn't turn off mid-game. The touchpad feels a little iffy but it's easy to get used to and mouses are cheap. The keyboard feels nice and is backlit no complaints there. You can easily add a hard drive if the 256gb SSD is too little for you. It doesn't feel super premium but as long as you don't drop it all the time it'll last for sure.Quick Review:PROS:- AMAZING specs for the price.- Great display and keyboard- Can run AAA titles at decent settings and most other games at Ultra settings.- Not too heavy easy to transport.- Boots up very quickly and opens programs very quickly thanks to its SSD.- Comes with Windows 10.CONS: (none of these are too relevant buy this laptop!)- Soft webcam- Touchpad isn't great,0
Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        15 of 15 people found the following review helpful       I chose this laptop and am very happy with the purchase for my business and personal use  September 30  2016By utterlover,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,After a quite a bit of researching I chose this laptop and am very happy with the purchase for my business and personal use.I purchased it on Friday and received it on Monday evening (I live in Hawaii) and I've put this laptop to a whole lot of scrutiny. I've come up with numerous pros than only a handful of cons.Now a summary of the specs and features for the laptop -Build – Unlike mac book pros and Dell XPSs the Acer does not have an aluminium case and lid. It is made of a black plastic but at the same time it does not feel like a cheaply build. The material is smooth and sleek where you rest your wrists and hands for typing. The lid is a sturdier piece with firm hinges. This laptop doesn’t heat!! Big factor. This laptop was geniusly designed with many vents on the bottom and sides. You will feel heat being pushed out through the left side of the laptop via the fan. Neither the keyboard nor the bottom of the laptop is hot to touch after hours of working. The fan is quite too. The laptop is on the lighter side for me. Its no ultrabook but I like it.RAM - 1x8GB DDR4 is fit in this model with an empty slot for future upgrades for a maximum of 16 GB. For work purposes I use Bluebeam Adobe and the occasional AutoCAD and Revit. 8 GB is enough. As most computer nerds know its not just about the size of the ram but the processor speed. More on that later.Storage - 256GB SSD is a huge selling point. The boot up and shut down speeds are incredibly fast. I use dropbox and usb to store my work so a 1 TB hard drive is not necessary for me. o worth it. The SSD is a M.2 SSD (Samsung MZNLN256HCHP) and the other hard disk slot is empty. You can add an additional hard drive but I will not.Processor - 6200U is a dual core 4 thread CPU. Yes it is not the quad core Hqs but for the price i’m fine with it. This allows my to have multiple apps without noticing any lag. I have played DOOM 3 BFG on this with no problems.GPU – The dedicated graphics card is GTX 940MX which is an improvement of integrated graphics cards.Screen – The screen is my only negative. The laptop is 15.6 inches and is a decent size. My previous 4 year old Dell XPS 13’s screen is brighter and more vibrant in colors than this screen.Keyboard and touchpad – The chiclet keyboard is decent and the number pad is always a plus. Typing is quite comfortable. Many people complain if there is no backlit keyboard. This laptop has one. I am not a big fan of the track pad. I find it to be a little laggy.Battery – A big reason why I purchased this laptop is due to the 6 cell battery. Battery life of actualy casual use ie using word or web surfing is around 8 hours. If I am watching a movie or playing video games then the battery life drops down to around 3.5 hours. This is excellent for me. I charge the laptop once a day during work if starting out with a full battery charge.Sound – Sound is decent. Nothing amazing nothing horrible.Ports - has 3 usb ports total. USB 3.0 USB 2.0 and USB Type C for future protection. HDMI VGA Ethernet SD card reader and DVD drive which is a must for my work. Drawings and specs from the government come in cd format.,0
Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       so I like to have a machine that can at least play ...  November 17  2016By Joshua Fuchs,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've used a number of laptops over the years so my experience this time is in relation to all those experiences.  I could never justify spending more than $600 I'm sure laptops above that range have been performing this well for a while but I have a desktop that I need for heavy lifting so my computer budget mainly goes there.  This was my back-to-third school present to bring me into the next age.  My use is generally moderate- I've been a mixture of scientist/student and gamer for years and I have a few different schools under my belt so I like to have a machine that can at least play something interesting between PCR runs as well as a machine that can compile my results.  I have also been dabbling in a bit of coding recently so I wanted something that could fit a broad spectrum of needs but without getting a garbage quality deal.  This is probably my favorite platform so far that I've ever used for it's mix of good processor great amount of memory a solid state drive battery life and a dedicated graphics option (from nvidia).  If you're not interested in a little gaming the integrated options from both camps should be plenty to meet your needs while saving a little money but I have to say get the SSD it's just a much better laptop experience and so much better for battery life.My battery life is actually what got me to start this review; I'm closing in on another finals week so I've been chomping through lecture and lab at a steady pace- this streamed from 10pm until 1am and I'm writing this in morning with what says 50%/3 hours of life left.  Having done this cycle for a few weeks now it's legitimate and I expect to get that.  On lower usage- maybe writing just word docs no internet I have no doubts this could hit ten hours easily.  If I'm playing a game Skyrim perhaps I'll make it a solid three full hours before needing to find my power strip.  Because of the few moving parts it's very quiet while in use and the speakers have enough punch that I can plug in my controller and kick back on the couch.The long battery life and good sized SSD would make this great fit for a student who spends hours away from their residence.  When I was an undergrad the options were to either bring a bunch of spare bulky batteries/ bring your power cord and hope for a spot next to an outlet (though I imagine this variable has been rectified since then)/ or buy a netbook that gets good battery life but makes you wait while it chugs on its low-power processor; I did all three and would have been happy to have this ten years ago.As far as gaming goes you should be considering a stable desktop option if you're wanting the most bang for your buck but if you're set on a laptop it doesn't get much better than this at this price point.  I was actually surprised by how well both Skyrim and Fallout 4 performed on this.  Skyrim plays well with a mix of mostly high settings at 1080p and FO4 at least runs above 30fps albeit at basically straight low settings.  Still good to get my fix.  Civilization 5 was just dreamy and Civ 6 actually plays quite well on here; I haven't tried pushing massive maps but at least on standard maps and below it's great.  Really if you want to play it this will run it at frames that are not subpar; I've included the few I've had time to tinker with to give you an idea.The only two minor odd things I've encountered are the webpages bugging out with what looks like barcodes but over all the text on the page and the track pad has a multigesture that sometimes takes too much gesture from a simple touch.  The first issue could be firefox though I'm running the same version on two other computers of mine and I've never encountered that before.  The second could be a setting I could adjust but it doesn't detract anything from my experience as I usually use a wireless mouse; it also could be that I'm not use to multigesture track pads because I always use a mouse so take that gripe with a grain of salt.Overall I'd buy this again and this is now my top recommendation to friends who need a little crossover laptop on a modest budget.,0
Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Great laptop for the price!  October 24  2016By sarahbeth924,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm a freelance editor working from home and I've been using this laptop for about a week. I bought it to replace my desktop while we pack up the house to move and so far I have no regrets. This solid state drive makes the system run as smoothly and quickly as my desktop and I have experienced no slow-down while working across several Word documents with multiple browser tabs open as well as Slack messaging and other miscellaneous programs - nothing graphics intensive but enough to slow down other budget-friendly laptops I have owned.I've seen comments about the keyboard elsewhere stating that it isn't of high quality that the keys are too shallow or that is isn't of high quality. I sit and type all day for a living and I can say that this is one of the most comfortable fastest laptop keyboards I have ever used. Maybe that says more about the quality of laptops I have owned in the past than about the quality of this particular laptop but I think this one is pretty great. The backlight is a nice feature but I have it turned off most of the time. The keys don't cover the light entirely so for me the lights under the top row of keys are visible. As I don't like have a row of exposed LEDs at the bottom of my line of sight I just keep the feature turned off unless I need it.The battery life has also been excellent and more or less as advertised. The 12+ hour mark is maybe a little optimistic unless you are doing nothing but light web browsing.NOTE: There are several versions of this laptop available all called the Acer Aspire E 15. Best Buy sells one in store and online that looks a lot like this version but is around $200 cheaper. Don't be fooled! The cheaper versions have lesser build quality (all plastic casing instead of mostly plastic with metal around the keyboard no keyboard backlight) and less impressive specs (half the memory larger HD but old-school SATA which is a huge battery and performance drain). Spend the extra money on this version and you will not be disappointed!,0
Laptops,B01F1Z78GM,Acer Aspire E 15 E5-575G-76YK…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Linux Mint 18 - BIOS/UEFI v1.70 fun  July 17  2016By CB in South Florida,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Having ""fun"" getting Linux Mint 18 installed with BIOS v1.70?* Are you getting errors during the installation that a ""vfat SCSI(000)"" partition cannot be mounted (and then the installation hangs)?* Did the installation seem to go cleanly -- but when you reboot you get a ""No bootable device"" error and you can't figure out how to fix this in the BIOS?* Is your Linux Mint installation hanging when you choose to install third-party drivers and choose the option to allow Linux Mint to disable Secure Boot for you?Yeah I had some ""fun"" getting Linux Mint 18 installed with BIOS v1.70 (which is version 1.04 of the ""InsydeH20 Setup Utility"" apparently).  I love Linux Mint and I bought this laptop for use as a Linux-only laptop (i.e. obliterate the Windows 10 that comes with the laptop and install Linux Mint 18 from scratch).The notes below may help you if you get stymied during the install process.  Note: the suggestions below are ONLY if you intend to WIPE your hard drive and use Linux Mint 18 solely.  This is NOT for ""dual boot"" installations.  Do NOT follow this advice if you want to keep your Windows 10 installation.Before you install Linux Mint I recommend that you first update your BIOS.  And since Acer's BIOS updater only works with Windows you must first boot your laptop to Windows visit the Acer website download the BIOS update and apply it.  All before installing Linux Mint.Then before you install Linux Mint boot to your BIOS (press the F2 key right after booting the laptop):1. in the ""Security"" tab you must first set a ""supervisor password"" (WRITE THIS DOWN SOMEWHERE so you don't forget it);2. then in the ""Boot"" tab set Secure Boot to DISABLED.3. then set the boot order so that your USB thumbdrive (or DVD drive if you are using a DVD) is listed before your hard drives4. Press the F10 key to save your changes & exitNo problem right?  Now you can install Linux Mint 18 normally.AFTER the Linux Mint installation completes you have to reboot and go back into the BIOS:1. in the ""Boot"" tab temporarily ENABLE Secure Boot (so that other options become enabled)2. in the ""Security"" tab choose the ""Select an UEFI file as trusted for executing"" option and choose ""HDD1"" then ""EFI"" then ""ubuntu"" then ""grubx64.efi""3. then go back to the ""Boot"" tab and DISABLE Secure Boot once again.4. Press the F10 key to save your changes & exitThere are probably better ways to do this.  But it seems like the BIOS should have been able to handle this more .. uhh ... intuitively.  But maybe I'm just missing something blindingly obvious.  ;-)Note: during the installation process I received unrecoverable file system errors.""The attempt to mount a file system with type vfat in SCSI (000) ...blah blah blah.... failed. You may resume partitioning from the partitioning menu.""This error locked up the install process forcing me to reboot each time.  I got around these errors by quitting the Linux Mint installer rebooting into the Linux Mint live USB and then using the GParted application to remove any/all partitions on /dev/sda.  (You'll find the GParted application in the Menu of the Live USB distribution.)  Once the entire /dev/sda device was unallocated I started the Linux Mint installer again and let the installer create my partitions automatically.  Worked like a charm.  Truth be told I might have caused these errors by choosing the ""Do Something Else"" option in the partition dialog in the installer (instead of letting the Linux Mint installer do that automatically).  If so my bad.The above ""fun"" notwithstanding Linux Mint 18 is GREAT on this laptop.  The performance for office/productivity apps is snappy.  No severe driver issues (see below).  I have dual monitors set up -- one on the HDMI port the other on the VGA port.  No screen tearing or other problems.  And with an SSD loading applications is nearly instant.  This isn't a gaming laptop so I haven't tried any brutal graphics on it.The only driver issue so far came about when I poked my nose into the ""Driver Manager"" and selected the nvidia-361 driver.  The nvidia-361 driver worked perfectly -- up until I connected an external monitor to the HDMI port.  Then the machine locked up until I disconnected the external monitor.  So for now I'm sticking with the xserver-xorg-video-nouveau driver which allows me to use the monitors on my HDMI and VGA ports.  Note: the Linux Mint installer will automatically choose the xserver-xorg-video-nouveau driver so you won't run into this problem unless you poke your nose in the Driver Manager tab and start making changes (like I did).Oh and the WiFi adapter works for me (though admittedly I only use a wired connection with the laptop).If this helped anyone then great.Live Love Linux  ;-)",0

October 19  2016By matt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,best laptop on the market for the price. just wish it had an amoled screen instead of a lcd but for the price i cant complain. viewing left to right doesnt distort the image one bit it just has a small up and down veiwing angle than id like.i can even run halo 5 forge on max graphics and only uses 70 % of the cpu and 7.5 GB of ram (i installed another stick FYI)the battery holds a charge for a long time. im very impressed with the battery life for being such a small battery.at a idle it says about 12 hours (i like how the GHZ drops to .7 while just doing simple stuff then jumps up to 2.8 when needed) this saves alot of power. i like the back lit keyboard and the SSD is super fast and boots fast. as well the HDD slot is open so i dropped a 500GB on top of the already 256 Gb SSD. the speakers are okay and better than i expected.people complain about the cheap plastic on the out side. i dont mind the bottom is this fabric textured gunmetal gray that actually looks cool with a smooth lid. for the price its great.no bloat-ware which is a added bonus.no problems with the wifi and it always connects and very quickly.while browsing it says about 8 to ten or while using a word program.minecraft/ halo spartan assault about 4 hourshalo 5 an hour at best,1
Laptops,B01APA6K6M,Samsung Chromebook 3 XE500C13-K01US 2…,        245 of 269 people found the following review helpful       Great budget machine for those that use their laptops mainly online (research  shopping  email  YouTube  etc).  August 22  2016By Phillippia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought a  Dell Inspiron laptop a few years ago (it is an i5 machine with 1TB...used primarily for processing pictures and videos) that ran on Windows 7. At the time Windows 8 was the current OS but I had heard a lot of bad things...hence I stuck with Windows 7. Fast forward a couple of years and here is a relentless popup encouraging me to upgrade to Windows 10 for a free incredible feature-rich upgrade. After closing the popup for several months I finally did it....I upgraded. WRONG MOVE!!Currently my laptop no longer functions smoothly or correctly. The trackpad goes buggy I can no longer use the Start menu without an error it hangs up mysteriously etc. I spent weeks installing updates doing workarounds etc trying to get it to work.  When I was finally so disgusted that I just wanted to revert to Windows 7 it was too late. I could not restore my system back to it's previous state. My beloved laptop was ruined!I felt I should sue Bill Gates and Microsoft for the cost of my laptop...they presented their OS as a stable system meanwhile they were using me as a beta tester. Since I have neither the time or money to litigate I decided to take my dollars elsewhere. I first considered an Apple machine but realized just how pricey they are. After many of our local school systems left behind the iPads for Chromebooks I started to research them.Chromebooks are basically laptops that only capable of running Chrome (they call it Chrome OS but it is basically a glorified Chrome browser). My previous laptop was mainly used to process digital photos using Lightroom or Adobe's Creative Cloud. Chromebooks are not powerful enough to run real programs like Lightroom Photoshop etc. They are not set up to install the software needed and even if they were they do not meet the minimum specs for resource heavy programs like Photoshop or the latest PC game. If you need a laptop to run Windows or Mac OS programs a Chromebook is NOT for you.If you can do your tasks in the Chrome web browser you should be able to do it on a Chromebook:  watch YouTube videos shop on Amazon check email type a document in Word (online version) pay bills online etc. As a college student I can use my Chromebook to complete 99% of all assignments required. The one snag that I had was when I needed to install a screen recorder for a Jing presentation in a technology class. Of course I could not install the software onto my Chromebook (I ended up installing it on my buggy Windows 10 machine and suffering through the assignment). Outside of that I have been able to do everything I've needed to with my Chromebook.Since this is a browser-based machine I should also mention that there is no way to directly install another web browser. I would like to have Firefox installed also since some web sites work better with it than with Chrome...but if you try to install the browser from the web you will get an error message. I have read that there is a way to Frankenstein a copy of Firefox onto the Chromebook but it is not that important to me.As far as the quality of this Chromebook...it is very lightweight and very flimsy. In it's defense all of the Chromebooks that I looked at in this price range are thin lightweight and a bit flimsy. I really like the look of this Chromebook and the dimpled surface helps to give you grip when you are handling it. I try not to put the full weight of my wrists on this keyboard when I am typing and I surely try to not flex the lid/display as I open and close it (many reviews on the net say that the screen is easily broken and only adhered internally with a bit of tape...don't know if it is true since opening it up will void my warranty).The plus side is that this is a speedy little laptop. As soon as you open the lid it is booted up and ready to work within a few seconds. Once booted you must sign in with your Google credentials for full access to your machine and it's features. I was able to surf without lag with 10-12 tabs open at once. If some of those tabs were streaming video I could not open up as many before I saw the lag (but who does that...for me it was only for testing purposes). I watch HD video on my Chromebook without any problem (YouTube Hulu Netflix Tablo etc). I used this Chromebook for the last several months during the summer semester of class. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to others that need a cheap efficient work horse. I would just caution others to be careful to treat it with kid gloves as a large fall or hit would probably destroy it on the first occurence. I recommend a padded case and a protective skin.CONS:Cheap plastic flimsy feelCannot run software that require a true OSDoesn't feel durableNeed Google Cloud Print enabled printer to print out of the box.PROS:Cheap priceNowhere near the risk for viruses/trojans as Windows systemsCan do most common tasks such as paying bills online shopping watching online videos etc.Quick and easy updates via Chrome OSYou can make any moderately modern printer able to print from the Chromebook using Google Cloud and a little work.Very nice looking display for the price point.,1

Very glad that I did. Set up took 5 minutes. All I had to do is was log onto my Google account and it replicated exactly the configuration I have on the LG Chromebase. How great is that! Did not have to spend hours tweaking the setup like you have to on a traditional computer. Very happy with the Samsung Chromebook.

October 24  2016By Jerry Palmerino Jr,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Update 11/17/16: As of 11/17/16 this model supports installing most Android apps. You have to enable the Developer Channel in the Chromebook Settings and reboot. Then you will have the Play Store in the taskbar.Original Review:It has been a while since I last used a Chromebook.  Chromebooks have some advantages.  Fast boot times is one of them.  Freedom from worrying about viruses is another.When I saw the Google Play Store was coming to Chromebooks I decided to pick one up again.  This particular model is on the list of Chromebooks that will be eventually getting the Play Store.I chose this one because it had 4 Gb of RAM.  Surely double the RAM over other Chromebooks will always be useful especially when running Android apps.The screen is crisp enough from typing distance.  Its generally on par with all other Chromebooks.Typing on a Chromebook has proven to be something I need to get used to.  The keys are big enough and spaced well enough but there's a cramped feeling when typing and soreness too.  I find myself making a lot more typing errors.  This doesn't feel like a full-size keyboard.The trackpad supports two finger scrolling and right clicking by using a two finger click.The build quality is great.  There's no flex in the keyboard and no flex in the chassis either.  It is solid.  I wish Samsung would have opted to use micro-usb charging instead of the proprietary barrel style charger.  The charging cable is short but since Chromebooks deliver hours and hours of battery life you won't be tied to a wall outlet all the time.Overall I like this Chromebook.  There are  lot of similarly priced Chromebooks out there.  After some research I chose this one.,0

Fortunately a friend was visiting the States and I was able to order my new 4gb Samsung Chromebook 3 which he was able to bring back with him. We've had it several days now and are delighted: delivery was amazingly quick we received everything as it should be and our new laptop hit the ground running. It's just like we've gotten our beloved old Chromebook back only better: a better deal and a better Chromebook. Christmas came early for us this year after a visit from the Grinch.The screen on our new Chromebook is sharper and has better color for my money. The build feels good and stout and everything's ""tight."" It has the feel of a quality product. I was quite fond of the silver color on the old Samsung but this black is growing on us. Word processing is what I do and the keyboard works for me as does the track pad. I function just fine thank you without a mouse. And while this new unit sees even slimmer and perhaps more petite overall the keyboard is a pleasure to use. We're glad we went with the 4gb model and find the performance snappy compared to the old unit.I continue to hear people ask ""What can you do with a Chromebook?"" My thought is more ""What can't you do with a Chromebook?"" The only time I truly need to reach for a pc laptop is to edit photos and that's only because of the software I use. And I think better online photo editing tools are coming if they haven't arrived already. Yes I have limited on-board storage and pretty much have to have a wifi connection for full functionality but it works for us: word processing internet searches e-mail streaming to our television watching Thai and Vietnamese cooking videos on youtube maintaining our contacts and calendarsupdating  to-do lists (Google Keep) trying to learn Spanish (Duolingo) ordering online and doing online banking. There's much more of course but the point is that we don't feel deprived because ""it's only a Chromebook."" What we do feel is delighted that we got it for around $200 and there will no doubt be better deals before all is said and done.I was quite happy with my old Samsung Chromebook and am completely pleased with the new Samsung Chromebook 3. They're a breeze to set up fire up in a flash and efficiently go about their business--and they're affordable. Better yet I never have to buy software and don't worry about security since that's constantly updated. And it's so light and petite I never leave home without it. All I want to do now is to find a decent and affordable travel speaker--then I can load up a micro sd card with music and hit the road. Even if there's no wi-fi I'll still have tunes and know that wherever I am when I do get wi-fi I'll have a solid little bundle of efficient and affordable technology to take care of 99% of what needs doing.",0

January 13  2017By JK,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is my second Samsung Chromebook.  I (stupidly) opted for the 2 GB version.  Let me be clear if you use a lot of extensions like I do or you have a lot of tabs open like I do I don't think the 2 GB version is for you.  Even with all my extensions disabled there is still noticeable ""stuttering"" or lag when opening new tabs or navigating links.The battery life is beyond exceptional though much better than my last Chromebook but this may come at the expense of performance and hence the lagging that I experience.  Still all in all if you can spring for the 4 GB model you may have a better experience.  If battery life is top priority I don't see how you can go wrong with this model.  Good luck :)",0

Having a very...helpful four year old I didn't want to get anything terribly expensive as she murdered my new tablet as well.  After looking into the whole Chrome vs Windows thing I decided that everything I do is via a Google app/site/thing so why not.  I don't need to store a lot of stuff since cloud.This came in a nice little box within a box. All parts were in excellent order with the cute little plastic clings to show how new it wasSet up was in less than five minutes and the little intro was helpful.  This thing is C-U-T-E!  I'm not used to the touch pad nor the whole laptop thing but I'm finding it works well.  Fat fingers aren't an issue.Now I'm no techie nor do I know anything about computers so I am pretty useless with that part of the review; keep in mind my PC was running XP.  For someone who needs a cute little computer for light use this is perfect.  It isn't terribly heavy which is a bonus.The tutorials on how to convert Word programs to Google apps is quite helpful as well.,0

December 11  2016By Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Slow out of the box. I enjoy how it's thin but the build is all plastic and extremely cheap. Boot speeds are really slow more than a few minutes. Windows don't respond 9/10 times. This computer is pretty bad might be good for surfing the web but is not recommended for emails or students. A solid state drive might help but you're better off buying a better laptop for 100 bucks more. I restarted bit and it's been 10 minutes and still no boot. Mind you this is a gift not for myself they might end up hating this.,0
Laptops,B01LXCBXQO,"ASUS ZX53VW 15.6"" Gaming Laptop…",        72 of 77 people found the following review helpful       Wow. Buy this if you want more gaming power than an XBoxOne or PS4  in a portable laptop.  November 27  2016By ProfessorF,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,BACKGROUND: I'm a gamer (and a professor too :-). I wanted a laptop that could play my favorite game (Dark Souls 3) at max settings 1080p/30fps and also run R for statistical analyses.  Dark Souls 3 is a graphics-intensive game and my previous laptop could not even muster 10fps with its AMD A10 APU.QUICK FEATURE SUMMARY: The ASUS ZX53VW has an Intel i5-6300HQ quad-core processor and NVidia GTX 960M w/4GB dedicated RAM 8GB of RAM and a 512Mb SSD DVD (yes!) 2 USB 3.0 ports 1 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C port (smartphone) and SD card readerCUT TO THE CHASE: If you want the power of an Xbox One or PS4 next-gen console in a laptop this is the most inexpensive solution—it is the cheapest laptop that outperforms gaming consoles. This computer is blazingly fast. It played Dark Souls 3 (again a graphics intensive game) at max settings 1080p/30-35fps and at low settings 1080p/50-60fps.  That's BETTER performance than that you get on an Xbox One or PS4.Negatives? I don't see a pop-out for the battery so you might have to pop screws to replace.Yes buy this. Especially if you can get it for <$700 like I did during Black Friday!,1

This computer does that easily. As an added bonus it also runs all the video games I own without freezing getting hot or running the fan so loud it dominates the noise in the room (not to say the fan doesn't run or it can't be heard but it's quiet enough to not be an issue for me).Pros:Nice sized solid state driveOne of the best graphics cards at this price pointBattery can make it through several hours of work related activities (haven't tested long sessions of video games on the battery).Keyboard has a nice feel. My last laptop had very little drop for each key. This ASUS is lovely to type on.Does not get hot at least while I'm working and for the non-intensive games I play (think Mount and Blade: Warband)Cons:Track pad is sometimes frustrating missing clicks or minor jerks. I use a USB mouse instead.Volume control on the keyboard requires 2 hands (fn key + F10-F12),0

February 20  2017By Gregory Curtis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Great computer if your looking for a gaming laptop that wont break your bank yet has all the items you need. I was way overdue a new computer. My previous gaming laptop was about 7 years old...was a older ASUS g73jh. I got every pennies worth of my purchase out of it with minimal problems. So when I started looking for a new computer the last 6 months...ASUS was given bonus points.I basically had a couple criteria on what I wanted. Had to have a SSD preferably 512gb. Had to have video card with at least 3gb. Wanted a solid constructed device. Didn't want one that had reviews of people saying it felt cheap or flimsy etc. If possible also under $850.I had narrowed it down to a few systems but in the end this one was the winner. I met all those criteria above. As a bonus...it had like zero bloatware. It has DDR4 Ram so ignore the DDR3 of the information..that was for older version. I bought a second DDR4 Ram simm...the computer has two slots and the 8gb in it is one simm.Ive only had the computer a few days but its been flawless so far. I was able to run Elder Scrolls Online at practically max settings with no problem.,0

Haven't had any problems and all the reviews about its specs were pretty spot on. Some big pluses I personally have noticed are its battery life being 5 hours+ watching movies or doing homework (3-4 if playing a game maybe less if it's more hardware intensive) and stays relatively cool (warm but never hot like other laptops I have used).

Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am older and not very computer savvy. I had only used Windows and had a HP computer. I had someone recommend the MacBook saying how much they loved it. I was afraid that I would have a hard time trying to figure out how to use it since it is such a different configuration than Windows. Well I decided to take the plunge and boy I am so glad I did. It took a couple of days but it was not as hard as I thought it would be. I had to use Apple Care one time because I couldn't find files/photos that I had transferred from my old computer (told you I wasn't very savvy) anyway the lady I talked to was so kind and helped to walk me through what I needed to do to find them. I highly recommend you getting one if you are on the fence. It is so lightening fast and the touch pad is great. I had still used the mouse with the HP but it is so easy on this Mac that I don't use it anymore.Hope this helps someone.,0
Laptops,B00UGBMRQ8,Apple MacBook Pro MF839LL/A…,        45 of 48 people found the following review helpful       In a lot of respects  better than late 2016  November 10  2016By Ramundo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Bought this immediately after seeing the unveiling of the late 2016 model.  Losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker.  I use those for too often to have them be virtualized moving around or even unavailable.  The new one while touted to be up to x faster the numbers are based on the slowest 2015 and fastest 2016.  The base model went up in price $400 which excludes any performance benefits.  As a matter of fact video is actually slower than this model without the upgrade.  The only real upgrade for the new one before adding on options is faster memory.I run windows and linux VMs fairly regularly and while I could run them on a comparable Windows system adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me so while disappointed in the new upgrades this 2015 model still rocks VMs and does all I need it too for far less $$$.  While USB-C is cool a bag full of dongles is not.  I prefer ports especially the SD slot which I do use regularly.  With real function keys I don't worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys so this model is golden.  Hope Apple puts back the function keys and keeps the touch strip too.  I could see it being useful for some things but not a replacement for real function keys.Anyway if you are contemplating buying one of these and they are still available do it.  They are great machines even if the crowd loves to follow the blinky light!,0
Laptops,B00UGBMRQ8,Apple MacBook Pro MF839LL/A…,        13 of 13 people found the following review helpful       100% HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE!  December 2  2015By LoriA_Seattle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST MAC ... I have been a PC user all my life and had wanted to try converting to a Mac for years.  I've only had this Apple Macbook Pro for a week but let me tell you that on day one I fell in love with it.  Yes it does have a different feel from the PCs I have had (HP Toshiba Acer) but it was a good difference from the first time I put my fingers to the keyboard and began typing.  The screen display is absolutely amazing and totally blows me away.  I absolutely love the programs that come with it; how the Mac itself functions the appearance and quality of the Mac.  Everything about it is pure joy and I am 100% delighted with my purchase.  As far as the Mac vs. PC debate - by day two I was sold out to Macs.  While I had been use to a 17-inch screen display the 13.3-inch screen display of this Mac took zero time to get use to ... plenty big enough for work and play purposes (and did I mention the dynamic awesome graphic display???).The laptop is still new to me and I'm still discovering things about it daily so give me a little more time with it and I'll come back to update this review pros as well as any cons I discover.  At the present the only cons are:1.) having to use the arrow keys to move up and down pages as the slide on the right side bar (to hold the curser over and move up and down) doesn't stay up when I move the curser to it - but that may be something I am doing wrong as I'm still learning the intimacies of the Mac. (Case in point ... a day after writing this I discovered that moving two fingers together up or down on the touch pad will move the page up / down quite nicely.  lol.) 2.) battery life thus far isn't nearly as long as I thought it would be based upon video reviews of this model and item description.  Working on documents etc. battery life is great.  However playing the two games I enjoy on Facebook (Criminal Case and CSI) with some surfing the web in between will drain the fully-charged battery down to 20% in just 2 hours.  Playing the games some with more time spent surfing the web etc. drains the battery from fully charged to 43% in 3 hours.  Will battery life stretch with use?  I don't know.  Would battery life be extended if the games were on the laptop itself instead of online at a web site?  I'm not sure but think perhaps ...Let me add the vender DataVision Computer Video gives exceptional service.  After placing my order for the MacBook Air and discovering that I would be unable to upgrade the RAM I sent in a cancellation request that was handled by 'Mike S.'  Mike politely cancelled my order no problem and when I placed an order for this Macbook Pro the very next day he handled it personally and got it in the mail the same day even though I didn't request it or pay extra for speedy delivery.  When the Mac arrived it was VERY adequately and securely packaged; I was very pleased. NOTE: hubby and I don't have a a lot of extra money to indulge in extras after bills and living expenses so a purchase like this is something really big for us and we try and chose wisely.  Not only am I more delighted with the MacBook Pro than I hoped to be but hubby is so impressed with it that HE wants to convert from his PC to a Mac as soon as we can swing it.JANUARY 21 2016 UPDATE:  I love this laptop even more than before.  Feel totally comfortable with it and will never go back to a PC.JUNE 19 2016 UPDATE: the love story continues.  This MacBook is such a blessing and I would feel somewhat lost without it.  If you're considering getting this MacBook proceed with confidence.  It has been super easy to become familiar with it; the more I use it the more I appreciate it!PERSONAL MESSAGEI paid full price for Macbook Pro; I DID NOT get it at a discounted price in exchange for an evaluation.  So why did I take the time to write a detailed review?  Because I am like you … I depend upon the comments and experiences of other consumers when making an Amazon purchasing decision - especially an important one such as this.Even when I do provide a review in exchange for a free or discounted product I don’t feel obliged to write a positive one just an honest and fair one.  Also when reviewing products upon request I do not always rate a product 5 stars or even 4 stars.

It's a MacBook Pro and the last good model Apple made. It has actual USB 3.0 ports the MagSafe charger illuminated apple logo sd card reader HDMI port etc. The force trackpad is nice to use and eerily convincing with its click simulation. It feels just like the old style but you can click anywhere on the pad. I only hope by the time this computer dies Apple will have corrected their current gen mistakes.,0
Laptops,B00UGBMRQ8,Apple MacBook Pro MF839LL/A…,        9 of 9 people found the following review helpful       Outstanding product. The best laptop I've ever owned.  June 10  2016By Carlos,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"BLUF: Excellent laptop in every regard. Keyboard and Force trackpad are simply unmatched. OS X is delightful yet it is powerful enough to run Windows 10 and Linux virtual machines if you must.I am a highly experienced IT with in-depth knowledge of Windows and Linux. I still dislike Apple policies and processes and refused to pay more for the same (Apple maintains a strict 30%+ profit margin). The last and only Apple device I owned before this MBP was an original iPod because there were simply no better alternatives.That being said I love this MacBook Pro.Due to an upcoming long-term business trip I decided to get a new laptop computer in the 13-14"" form factor. I had been eyeing the Dell XPS 13 and the Razer Blade Stealth. Dell and Razer have excellent laptops in many ways superior to this dated MBP design but also suffer from quality control problems and lackluster keyboards and trackpads. After careful consideration and with full knowledge that a new MBP is expected in a couple of months I decided to buy this laptop.Again I love it.I just couldn't find a better alternative when it comes to quality. This thing feels solid throughout. Typing is a breeze. With every laptop I owned I had been forced to rely on an external mouse when trackpad after trackpad failed to deliver an intuitive and reliable experience. That is not the case here. The Force Trackpad is marvelous.After the easiest setup process ever I have migrated all my important data set up my wireless devices set up automatic backups and smart card compatibility. Let me tell you the praise for OS X is not overstated. It is so simple. The more I learn about it the more I realize it just works! The transition from Windows to OS X was no big deal.I have been using Windows 10 for over a year. Before that I pushed through 8 and 8.1 and really missed 7. 10 is the best Windows out there. Microsoft really stepped it up and delivered. However there are still bugs blue screens of sadness and all that jazz. There are still incompatible drivers broken applications and malware. You know the things I have yet to experience on my short time driving OS X hard.With the use of Parallels I created the Windows 10 and Linux (Kali) virtual machines I use for work. The integration between OS X and Windows Parallels is amazing. I have tons of experience with virtualization: VMWare Citrix Microsoft and Oracle flavors. They all have their strengths but for productivity between Windows and OS X nothing matches Parallels VMs in Coherence Mode. If you must use other OS as well this is the way to go.Keep in mind the MacBook Pro line is due for a significant refresh. Apple is expected to release more details shortly and there are rumors that the new devices will be up for sale between FY16 Q3 and FY17 Q1. Not only is a refreshed design and a slimmer form factor expected but also newer faster and more efficient processors upgraded memory replacement of F-Keys with an OLED display and almighty Thunderbolt 3. If you can wait you definitely should. If you can't you can take a chance with the other manufacturers or go for the solid and proven MBP line. I bet you won't be disappointed.",0

The reason for that is because I wanted to have a good chance to use the laptop for some time and experience its functions closely. After a couple of months of using this product I finally could say that it's the best thing that I have ever bought up to this moment. The laptop works great and the package was delivered on time. Regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged the inside box was fine.  I use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it's just great. Therefore my advice to you if you're a student and you need a laptop for school this laptop is the best choice for you. And if you're concerned about the system I would tell you that as a person who has never used a MacBook before actually buying it do not worry you will get used to it in no time as I did.,1

Laptops,B00UGBMRQ8,Apple MacBook Pro MF839LL/A…,        19 of 20 people found the following review helpful       As close to perfection as you can currently get  April 24  2015By travonius,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After a bit of internal debate between this and the Macbook Air I decided to get the Retina Macbook Pro.  What a great decision this was.  I come from using the original late 2008 aluminum Macbook.Dimensions/Weight:This Macbook Pro is much thinner and a couple centimeters shorter than my old Macbook.  With how slim this thing is I really don't see a need for the Macbook Air line.  It is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop except a Macbook Air.Display:The display is fantastic on this laptop.  Very sharp screen and good viewing angles.  Something about OS X running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a Windows computer could never match.Battery life:  I haven't had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge.  No complaints here.Keyboard and Trackpad:The keyboard is ok.  It is not my favorite in fact my late 2008 aluminum Macbook has a better keyboard.  Just the way the keys feel when they press in they are a bit softer on this model compared to my old one and I prefer a bit harder feel when typing.  It's all a personal preference.  Other than that the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine.The trackpad has gotten better with this new model.  The click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality.  The thing is fantastic.  The trackpad still does move a tiny bit but it isn't a big movement like the older type.  This is easily the best trackpad I have ever used.Speed:This computer is blazing fast.  Apps open instantly and the AC wifi performance is very nice.OS:With OS X Yosemite the OS is very refined and elegant.  You can even run time machine backups while the computer is sleeping now.  I'm not sure when this feature was introduced but it is very welcome.  The OS is easy to use the app store lacks many apps that I use so I have to go directly to the developers site to download them.  I have not messed with the continuity feature much but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iPhone.Overall:In my opinion having used a Surface Pro 3 older MacBooks and many other computers over the years this is the closest to perfect I have ever seen a computer get.  If I were to improve anything it would be to switch to the 2008 macbook style keyboard with the ""harder"" feel to the keypress and I would also add a third USB port.  The current model only has two which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive (which requires two ports) at the same time.  You need a USB hub to help you in that situation.",0
Laptops,B00UGBMRQ8,Apple MacBook Pro MF839LL/A…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Take it from a professional. Just get this Macbook Pro!  June 4  2016By Leontine Vandermeer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I recently purchased this MacBook Pro to replace a 2011 year model and oh wow what a difference! The screen is certainly the best reason to upgrade in case you are contemplating on doing this. With my old Macbook Pro I had to have the screen at a particular angle to see the picture properly or to see colors properly. Not so with this model. No matter how you have your screen angled you will see the picture accurately and it looks awesome.I am a web designer and programmer by profession and it's very important to me to have a really good screen. The 15 inch size is wonderful and large enough to do my job right. Any smaller and I would feel cramped probably. I do my main work on my 27"" iMac when it comes to doing graphic design work or development but just for doing maintenance and upgrades on websites using Wordpress for example I enjoy sitting on my couch with this laptop instead of at my desk.The trackpad is simply awesome as well. Yesterday I had to fix something on my neighbor's laptop a Dell and I got so frustrated because I'm so used to the Macbook's trackpad. On this PC laptop you couldn't click anywhere on the trackpad only on the very bottom. Nor could I scroll up and down easily with that thing. With the Macbook trackpad you can use multiple finger gestures for example just use two fingers simultaneously to scroll up or down. That is so much more intuitive than that PC's trackpad. For that reason alone I would switch from PC to a Mac. Not even mentioning working with Windows 10 versus OS El Capitan. Who are these Windows developers anyway that can't make anything straight forward?Now I was very pleased that my new laptop already came with 16GB RAM. Most laptops still come with only 8GB of RAM. I have 32GB on my iMac but I can't say it's any faster than my new MacBook Pro.I have no negative comments on my Macbook Pro. Maybe it would have been nice to have a touch screen as well but I'm okay without that because I own the iPad Pro 12.9"" as well. You may wonder why I also got the MacBook Pro if I already own the big iPad. The answer is: there are still many things that I do especially with my work that are done easier on a real computer but not necessarily by having to sit in my office.BTW if you are comparing or debating between a Windows touch screen laptop with a Macbook Pro without a touch screen. I will still recommend the Macbook Pro hands down!!! If quality and ease of use is important to you there is no other choice.I use the iMac for creating and developing. I use my Macbook for personal things and for simple updates and maintenance on websites. I use my iPad Pro for entertainment playing games browsing amazon traveling and much more. I love having exactly the right type of device when and where I need it.I know this Macbook Pro doesn't come cheap. But think of it as making a good investment. Macbook laptops last longer hold better resale value are of extremely good quality and will never let you down. Using the OS operating system is a breeze.A quick story to end my review. A month ago a friend of mine who owned a Lenovo laptop asked me to erase data from her laptop. I thought no big deal because how hard can it be? Well it took me all day just about. Of course not being used to Windows 10 didn't help but in order to perform certain actions I had to go all over the place on the computer to do them and often the screen would freeze on me (something that never happens on my iMac or Macbook). Nothing was straight forward. I kept having to ask Google how to do the simplest of tasks and the answers were always complicated. You'd think the control panel could handle all my requests but no the Windows control panel is nothing like Settings or Preferences on an Apple device. About the quality of that Lenovo laptop itself. The screen wasn't half bad I admit but the keyboard was AWFUL!!!!!! Each time I pressed on a key the entire keyboard moved down with it... it had a very plasticky and cheap feel.Get a Macbook Pro if you're in the market for a laptop. Even if you're coming from a Windows device. The transition isn't all that bad. If you own an older model of the Macbook Pro I highly recommend upgrading because the screen will blow you away and the speed of this laptop is unsurpassed.Tip: it's a really good idea to get a case for this beautiful laptop. I did and it's fantastic. It's the Thule Vectros 15"" MacBook Pro Retina Bumper (3203225) for $59 but it's well worth the price to protect your investment. It was very easy to put on and it looks really cool!So what are you waiting for? Take it from a professional. Just get this Macbook Pro!",0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        121 of 127 people found the following review helpful       Among the Best Tech Purchases I've Ever Made  September 25  2015By EconTeacher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've used computers with Microsoft operating systems since DOS 2.1 and have owned nearly 2 dozen Windows computers starting with version 3.1  and including 3 computers currently running Windows 10. While Microsoft has greatly improved their operating systems in terms of stability and ease of use operating systems in general (including the Mac OS in my opinion) have become bloated. With increasingly larger and more complex operating systems came programs that have also greatly increased in size and complexity. This requires larger amounts of RAM and HD space and places great demands on processors.The result is that many modern computers even ones with relatively fast quad core processors can be lethargic. For most of the ways that the average person uses their computer this should not be.  Most processors memory and hard drives are plenty fast enough but the huge operating systems get in the way. I learned today that Windows 10 has 40 million lines of computer code and Mac OS X has about 85 million lines. It's no wonder the average user experiences frustrations with these systems.This hit me one morning as I was trying to do something on one of my W10 notebooks. There were several programs open and  while what I was wanting to do was not particularly demanding the program was slow in loading and executing the task. You never know why programs become slow but it could have been a virus scan security update or just poor memory management from Windows which requires a reboot to correct.At that point I thought there had to be a capable but simpler alternative and I wondered if a Chromebook could be it. That set in motion a couple of weeks of reading user experiences and watching unboxing and review videos. After about a week of research I was ready to spend some money and give Chromebooks a try. Then the question became which one to buy?I looked closely at every major Chromebook on the market in the 13 - 15.6 inch size. Toshiba had a 13.3"" model that was widely praised but there were a surprising number of stories of quick screen failures and customers being told by Toshiba that some alleged misuse voided their warranties.This meant that some who had owned the Toshiba Chromebook for 3 months or less had unusable computers from a company that looked to be avoiding responsibility for faulty screens.  So no Toshiba.I then considered an HP 15 even though it was bigger and heavier than I wanted. The dealbreaker was when I realized that the HP's keyboard was actually a little smaller than the ones on 13.3 models due to large top facing speakers on either side of the keyboard  I was a little concerned about going to a 13.3"" computer after years of using notebooks with 15.6"" screens but I liked the idea of something light and travel-friendly. When I discovered that the HP had a little smaller keyboard than the 13"" models I scratched them off my list.Eventually I settled on the Asus. It had solid but unspectacular reviews and reports of excellent customer service. I spent a few extra bucks for the 4 GB model because the RAM on these systems is not upgradable and I did not want to have buyers remorse if I found out that the 2 GB model was straining to keep up with the way I use my computers.At home I have used this computer almost exclusively for 2 weeks. Only once did I start one of my Windows 10 machines and after seeing the Chromebook boot up almost instantaneously the Windows startup was painfully slow inefficient and frustrating. For every major way I use my computers--preparing lessons for my classes managing websites and working with social media--the Chromebook is superior.At school I have a Windows 7 desktop and notebook that I use extensively throughout the day. So many times I've thought about how much easier and more enjoyable the Chromebook operating system is to use.It's not a perfect platform. Simple photo editing is easy to do on the Chromebook but it does not have anywhere near the options available on the usual photo editing packages. In 2 weeks I had one occasion where I wanted to do a more complex edit and I thought about opening the Windows machine to accomplish it. I decided that the cost > benefit (this is what you get when an economics teacher writes reviews) so I didn't bother with it.For documents my school provides us with full access to Office 365 and the online versions of Word and Excel are more than sufficient for my needs. The menus are simpler and for most users that is a plus. (I really hate the Office Ribbon interface.)One day this week I was using more than a dozen tabs in Chrome plus I had probably 20 PDF documents open. I had been viewing a series of PDF documents and  I had not realized that I did not close each one after viewing them. It was the kind of mistake that would have caused a long painful freeze-up of any of my Windows computers but the Chromebook showed only the slightest hesitation in moving from screen to screen.  Once I closed some of the PDFs the system went back to Warp speed.My concern about moving from a 15.6 inch screen to the Asus 13.3 was unfounded. The Asus screen is bright and comfortable to read.In short I consider the Asus Chromebook to be among the best of my many many computer/technology buys of the last 30 years. In my very busy life I very rarely take time to write product reviews but I love this computer and I wanted to share this 30+ year computer users experience.If you are on the fence about jumping to Chromebook I'd recommend taking the leap.This Chromebook is free of the usual Windows frustrations and  delays.I'm so happy with this computer and the nimble OS that I'm thinking of buying another for school use.",0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        66 of 68 people found the following review helpful       Solid  functional  and easy on the eyes. (UPDATED)  October 27  2015By E. Moore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,UPDATE (December 14 2016): After using this laptop extremely heavily for over a year now it has help up beautifully. No scuffs scratches or breakage. No loose keys and no play in the keyboard touchpad or anywhere else. The screen is still working perfectly and the touchpad is still without hiccups. As for performance I have run several different OSes on this Chromebook and the 4GB of RAM is currently running Gallium OS without a hitch. Everything I do is snappy and quick. This ASUS C300 is hands down without a shred of doubt the most fun and reliable laptop i have owned. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something affordable capable and good-looking enough (let's face it the matte black on black is quite sexy) to still garner compliments over a year after buying it.---------------------------------Disclaimer: This is not my first Chromebook i purchased this one to upgrade from my Samsung Series 3.- AESTHETICS: The ASUS C300 is easy on the eyes. I purchased the all-black version and was impressed from the second i opened it. The matte black brushed finish is gorgeous and gives off the appearance that it costs more than it actually does. Anyone unfamiliar with Chromebooks would not believe that I only paid 250$ shipped for this machine. The matte finish is even extended to the screen which is anti-glare and does a very good job of it making outdoor browsing a breeze. Lastly the keyboard consists of chiclet keys that are set directly into the brushed matte-black base. It looks as if the keys are simply floating. I love it.The only aesthetic negative is that it is very fingerprint prone. Be prepared for fingerprint smudges. This doesn't bother me too much but i can see ho wit can bother some people.- FUNCTION: I've only had it for 24 hours but i've been using it non-stop. I also haven't charged it yet...according to the battery icon I still have 10 hours and 50 minutes of battery left. Sweet jesus. Definitely beats my Samsung Series 3's average of 6-7 hours.Everything is fast snappy and smooth so far. The  app/program loading and page loading is many times faster than my former Series 3. This thing is very quick. I currently have 9 tabs open at the moment and am experiencing no lag whatsoever. The Intel processor is a HUGE upgrade over the ARM.The multi-touch pad works perfectly. Each click feels solid. No play on my end whatsoever.- DURABILITY: Solid. It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy and feels nice in my hands. As i said earlier it looks and feels more expensive than it actually is.- RELIABILITY: I can't answer for this one yet as i've only had it for a day. I will be sure to update after a few months.OVERALL - HIGHLY recommended.,0

March 17  2016By K. B.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this Chromebook for my daughter right before Christmas. She loves it and never had a problem with it until a couple of days ago when all of a sudden its operating system disappeared. I followed all the instructions on the screen and tried to get it to work. After I tried to fix it at least five times (and nothing happened) I contacted ASUS. They could not fix it over the phone and recommended that I ship it back for repair. Customer service was very good they took care of all the shipping labels and ASUS is paying for the shipping. I'll update later...keeping my fingers crossed hope it gets fixed.Update: Asus fixed the chrome book and shipped it back to us within a couple of days. It works again!,1
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        18 of 18 people found the following review helpful       Awesome Chromebook.  January 23  2016By Joseph Dewey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm typing my review on this Chromebook right now. It's a really great computer. This is my third Chromebook and the best one yet. It's really awesome. I love the big screen size which is bigger than most which are 11.9. This is a full 13 inches. It's also extremely light and the battery lasts for about 15 hours with low screen and regular usage. It still lasts about 6-8 hours watching videos or doing high processing with a bright screen. And the battery charges super fast. I think it only takes about an hour to fully charge it from empty which is pretty amazing. One hour of charging for 15 hours of use. I don't even get that from a battery pack.I got the red color and that was my favorite. But I don't think you can go wrong with any of the four different colors. I also got the 4GB RAM option and I really notice a difference. With my older 2GB Chromebook then most social media sites would slow down and I had do disable Flash to get good performance. With this then it works great and fast even if I have 20 tabs open and Flash is churning on advertisements in the background.The only complaint that I have is that the space bar is pretty loud. I press it on the far right side. I'm not sure if I got a defective one or if it's a design problem with the keyboard. But it's holding up pretty well and still works. It just makes an audible click when I press on it.Overall I highly recommend this model. I already use a Chromebook every day so it wasn't a transition for me.,0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        10 of 10 people found the following review helpful       Like it a lot but consider the Asus Flip 10.1 if the screen and construction/look are worth the extra cash to you.  December 8  2015By CoachPM,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I just got picked up the 4 gb version in black on Cyber Monday for $179.  And at that price there really isn't much to complain about.The machine is very light for a 13 inch computer the battery life is great and with 4 gb it is speedy enough for all of tasks I plan to put it through.  The Google Drive storage is great for backing up all of my videos of the kids and with a 64 GB SDXC card installed ($19) I can keep a good deal of content saved on the machine too.This is my first experience with Chrome OS and I have previously been running Mac OS and WIndows 10 at home and at work.  Chrome OS is fairly intuitive and you can quickly learn what you need to know with a few quick online Youtube tutorials.  The Google App store works well and with the 64 GB card installed there is plenty of space to save apps and games.  I am an Amazon Prime member and this computer plays nicely with Amazon apps including the unlimited Amazon photo storage.The only cons are as follows:  Finger prints out the whazzoo the screen is really dull and lifeless and the plastic doesn't feel too sturdy.  But again this was $179 so I wasn't expecting much more.If I had to buy it again I would but I would also seriously consider the Asus Chromebook Flip 10.1.  The build quality seems much better the battery life seems comparable and the screen is several notches above.  If they were the same price (4 gb version of each) it would be a no brainer and I'd go with the Flip.  For an extra $30 I'd still go with the Flip.  When I bought the C300 the price difference was $60 and that is 1/3rd of the costs so for my $$$ and use this was the right call.,0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Digital artist and writer  first laptop!  June 16  2016By Brianna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is great! It's my first laptop so take my review with a grain of salt if you're trying to decide yea or nay.I'm a microsoft windows girl born and raised but I'm familiar with Apple products and this is a wonderfully refreshing experience.First I noticed reviews pointing out the lack of a caps lock so I made peace with that before this arrived for my birthday. Turns out you can go into the settings and change the search button into caps lock and other functions. I may not have looked hard enough through the reviews to see if anyone else mentioned that but I just want to say that.It does bother me that I can't figure out ""page up/down"" and certain other functions. But that's just a google away when I get fed up enough lol. Otherwise the keyboard is great and comfy.Second the combination of basic 15GB from google drive and the 16GB of the computer makes for a decent amount of space. But adding a 32GB sd card really really helped so that's a pretty good investment.It's so fast! Maybe it's just because I've been using a desktop I've had since 2008? But I love how fast things load.Third I chose a chromebook because I'm kinda tired of dealing with the windows OS (I didn't like Win8 and my husband has 10 on his laptop but I'm not sure how I feel about it yet) and I really dislike Apple. I was hoping that there'd be less unnecessary programs pre-installed and I was so right. Plus any that I didn't want after the fact were easily removed.I wish there were more options in customizing the theme of my background and computer colors but it's such a minor thing.And I wish stuff were able to open on their own without having to add to my browser tabs like google play and stuff. But it's also somewhat minor. The 4gb ram makes it easy to handle all this stuff running while I multitask. And it charges so quick! Plus once I turn down the brightness from ""Jesus is returning"" levels it lasts even longer. I can work all day from 10am to 10pm and still have 40% battery left.Fourth for my fellow artists who stumbled upon an affordable powerful little laptop. It has trouble with graphic tablets!You have to run ubuntu Linux to get them to work and wacom bamboo are the only ones I've heard cooperate. Make sure you research chromebook compatibility with different tablets. Although installing the art programs are an entirely different issue. I use Paint tool Sai which is strictly windows apparently. Haven't heard much about Adobe or Autodesk products but Gimp may work with Linux.Although if you just want to do photo touchups the Pixlr app is great. I used it on my phone first and made sure to find it for my laptop in the web store.I am having trouble getting my logitech wireless mouse to work but I have a simple plug and play wire mouse that cooperates so that's good.All in all for my first laptop I think this is really amazing and affordable birthday gift and I hope it lasts me a long time.Hope my review was helpful and made sense!",1

June 23  2015By Mike Tripoli",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"After looking at many Chromebooks with various processors memory size etc. I settled on the C300. I expected a bit of a ""toy"" but this has turned out to not be the case. The device is quick and responsive. The screen is matte finish which gives it a bit of a ""flat"" look; colors don't ""pop"" like they do on an IPS screeen but are very readable and clear. I used it a bit to look at movies and on a flight it would be acceptable.The machine boots very fast; I don't think I've made it to ""10"" when counting before the screen is up (from a cold start). When opening the screen it is instant on and connects to WiFi very quickly.The keyboard is a bit different from what one is used to on a standard laptop and takes a bit of getting used to. A ""getting to know the machine"" video on first use would be a great help. I had to Google how to ""right click"" (its two fingers on the pad). There are a few other things; Google ""Chromebook keyboard"" to get the details. The keyboard is functional but I don't know that anyone would set any records touch typing. A backlit keyboard would be VERY WELCOME (this is not). Also the labeling on the keys is done with silkscreen (or some other process; the characters look like the decals one would find in a plastic model kit from their youth). Double injection molded keys would last a lifetime as well as look 100% better and not very expensive (I design these things for a living so I know).The finish is supposed to look like anodized aluminum (which it does somewhat) but something I hadn't expected; it picks up fingerprints and smudges like crazy! Because of the slightly textured surface these are almost impossible to ""wipe clean"".I got the device about a week ago and after a full charge I haven't charged it again; this has been five (5) days. Use has been investigating using the device as well as checking email and a few cursory things nothing to tax the device particularly hard. All in all a nice little machine.UPDATE EDIT: I purchased this device on June 16th. As mentioned I charged it overnight and haven't charged it again until now it is June 27th. I have used the device every day on and off throughout the day checking email reading news stories looking for interesting apps on the app store (many many apps to choose from). I took it to Sears with me while waiting for my car to be serviced connected through a dedicated hotspot (an Ellipsis Jetpack via my Verizon account). For all of these uses the device has been outstanding. At one point my dogs (two puppies 5 months old) jumped on me while I was holding the device; I dropped it against a table and the back cover was scratched deeply (bummer for a new unit) but the device itself was unharmed. I am upping my star rating to 5 stars; this isn't a ""laptop"" but for everyday use and then some (I have installed both MS Word and Excel and they both look great) this is a very capable device. If you are looking for something small lightweight and relatively fast this is a great choice.",0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       If you have not yet tried a Chromebook  give this a try  May 24  2016By mocnozama,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is the second Chromebook I have purchased.  After years of using PC laptops I have found the Chromebook platform to be infinitely more useful for day-to-day tasks.  As pointed out in countless other reviews Chromebooks are not a replacement for those who need higher graphical or processing power (e.g. for pro-level photo editing high-end gaming etc.); however for web browsing email management and video consumption (i.e. netflix youtube) the Chromebook cannot be beat.The most significant differences in my opinion from a PC laptop are the start-up time and the battery life.  This Chromebook awakens to full use from being powered off in 3-5 seconds.  This Chromebook regularly gives 9+ hours of battery life--which is great however I have found that the battery lasts so long I sometimes forget that it needs to be charged leaving me with a low battery when leaving the house.  All other aspects such as wi-fi connectivity and web interfaces operate exactly as expected.As with all Chromebooks this suffers from a lack of processing power (compared to traditional PC's) which effectively means a significant drop in performance with 10+ browser tabs open.  However I found a chrome browser plug in called ""The Great Suspender"" to be the solution to this; as I understand how the plug in works it renders open tabs not used for a period of time effectively suspended thus saving on the memory drain.  When one wishes to un-suspend a tab using this plug in just click on the tab and it returns as it was prior to being suspended.  This gives me the ability to have 40+ tabs open at once with no memory drain.  It is a must-have app for Chromebook users.Overall if you have not yet tried a Chromebook and like something in the 13"" screen range you cannot go wrong with this.  Its incredibly affordable and as with other Chromebooks exceeds all expectations.",0

For the 200 dollar price of course that is to be expected.Keyboard ...the search key on the left hand side placement drives me crazy. Maybe its just me and I need to brush up on my typing but keep hitting it and the pop up box drives me Nuts! Normally there would be  Caps lock or something. I just hate it and wish the makers would put this on top of the keyboard because its an issue. Also can someone explain why there is a second Alt key on the right side instead of 'delete/DEL'?  Keyboard is a little cheap feeling and I hope this machine lasts me at least 3 years but otherwise happy with the quickstart up and locking feature (you will need your gmail password) to get in. DO NOT miss the constant Windows updates and fixes that constantly stalled my logging on...unless you need a Windows operating system for work.  This is a nice budget alternative for those of us who do not have the money for Macs.  ASUS just move the Search key somewhere else because for those of us who learned to touch type in school its an annoyance. Long battery life left it on a few hours and barely a dent in the battery icon. Very light plasticeasy to carry I was totally shocked and delighted how light it was. However I would purchase the care plan especially if you plan to take this on the road or travel. The only other added feature I would like to see in the future is backlit keys for those us with either old eyes or work in semi darkness.,0
Laptops,B01MG696PV,ASUS Chromebook C300SA Compact 13.3…,        2 of 2 people found the following review helpful       Brilliant value for money and fitness for purpose.  December 25  2016By Pat_P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I bought one several months ago used in good condition.Arrived ahead of time in better condition than expected no moving parts no fan no heat does not cook my lap like my work Dell does 4G of memory is 1/2 what my Windoze machine has so it is plenty for what it does; about 1/2 the processing  power too but here is the thing - no bloat-ware no daily updates no security updates no viruses so no anti-virus no delays starting up no delays shutting down and a decent camera with a time delay shutter not fabulous but decent for Facebook and such.  Not quite the same as Windows so it takes a little getting used to like no Function keys marked F1 to F12 and no delete key no noise no heat. It has been a learning curve however I was familiar with Google Apps. My wife is not technical so I thought if she can learn to use it after using a Microsoft Laptop for years (very slow always booting always rebooting always updating always virus checking etc. etc..... I bought her one. She took to it like a duck to water. We both have Apple iPads too. Similar battery life to an iPad. Light on one's lap and light to carry around. Apple works better in complete darkness because it does not have a backlit keyboard so I bought a USB flexible light at MicroCentre for about $4.  All in all very happy. It has a full size keyboard bigger than my work Dell so my fingers have to be a little wider apart when typing.  Keyboard is a little chiclet-ty but has positive feedback and is quite serviceable. I use it daily and frankly it outperforms my $1600 Dell/windows machine in almost every aspect. Of course it cannot do certain Windows proprietary functions like run Windows Apps and Windows corporate VPN programs that rely upon Windows Active Directory and Windows scripting because it is not Windows and does not run Windows and consequently also does not suffer from all the weaknesses that Windows has.  I find it a daily pleasure to use. at startup about 5 seconds to get to the login screen and about 5 seconds to shut down. Can also dim the screen till it blanks meaning you can stream video shows and listen without wasting power. Perfect fitness for purpose in my case. The only reason I still use Windows is that corporations are locked into Windows.,0
Laptops,B01HZT6AR0,ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360CA-UBM1T…,        170 of 189 people found the following review helpful       A ZenBook to Flip over if you're okay with initial IT headaches  November 12  2016By The Pool Man,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This is a longer review.  If you're in a skimming mood scroll to the bottom and read my second complaint first.  It's critical you do.  It took this five star unit down to three stars.  If you're willing to do what I did you can add a star or two back on my review.-- BACKGROUND --I was EXCLUSIVELY a Mac guy from 1986-2015.  (How's that for stubborn?)My wifey needed a 15 inch PC laptop for specific Windows software.  The only Mac 15inch is two grand and I just couldn't let Apple be that greedy.  So I tried a previous version of this ZenBook (UX305FA).  Loved the hardware but 8.1 was SO TERRIBLE I returned it to Amazon on the grounds of unacceptable OS.  I'm not a Mac snob.  It was simply terrible.When Windows 10 came out I had hope.  Got a K Series Asus Vivobook to try again.  The Vivos don't compare in quality to these ZenBooks but it was a 15 inch something like the Mac (i7 256ssd) for only $799.  Turns out Windows 10 was stable easy on the eyes relatively intuitive.  YES there's a pack of privacy settings one must flip to feel less invaded and you'll need a geek to turn Cortana off if you're not cozy with her.  Google 'turn off Cortana Windows Anniversary How to Geek' if interested.As a Mac user I was weary of viruses and malware.  Not one of either in a year on two PC laptops.But the overall success turned this Mac guy into a fan of Windows 10.  The result was that I treated myself to that ZenBook again.  It's not as good as macOS Sierra but it's better than iOS.  I'll never let my iMac go but these Asus PCs have been very reliable.So over a year has passed and I wanted to switch my wife from the big clunky Vivobook to a ZenBook like mine.-- REVIEW --But THIS ZenBook is a serious upgrade from the very well received UX305FA.  (Google and you'll see it's on various best of lists.)This ZenBook UX360CA has the same beautiful dark plum metallic body of its predecessor but now offers a glass screen instead of a matte display.  As fond as I am of my matte it does wash things out.  Causing eye strain.  And matte seems fragile around things like pens and pencils.  People complain that glass is a fingerprint magnet but glass is easy to clean compared to matte.  Rub a dub and you're done.A big change is that a touchscreen is now included.  It's not a feature that will be used a lot but HEY it was added without increasing the price.  So too is the flippity flip nonsense -- a feature that I think exists solely to make Apple look silly for not offering it.I will tell you it feels really ILL-ADVISED to turn this thing into an 'iPad' -- because your keyboard keys are now leaning against everything unless you're holding it just the exact right awkward tricky magical way.  In other words -- HORRIFIC ergonomics.  Tent mode might get used here and there but really this entire world is gimmicky.  (I found the best use for touch is if you want to adjust something on someone's PC -- because you don't have to tell them to get out of their seat.)The screen is absolutely beautiful.  That yummy Mac feeling.  Yes -- it's only 1080p -- but that's more than enough resolution (and color!) for an affordable unit like this.  The same can be said for the Core M and SSD.  VERY fast for surfing email and LibreOffice stuff.  If you're a filmmaker or gamer you should be looking at the ZenBook 3s and not pissing and moaning over here.This unit is great for most 'normal' people who want a fast SILENT laptop with good battery life.COMPLAINTS1.  I must have contacted Asus 5 times about how critical it is to have their F-keys enter his century.  That is:  these F-keys along the top still require you hit the function key below PLUS the F-keys above to raise or lower VOLUME or BRIGHTNESS.  SO INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.  Macs and many PCs do it the easier way.  Why so stubborn Asus?!?What took me a few days to notice is that they sort of fixed one of these issues.  There's now a volume rocker on the left side of the keyboard.  Just like a smartphone.  The bad news is that when you push down on the lower half of the button... wait for it... the volume goes up.  Just like when you push on the top half of the button the volume goes... down.(This is me rolling my eyes and throwing my hands up.)2.  I've docked this unit TWO STARS (from five) because Asus is shipping these units with a corrupted image.  I know this because I had to go through two of them.  If you're like 'What's a corrupted image?' keep reading and only mildly panic.A corrupted image means that when Asus installed Windows 10 on these computers -- they never bothered to check if Windows 10 was installed properly.  Skipping that time consuming step costs less for them and apparently they pass the savings onto us.  The problem is that if you're not so PC or tech savvy -- you're being shipped a mildly broken unit.  And you might not ever realize it until things really break.Don't panic.  Yet.  Google ""How to Repair Corrupted Windows System Files with the SFC and DISM Commands HOW TO GEEK"".  That website breaks how to do what I'm about to tell you.STEP ONE  Before you update your Zenbook or really do much of anything -- run an SFC.  (As explained in that article.)  It's really easy to do if you have half a computing clue.  If you don't it's a breeze and very familiar to any PC geek friend.  Since this laptop is Core M it will take about 7 minutes to complete.  When it's done it might tell you system integrity is okay.  If that happens run it again and make sure you get the same result.  If it's the same you're done and your system isn't corrupted.  However if it comes back with 'corrupted files' and mention of 'CBS.log' you have corruption.  (This happened on two of these units in a row.  Yes I returned one and got it again on the second unit -- which is how I know this isn't a fluke.)  And so --STEP TWO -- you now need to run a DISM.  (Again this is explained in that HOW TO GEEK article.)  This will attempt to fix those corrupted files.  On my first unit DISM gave me an error message indicating it couldn't even try.  If that happens to you RETURN your laptop to Amazon.  If it doesn't give you an error message upon completion it might indicate all is okay.  DON'T trust that message until --STEP THREE -- you've run yet another SFC.  If the SFC is no longer talking corruption you're done.  If it isn't --STEP FOUR -- you have to ask your PC to install Windows all over again.  I know right?  But since you haven't installed jack on this PC yet it's a no sweat scenario.  That HOW TO GEEK article explains what a system reset is and you want the one that utterly wipes everything.  That is:  it doesn't keep your personal files.  A fresh start.  Allow under an hour for this process providing you have solid bandwidth.  If this process fails to happen send unit back to Amazon.  If this process works --STEP FIVE -- you're going to run an SFC yet again.  For me that SFC worked and reported all is well.  I was so paranoid at this point I ran it even again even -- lol -- but the Zenbook was very happy this time.  Computer FIXED.  If yours insists on corruption send it back.There's even one more IT headache but I'll share this as a separate issue in a moment.  Let's take a break and talk about sound.3.  I forget to mention the sound has been tepid on these products.  I think it's gotten better but what I recommend is a small bluetooth speaker from Anker that's typically like $20.  If you put this laptop in a bag stick that in there too -- it's the size of a ping pong ball.4.  Okay.  The final IT headache is that if you're all set with corruption the resulting installation isn't current.  It's a buggier version of Windows 10.  So if you ask this unit to update it will... but only to a point.  Not up to the Windows Anniversary edition.  There's a method to download that version at the Microsoft site.  I tried it and it seems to work fine.  And yes... if you've been paying attention and are intuitive... you're damn right I did YET another SFC.  And all is well.  One tangent bit of advice is the very moment you get an SFC happy install -- create a restore point.  That's super easy even if you're clueless.  In the search field look for 'create a restore point' and do it.",0

This is one of those rare occasions. I researched computers for three weeks before making my purchase and when you combine price and functionality this is the best that i found. I've had my Zenbook Flip for a week now and I'm still excited about it. Battery life is exceptional it's light weight easy to carry and intuitive to use. The only thins that is taking me some time to get use to is when I pick it up my clumsy fingers change the tab on the open window. This is all in the way I pick it up though. This is a product I would recommend for people who do a lot of traveling.,0

January 15  2017By Richard Mantz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this as a gift for my wife. I wanted something light and fanless as she often has it on a pillow or blanket which blocks the cooling slots.This is a really nice PC both in laptop or tablet mode. I would love to replace my own work laptop with the Zenbook. i might need a little more processing power than the M-series in this one but only because of running SolidWorks on occasion. For day-to-day use this computer is outstanding. I did purchase a bluetooth mouse as she like that when using as a laptop. She is very happy with it which makes me VERY happy!,0
Laptops,B01HZT6AR0,ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360CA-UBM1T…, Rock Solid and excellent laptop.  January 30  2017By JaseVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This laptop was purchased for basic business computing not gaming.  For what the laptop is being used for it is an excellent machine.  Lightning quick silent very user friendly.  Track pad is very responsive and accurate.  PC runs very cool. Have been using it constantly for a couple hours as I write this review and case is cool to the touch everywhere.Only gripe that I have thus far is that a PC with this price tag would be nice to come with a back lit keyboard.  However I knew before I ordered that it didn't have this so it obviously wont affect the start rating I gave.Other posters have mentioned having corrupt system files upon delivery.  I ran the same scans and no issues.  So ASUS either corrected the problem or I was lucky.,0
Laptops,B01HZT6AR0,ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360CA-UBM1T…, very good battery life  January 15  2017By LinaVerified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Pros -lightweight very good battery life decent sound overall fast performanceCons - really noticeable backlight bleeding phenomenon both at left upper and right lower parts of the screen -perhaps not big deal for those who mostly use this laptop for office applications but if you work with dark screen or watch movies it may become really annoying.I am thinking about return as I find this level of quality below acceptable. It seem to be a known problem of Zenbooks of previous generation which ASUS did not bother to fix. If not monitor bleed I would call this laptop close to perfect ( addition of backlit keyboard would be big plus),0
Laptops,B01HZT6AR0,ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360CA-UBM1T…,        22 of 26 people found the following review helpful       A Bargain: SSD  screen  battery  trackpad  and tablet mode are all great! (4/5 green stars)  December 15  2016By JKay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I wanted to get a new laptop with a super-long battery life that’s also easy on my eyes and I’d heard that a good IPS screen can help reduce eye-strain. I’ve used it every day for a few weeks now and I’m completely happy with it. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:• Looks: very thin but sturdy aluminum body just under 3 lbs. I was surprised to see that it came with a case – a nicely designed envelope-style sleeve with a flap rather than a zip (photo below). The power pack is also nice and small.• The screen is beautiful. I do find it less strain to look at this high-res IPS screen compared to my older laptop. I switched to eye-care mode and love this setting – it manages to be vibrant and easy on the eyes at the same time!• Battery life is as advertised: 10 hours of moderate web browsing and document editing. Laptopmedia have tested the battery and said that it has very high endurance (better than the UX305) so I’m hoping it’ll maintain decent life for 5 years (my old Asus battery had good longevity too).• It starts up fast and so far the processor has no trouble handling everything I’ve run.  I love that it’s completely silent – a SSD is definitely a plus these days.• Tablet mode is great and adds a lot of value. It switches over smoothly disabling the keyboard and switching the display format automatically when you fold it over. I’m glad I never got a tablet – now I have everything in one!• I actually love the touchpad – if I switch back to my old laptop I wonder how I ever did without the multi-touch gestures! It really speeds things up for everyday things like scrolling.Cons (all minor):• Microsoft is a bit pushy with their Edge browser Cortona and OneDrive cloud. But it’s easy enough to ignore them and set your own preferences.• I read that the non-touchscreen Zenbooks are more matte and less reflective. However I don’t find the screen to be that reflective even on low brightness.• The trackpad is sensitive so sometimes when I’m trying to scroll it zooms instead. I got used to it quickly though and it doesn’t happen so much now.I’m also rating this laptop from a social and environmental impact point of view and based on everything below I’m giving the Asus ZenBook 4/5 “green” stars. There’s room for improvement but to be honest I don’t think there is a laptop out there yet worthy of five green stars (except perhaps the rarity of one made from recycled/reclaimed parts). Looking at how they are ranked on other sites: Ethical Consumer and Rankabrand both rank ASUS at the top along with Apple (and HP is close) with Dell and Toshiba at the bottom of the pile. After spending a few days researching both ASUS and Apple from their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reports and other sources I generally agree with this assessment: better than average but could do better. Therefore 4/5 green stars!There are many things to look at from the mining of metals to worker welfare to recyclability. But one of the most basic things is product longevity and in my experience ASUS laptops are built to last and should provide 5 years of life or even longer if you are resourceful and upgrade a few things at that point. My last ASUS laptop is 5 years old and still fully functional. The battery is inside the body of the ZenBook but ASUS will change it for you if you don’t feel comfortable taking the back off. Note that a modern lithium battery lasts longer when you DON’T discharge it fully. ASUS laptops are designed so that the processor memory and interface cards can be disassembled with simple tools and ASUS have a recycle program of course. They’ve rebuilt over 1200 used laptops and donated them to schools and also donated laptops to the Unlimited Potential (UP) program for women in Taiwan.Conflict metals are a big topic in electronics. ASUS have responded well to public pressure and for 2015 report that 90-100% of gold and tantalum are CFSI accredited and 70-80% of tin and tungsten (I’ve included a graph on this at the end). Apple announced at the end of 2015 that all four metals are 100% accredited by CFSI or another agency. Both companies do a pretty good job at transparency on hazardous chemicals in their final products and have made a lot of progress towards elimination of several of them such as phthalates beryllium lead and PVC. ASUS produced the world's first lead-free and halogen-free motherboard. They each have their strengths in this area (Apple had to improve following media coverage of problems in the past) and I think they are both above average.Total greenhouse gas emissions (for core company operations) have decreased significantly in the last 5 years for both companies – Apple does this mainly by increasing the amount of green energy they buy or generate while ASUS appear to do it by conservation and keeping their footprint small. I prefer the latter approach since even green energy has an impact (e.g. solar panel construction). By 2013 ASUS had reduced their core greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below 2008 levels. ASUS headquarters received a Zero Waste certification from UL in 2016 (85% Landfill Diversion Rate with 10% Incineration with Energy Recovery) while Apple’s number for 2015 is 63% office waste diversion. According to 2015 audit results there were no violations for Child Labor across the ASUS supply chain.The ASUS UX360CA has an energy star certification; laptops expend very little energy these days compared to some things like clothes dryers. The battery capacity is 54 wh so if you charge it every second day you’ll use a total of 10 kwh annually - this produces around the same greenhouse gas emissions as burning one gallon of gasoline (and costs less than $2 a year). The product packaging isn’t as neat as Apple’s but they use only small amount of plastic and clearly label it as #2 or #4 to help with recycling.,1

Love,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This baby just showed up yesterday and I swear to God that when it did the clouds parted the angels sang and my life got 3000x more efficient. I need to preface this with the fact that I'm a real penny pincher and tend to be 3 generations behind the technological curve at all times so I was sporting a dinosaur of a Toshiba Qosmio before this. I was okay with playing my games on ""mediocre at best"" settings.Then this dude showed up and everything changed. There are some really important things the more casual purchaser needs to know about. First off the speakers are loud. Not ""are you sure this isn't a jet engine"" loud but loud enough to fill a living room with decent enough decibels. Being an audiophile I thought the audio sounded a bit thin out of the box but there's an equalizer program built in so you can do whatever you want with the sound.The screen is matte. For the less in the know consumer you should know this means your screen will not have a shiny finish.  This may not sound like a big deal  but a matte screen means a largely glare free experience without adjusting the screen position until doomsday to get rid of that awesome gray shade that traditional screen finishes like to cast if you're not looking at the screen just right.I'm a fan of shiny things too and the keyboard backlighting situation is basically the coolest thing I've ever had the pleasure of tinkering with. You can change the color of the backlighting  y'all. It can color cycle. Like a trendy mood lamp. For many people this is dumb. For me it's a source of great glee. It's also a very satisfying keyboard all around.It's also superbly light. It's at least half the weight of the laptop I had before. Also the charger cord stays in firm and won't just fall out whenever it feels like it. The power supply box attached to the cord is also pretty small and inconspicuous.I can now play all my games on ultra. I can see colors in my games I didn't know existed. For this price I don't think you can get a lot better. I shopped around for weeks before settling on this and I couldn't be more pleased.I'm sure there are nitpicky things the more hardcore audiographicphiles could complain about but holy sweet fancy Moses this thing is a game changer for me. As a fairly hardcore gamer who has worked with subpar equipment for a long time if you're in the same boat as me and thinking of taking the plunge don't hesitate.",0

I looked for help online and saw an update made to GPU drivers of the nvidia 1050ti on january 24th I downloaded the new drivers and uninstall the old ones and everything seems to be working fine so far.UPDATE:Turns out I have been playing games with my Intel HD graphics card and there is a code 43 for the Nvidia GPU display.I would hope that ASUS handles this GPU driver issue in a better way as I have seen I wasn't the only one experiencing this.,0
Laptops,B01MQYO6QQ,"ASUS ROG Strix GL753VD 17.3""…", Not sure yet  February 19  2017By TerryVerified Purchase(What's this?),3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This is an initial review as I've only had the laptop for 1 day so far. My old laptop was starting to crap out and it was time to replace it.  Some initial items that stick out to me on this laptop.  The touch pad is much more sensitive than my previous laptop.  The pointer jumps sporadically at times from the slightest movement.  The 10 key pad for numbers has the zero one spot over from the usual 10 key set up.  For someone like me who does 10 key without looking this is going to be annoying.  The num lock key and cap lock key don't have an indicator light so you don't really know if they are activated or not until you type something.  This is already annoying.  The battery is lasting only two to three hours. It was advertised at four to five.  The screen froze today while watching a youtube video. I couldn't escape out of it or alt control delete to end task it.  I had to do a hard reboot.I plan on using this laptop for work related stuff as well as games.  I'll update my review up or down after more use.,0

I started it right up and have been gaming with it since and honestly does not get warm or hot and is even quiet while playing. I really like all the Asus utilities that come with it are very nice and let you control everything from fan speed to clearing up memory. It lets you monitor heat source and all spots of heat on the CPU and GPU. I hope to have this laptop for many years and I will say if you are one of the people who have had a issue with your laptop I would say to give it one more try and swap it for another one. It is a great system and all BUT the only ONLY thing I wish was different was the case. My monitor case feels like it is made with steel but the rest of the system feels like hard plastic but looks like steel. Overall I highly recommend this and say for the price you will not get anything better.,0

February 3  2017By daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Had this for a week.  Have had many gaming laptops over the last 10 years.  This one works as good as advertised. Very please with it and certainly priced well for what it is capable of.  Will highly suggest for any gamer though.  Go with the ssd.  ssd vs hdd is like comparing day to night.  Mine came with the hdd and I upgraded to ssd.Update.  I noticed it felt a little warmer than usual after playing Guild Wars 2  I reduced the graphics in the game to low and set the fps to  no more than 30  I also have this on a chill pad with 3 fans.  Sometimes it would over heat and shut down at random and sometimes it wouldn't.  But we all know if it starts over heating now after less than 2 weeks it will only get worse. I am returning this to Amazon. Wanting a replacement.  I love the design and was very happy with this laptop.  I hope it was just a fluke and they can either repair or replace and it doesn't over heat again.  Will update again once I have a different one.  If the over heating issue is resolved. I will certainly recommend this.  If it is not resolved of course I cannot.  I am still giving it 5 stars.  Very impressed with the design and how light it is.,0

Laptops,B01AWGXN00,Samsung NP900X3L-K06US…,        99 of 100 people found the following review helpful       Extraordinarily light  Great Keyboard  Great Screen  June 9  2016By Alchemedes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I waited over a month to write this review so that I could give a real appraisal of this laptops strengths and weaknesses.Strengths:So light you have to hold it to believe it. – Really. It is a liberating experience. Put this in a bag or backpack and you have to get used to the unnerving feeling that you forgot your laptop! My previous laptop was a Sony Vaio Z13 – no slouch itself in the slim and light department weighing in at 2.5 pounds. But the half a pound really makes this laptop a different ergonomic experience. For fun I handed it to my wife whose main charge is a surface pro 4. She was stunned at how light it feels. By comparison her surface (with keyboard cover) feels like a brick!  Not what we expected.It is not a tablet but I have found that it is so light that you can hand it to people to view a photo or document in an easy way that I couldn’t do with my previous laptop. The screen can be positioned 100% flat and built in software allows the image to be reversed for viewing. A neat trick and very easy to execute with the function key control.Incredible Keyboard Experience.  I am typing this review on the Samsung right now. I write a lot and want to concentrate on what I am writing and NOT what I am writing with.  Finally I have a laptop that doesn’t make me miss my desktop keyboard! The size spacing tactile feel travel of this keyboard works perfectly for me.Gorgeous Screen. The color vibrancy and detail of photos is something you have to see to appreciate. I work in an environment with bright fluorescent light and the brightness of this screen makes a big difference in readability from my previous laptop. Documents are clear text crisp. My desktop monitor is a 30 inch 2560x1400 resolution beast. I thought I would miss the higher resolution but I guess on a 13.3” screen you don’t really need it. I have no regrets over not having higher definition in this laptop.Powerful enough to get the job done.  As mentioned my previous charge was a Vaio Z and even though it is several generations behind in chipsets it still sported an i7 quad-core processor. Now after a month of putting this through its paces getting a chance to do all of the tasks I previously did with the Z I can report no sense of slowness lag or being underpowered. None. This laptop’s combination of chipset and ram are enough to allow me to seamlessly do my work. In fact some tasks are performed faster on the Samsung. Very satisfied using this as my main portable workhorse.Removable back panel. Beneath the panel you have access to the hard drive and battery. For those with the desire and aptitude to upgrade or change things this is a big plus.WeaknessesNo USB-C port. Not that I need one right now but it still would have been good to have. Other than this it has all the ports you would expect in an ultra-slim format laptop.NO 500 GB Drive option.  I wind up storing a lot of stuff on my laptop and I would have liked the option to upgrade from the 250gb drive that is offered. Offsetting this weakness is the removable back panel mentioned above. The drive can be replaced with a larger one if needed.Not an all-day battery. I have found that about five hours is what I seem to get. Now this is not a deal breaker for me in any way. I didn’t expect something this powerful with this great a screen…weighing this little to be able to pack a big enough battery to go all day. Meanwhile the included plug fairly light and the cord long enough to make carrying it and recharging easy.Bottom line: Ultra-light beautiful screen fantastic keyboard and powerful enough to use as my everyday work laptop. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.,0

So unknown to me this appears to be the same product line as Samsung’s ATIV series laptops. This was surprising to me because nowhere in the description of this laptop here on Amazon do they mention “ATIV”. What was also confusing is that other than the box it came in the word “ATIV” does not appear anywhere on the laptop itself. The model listed on its back is “NP900X5L”. So this is somewhat confusing.Other than the fact that this is Samsung’s ATIV series laptop there were no other surprises. The laptop looks exactly like the one pictured here on Amazon’s product page.Regarding the backlit keyboard: The 15-inch model that I received does NOT have a backlit keyboard. I also searched but could not find “backlit keyboard” listed as a feature anywhere in the description here on Amazon or Samsung’s product page. The confusion around backlit keyboard is likely because it appears that the 13-inch model includes it but the 15-inch one does not.*** The Good ***1. Weight - The first thing you’ll notice as you take it out of the box is its lack of weight. I have an 11-inch MacBook Air and this 15-inch Samsung laptop weighs noticeably lighter. It weighs about 2.9 lbs.2. Screen - The laptop has an absolutely stunning Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution! After its weight this is probably the most likable feature of this laptop. I also like the very thin bezel area around the display. This makes the screen really pop out making full-screen viewing much more enjoyable.3. Thinness - I don’t think it is the thinnest laptop but it is definitely one of the thinnest ones I have seen. I think its thinness is even more obvious with the 15-inch model. You can easily fit it in a manila envelope if it was wide enough to fit its width.4. Solid State Drive (SSD) - Although its drive is only 256 GB the good thing is that this is a solid state drive. Solid state drives are much faster than the older magnetic drives. Windows starts in seconds and everything is snappier because of the fast drive.5. Keyboard - Although the keyboard on the 15-inch model is not backlit I still love the keyboard on this laptop. Ergonomically it’s very easy to type on. It’s also possible that I like the keyboard on this laptop because it’s very similar to the MacBook Pro keyboard that I am used to.6. USB-C Support - This laptop is future-proof with the inclusion of USB-C port. USB-C is the next generation interface that will replace the popular micro-USB mini-USB and USB interfaces. USB-C is also expected to replace popular display ports like HDMI and Apple’s Thunderbolt. USB-C is anticipated to be widely available and supported by the majority of device manufacturers. Apple’s newest 12-inch MacBook also includes this port. Some of the newest cell phones (Nexus 5X/6P) and other electronic devices already include USB-C support. I love the fact that Samsung is including USB-C port on this laptop. Please note that only the 15-inch model has USB-C port. The 13-inch model includes a micro HDMI port instead.7. MicroSD slot - I like that Samsung included a MicroSD card slot - even though I would have preferred a standard SD card slot (See #1 under ‘The Ugly’). A lot of smaller cameras and cell phones include a MicroSD card slot so having this slot gives you quick access to transfer photos videos and documents.8. TouchPad - The touchpad is better than most Windows laptops I have used. I guess Samsung is trying to replicate the look and feel of Apple MacBook with these laptops. The touchpad looks very similar to MacBooks’ but when it comes to functionality it falls short. It’s not as responsive as MacBooks’ but definitely more responsive than some of the other Windows laptops I have seen in this price range. The touchpad recognizes multi-finger gestures. I’m used to scrolling pages with two finger swipes on the touchpad and it works really well on this touchpad. You can also customize the 4-finger tap and other gestures.*** The Bad ***1. Storage - If you like to store a lot of media locally on the laptop the mere 256 GB drive may not cut it. You will have to resort to either cloud-based storage or an external USB 3.0 drive. The slim body design of this laptop makes it difficult to upgrade and swap the drive if you are a do-it-yourself person like me.2. Backlit Keyboard - I do like backlit keyboards on laptops. They help you work in the dark. I think backlit keyboard should be standard on high-end laptops. Unfortunately this 15-inch model does not include a backlit keyboard so if this is a huge negative for you I do not recommend buying this model. The 13-inch model appears to include a backlit keyboard so you may check that out instead.*** The Ugly ***1. No SD card slot - Most laptops include an SD card slot but this one includes a MicroSD card slot - something I have not seen in a laptop before. Although it’s a good thing that Samsung included at least a MicroSD slot but not having access to a built-in standard SD card slot can be an issue for many who regularly transfer photos and videos from their cameras. A lot of cameras still use the standard SD cards. If the laptop had an SD card slot you could use an adapter and still use a MicroSD card but not the other way around. This means that if you want to transfer pictures/videos from an SD card you will have to use a SD-card to USB adapter similar to this one that I use regularly: Transcend USB 3.0 Card Reader. If you must absolutely have a built-in SD card slot you may consider the 13-inch model that includes it.The current price (of under $1200) for the 15-inch model is about right where it should be for a laptop with the features included with this one. Although it does not include an SD card slot you’ll still be able to transfer media and files if you use MicroSD cards. I also do not consider the lack of backlit keyboard to be such a huge issue (for me) given the fact that this is a very light laptop perfect for use on battery when traveling.Overall this is an excellent laptop. I highly recommend it if you need a thin lightweight Windows 10 laptop.=== UPDATE 03/18/2016 ===With some Windows laptops you get a lot of bloatware/junkware/crapware (whatever you prefer to call it) or even spyware. I think Microsoft has tried to control (to some extent) what gets installed on these laptops by manufacturers (such as Samsung). In the days of Windows XP/7 whenever I bought a new Windows laptop for myself or someone else the first thing I used to do was clean-install Windows or manually remove as many of those unwanted software as I possibly could.With this laptop the only unwanted application that I needed to uninstall was the Norton Anti-Virus. Microsoft Windows 10 comes with a solid antivirus and firewall (called Windows Defender) that is natively installed and fully supported and updated by Microsoft. You do not need any additional antivirus utilities. The Norton software that came with it was a 30-day trial that started bugging me to pay for subscription right from the start so I wasted no time in getting rid of the nagware. After I uninstalled it and rebooted the laptop Windows Defender took over downloaded updated definitions and started a quick scan to make sure everything was okay. Perfect!=== UPDATE 03/21/2016 ===When I wrote the review the selling price here on Amazon for the 15-inch model was about $1200. Currently it is selling for $1100 while the 13-inch is still listed for $1000. With only a $100 difference I recommend getting the newer 15-inch model if not having a backlit keyboard and standard SD card slot is not a huge issue.The laptop seems to hold its charge well except for when playing HD videos. Since the video memory is shared if you play a lot of high definition videos the i7 processor goes into overdrive and uses more power.I also wanted to let people know which sleeve fits it. I first ordered the 15-inch AmazonBasics sleeve but that turned out to be too large for it. The AmazonBasics 14-Inch Laptop Sleeve fits the 15-inch laptop perfectly. If you are looking for a sleeve this one is great choice.Overall this is a great laptop and I cannot recommend it enough.=== UPDATE 03/31/2016 ===I have been putting this laptop to work to test and see if it can ever replace my personal MacBook Pro that I use regularly. This laptop's thin design and paper-light weight makes me want to keep coming back to it. It is just too enticing! :)Here are some additional thoughts as I continue to use it:The battery seems to hold up. As with any laptop manufacturer you will likely never achieve the advertised run-time (i.e. 12-hour) with this one. The only way to achieve it would be to not do multi-tasking have only one application open (like the Edge browser) and not use any multimedia.I had this laptop charged in the morning and used it throughout the day for several hours - not continuously but on and off. I primarily browsed but also watched news videos on CNN and MSNBC as well some YouTube videos. The battery is pretty good. I even forgot that it was not plugged in until it warned me when only 10% was remaining. I would say that the battery lasts about as long as my MacBook's. If your normal workflow is not more than 30% multimedia consumption the battery on this can last the whole day easily but you have to be extremely conservative about the apps you allow it to run in the background.Lastly since it has a Type C USB port and because several devices including I think Google's Pixel and the 12-inch MacBook laptops can be charged using their USB-C ports I was curious to see if this laptop can also do the same trick. But sadly USB-C port doesn't charge this laptop at all. Not a huge disappointment because this is an not advertised feature. However it would have been really great if Samsung allowed it to be charged using the USB-C port in addition to the supplied AC adapter.,0
Laptops,B01AWGXN00,Samsung NP900X3L-K06US…,"        59 of 65 people found the following review helpful       15"" Review  April 23  2016By Neo",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Summary: Great compact laptop for everyday use. I use it as a graphic work laptop.+Great screen with thin bezel+Good Performance+Thin compact design+Variety of ports+Decent Battery-M.2 SSD is SATA3 not PCIe NVMe-No 512GB option-No dedicated GPU-8GB RAM-RAM not expandableScreen:At 1920x1080 screen shows great colors. Photos look great. It isn’t touch screen or high resolution 4K screen. From my experience I think screen size makes bigger impact than resolution for laptops when you need more work space. It is a great screen; however texts have appeared blurry for unknown reasons. I experienced this from installation screens for Adobe softwares. I currently do not know what causes it but it is little distracting to see really nice 1080p screen suffer from blurs like I saw. Strangely everything else is clear including photoshop illustrator web and word processing. Another screen issue I found little distracting was backlight. While on battery with under 50% brightless during the night I can clearly notice when backlight is trying catch up to dim itself or brighten itself whenever going back and forth from mostly dark screen to mostly light screen. For example minimizing full screened photoshop with dark gray work area. I thought it was a hardware flickering issue when I first noticed but it is an actual hidden feature to save battery life under Samsung Settings app. It is less noticeable or during the day with 75% brightness but still there if you are on battery power. This issue is non-existent while charging or with setting turned off.Graphics/GPU:HDMI supports 4K resolution but it is HDMI version 1.4 and maximum refresh rate is at 30Hz. It's fine for typical web surfing or graphic work I do but it is a distraction switching eyes from 60Hz laptop screen to 30Hz 4K screen.Benchmark around the web shows Intel 520 included in this laptop is comparable to GeForce 840m dedicated GPU which is nice but not enough for latest gaming demands. To be honest I purchased this laptop for my graphic work so I haven’t tested any games on it. Apps like photoshop does utilized Intel 520 GPU in this laptop for little bit of extra juice. If you need a gaming PC you should look into desktop as mobile GPUs are no way near desktop GPUs and cost-to-performance ratio is far better on desktop.*update: working with 3D model in Photoshop doesn't see a big boost**update: In the original review I said there is a mini display port but it is not a mini display port. It is sad to report that this laptop only supports 4k@30Hz by normal port options. On the bright side there are USB 3.0 display docks in the market already and there will be superior USB-C versions soon.Sound/Speakers:I was expecting lesser speaker because of the size of the laptop. I was pleasantly surprised with sound output from speakers. It's on par or better compared to most laptops. Like all laptop speakers without mini sub built-in low frequency is absent but it's clear. Speakers are located on bottom sides. Sound is bounced off whatever surface the laptop is on so volume and quality greatly will be affected by what surface you use the laptop on. On hardwood or solid desk sound is decent for a thin laptop. On your lap or carrying around not so great. On wooden surface I was able to pick up some extra detail in sound I couldn't hear while carrying around or holding the laptop. Also sound does get distorted at max volume.Ports:15 inch comes with many ports unlike some other competitors. On the left it has charger plug USB-A (most common USB) custom mini gigabit network port headphone jack and USB-C. USB-C was one of the reasons I decided to go with this laptop. It currently isn't that useful but soon it will be. Sadly USB-C on this laptop doesn't seem to be supporting Thunderbolt 3.On the right another full USB and full HDMI along with micro SD slot. Minor inconvenience is that some ports are too close to each other. USB and HDMI port are so close together that it could be impossible to use both ports same time if your cable heads are too fat. Charging plug is even closer to USB on left side.Also bulky USB flash drives aren't welcomed due to thickness and port spacing.Processing/Performance:I am pretty impressed with the performance so far. It boots up from cold boot in about 5-8 seconds. Opens photoshop in about 3 seconds illustrator in about 5 seconds. Opening them with a file adds 1-3 seconds. My workstation desktop is an old Mac Pro desktop with dual quad-core and 24GB ram. This laptop outperformed my old mac pro with opening and editing 230+ mega pixel project I was working on. Only downside for my use is that multitasking will be limited because of 8GB ram. 8GB ram is shared with GPU and there is no way to upgrade because they are on-board without expansion slots. So far I’ve seen GPU take around 1.5GB of RAM when I was using 4K output.*update: Photoshop 3D model performance isn't good*Storage:SSD in this laptop is M.2 SATA3 not PCIe NVMe. Still good enough for most tasks. I was transferring about 26GB of files through old USB 2.0 storage and it managed to open photoshop and run everything else without taking a performance hit. Fresh out of box it had 199GB left for storage. With my work apps and other things minimum for my work installed and transferred over it currently sit at 158GB free space.Input Devices:Keyboard has decent spacing and comparable to full-size keyboard without keypad but still less comfortable than desktop keyboards I’m used to. Trackpad is large and smooth surface helps. It has no buttons on bottom like traditional laptop touchpads. Entire pad clicks and differentiates right click by where your finger presses (right bottom area). I’m not a huge fan of touch right click on Mac so I’m not a fan here either. It works but you could left click instead of right click. There are some extra functions built-in like holding finger on trackpad opens up additional navigation options which I haven’t found any usefulness from it.Battery Life:So far battery life is good. I have use it throughout the day and left it on while I was attending other things. Checked out 4K videos and did some heavy lifting on battery like installing from USB hard drive while using/doing other things. After 11-12 hours of using and idling (I never turned it off but it went to sleep once) I must have used 6-7 hours actively without trying to save battery life and yet still had 23% battery left. Battery life will depend heavily on what you do with the laptop. Samsung Settings app has some nifty battery saving options and tells you exactly how much power you are using.Extras:Only bloatware I removed was Norton and replaced it with Avira before it expired. Samsung Settings app is great. I'm surprised that it actually has useful options like sleep USB charging for phones auto-boot when you open laptop’s lid disable webcam completely for privacy and turn background screen black for even more battery savings. Options are not mindblowing but they are rather nice to have. Wondering which wifi network is faster at some random place? Samsung Settings app shows you theoretical max speed of wifi networks. It has a silent mode where you have option to turn down your fan usage of fans inside. I do not know if it goes completely fan-less or not because I usually don’t hear fans go off insanely loud. It’s already very quiet and it doesn't have much of heat issue.VS Competition:Other laptops I considered before taking the leap of faith were Dell XPS13 Asus UX303UB HP Spectre LG Gram 15”. I later narrowed it down to either this laptop or Asus which has best spec among similarly priced models. I ultimately decided on this laptop because of 15” screen portability and USB-C. HP Spectre wasn’t out in time I purchased Notebook 9 but looked like it would get i5 instead of i7 for similar price.Picture I uploaded are size comparison between Samsung notebook 9 15"" and Dell Inspiron 15""**UPDATE for accessories**USB-C to HDMI 2.0a Active Adapter 4K @ 30Hz bugged me so much that I gave this adapter a try. This works flawlessly for 4K @ 60Hz.AmazonBasics 14-Inch Laptop Sleeve I can confirm that this sleeve fits very well as mentioned in other customer reviews.",1
Laptops,B01AWGXN00,Samsung NP900X3L-K06US…,        23 of 25 people found the following review helpful       Super thin  thoughtful design.  Coming from a Macbook Pro  little regrets.  June 14  2016By Thai Dang,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,**Update: Targus 45W USB C Charger works perfect to quick charge this laptop and my Nexus 5x.  Got it for $29 and has foldable prongs.Upgraded from a 7 year old Macbook Pro finally been a long time coming.Pros are it's refreshingly light (amazing what they can do with a 15 inch laptop) the screen truly is beautiful in its color rendition and minimal borders (craigslisted my 1080p monitor because this one does the job almost as well just make sure to change display scaling back to 100%) the keyboard is comfy has a webcam and microphone in the normal spot on the screen (niggle with how Dell's XPS line does it) runs quiet side firing speakers are loud and sound great depending on the surface you place it on thoughtful collection of ports something I would've personally chosen if I designed the laptop upgradeable cheap m.2 SATA3 ssd (1TB for $250 on amazon) boots up in a couple seconds includes wired ethernet adapter clean thin modern design that isn't gaudy.Cons are the trackpad drivers aren't as well done as Apple's Macbook lineup (Windows laptops have come a long way though and this one is surprising good just not as good) the battery life estimate fluctuates quite widely from 10 hr to 3 hr but generally it should last a while even with its puny battery because of the low wattage components (they did sacrifice battery life at the alter of a light design) the material is like half plastic half metal feeling scratches easier than a pure aluminum laptop hard to find accessories compared to Apple's laptops like multi colored plastic cases etc Windows 10 is cool but still less polished than Mac OS X there are duplicate options everywhere (4 different locations to change 6 different power settings) and you have to be ok with tinkering with it to get it to work the way you want (persistent registry entries when you uninstall apps) and definitely glitches on the daily to troubleshoot.  I've used Windows before college so I know my way around and I like tinkering so it works out for me.Two years ago I would've never considered a Windows laptop they were too ugly the trackpads were inferior user experiences the display quality was lacking poor battery life and lol Windows 8.  Now I have a Windows laptop and I love using Windows 10.  Also sold an iPhone and got a Nexus Android 7.0 device.  There are so many choices out there if you want to try something new doesn't necessarily mean its better though it does give you more freedom over your devices than Apple's ecosystem with the tradeoff of less support accessories and one-off designs.,1
Laptops,B01AWGXN00,Samsung NP900X3L-K06US…,        4 of 4 people found the following review helpful       ... bought this notebook because i was looking for a nice light  portable web and word processing device  September 13  2016By Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this notebook because i was looking for a nice light portable web and word processing device. The oversized amazon box that it came in had some of that brown paper package thing but the notebook box itself while it didn't have any damages whatsoever was still sliding around in the amazon box. Taking the notebook out of its own box it felt very light (coming from a Dell Studio 1749) but not a cheap light a more high quality feeling but light. It doesnt flex the screen feels solid enough and while the keyboard travel is a bit shorter than what I am used to it doesnt distract from the experience of using it 9.5/10 times that 0.5 times I will say to myself ""wow the key travel is a bit short"" right when i press down a key and my finger hits a sudden stop. I turned it on and after initial setup and installation of updates this being my first SSD based laptop with Windows 10 I shut it down and booted it back up to check the startup speed. It booted up in about 5 seconds! I had to shut it down again thinking that I had put it to sleep instead of a full shut down. Again went to windows login in about 5 seconds. Again this being my first SSD laptop and coming from an old 5000rpm HDD my mind was blown. I enjoy the thinner bezels and the colors of the screen seem pretty nice and the display dims very very low and gets pretty bright as well the very low brightness level combined with the ""reading mode"" (found in the settings when you press the F1 key and makes the screen less blue and more yellowish) makes bright white webpages and word files easier on the eyes when using this notebook in the dark. The screen size combined with the 1080 resolution does make text in Chrome browser smaller than I am used to but changing the default zoom level in Chrome sorted that out. Bloatware wise it comes with a minimal amount that can be removed especially that norton anti virus. The speakers arent that great they are maybe just about adequate for what they are given the very thin and light design of the chassis but most of the time i use earphones anyway. The screen seems to be held closed by magnets? and when the laptop is turned off completely (not put to sleep or hibernated) it has this feature where when you lift the screen up it automatically turns on I do not know if this is a Windows 10 thing or a common feature among laptops nowadays but I like it. All in all I love it so far and the only thing I would wish for is a backlit keyboard I understand the 13 inch model has that but I would want it on this 15 incher. Also I noticed a couple times that the screen brightness randomly goes up and down a little bit while i was looking at a web page but some samsung updates got installed yesterday and i dont know if that issue was resolved but havent noticed it since then. Those 2 complaints combined is why i deduct a full star.",0
Laptops,B01AWGXN00,Samsung NP900X3L-K06US…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       Lightest on the market  perfect for Linux  January 12  2017By wonderchild94,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This has got to be the perfect laptop right now on the market ! First of all what will shock you when you pick it up is the weight. It's incredibly light so light that it feels like it's empty or made of paper ! I've done research for a few months before settling on this which means that I killed time in BestBuy and Microcenter and places like that lifting and checking lots of laptops and there is nothing out there that even comes close to weighing so little (1.9lbs). The design is simple but attractive (simplicity is generally attractive if you'll allow me a little aphorism) the body is quite rigid and the screen doesn't flex. The keyboard is very comfortable and very well spaced (I'm a programmer I should know...). No weird enter key no tiny backspace no tiny shifts... nothing like that everything is as it should be. I think the key press is soft for a laptop keyboard which I very much like that's another strong advantage in my opinion.Screen is an IPS which means it has great viewing angles. It can be very bright too I'm actually comfortable at 30-50% brightness. It's glossy so there is a little glare but not much certainly not distracting. The back cover can easily be removed there are some clearly visible screws so that's another plus in my opinion since you could upgrade things like memory or ssd. I haven't opened it yet though.In conclusion A+ for design and build quality.Now for the speed and software: it comes with windoze 10 obviously but I'm a Linux guy so I'll talk about that. Everything works out of the box ! My distribution of choice is Slackware I easily cloned my desktop (slackware 14.2) then shrank the windoze ntfs and put linux in the rest of the space.Here are the steps:1) shrink windoze C partition from windoze as soon as possible. Because of fragmentation it will restrict the minimum size. I was able to shrink it to about 100G.2) boot in linux (through EFI not legacy) create new partitions clone your roothome...etc ext4 filesystems using fsarchiver. Clonezilla didn't work well for me when going to a filesystem of different size but fsarchiver knows how to resize filesystems.3) install and configure grub in your linux and also create efi entry in the bios/boot manager (grub-install grub-mkconfig efibootmgr).That's it. I'm on kernel 4.4.x longterm branch and everything works out of the box: screen brightness volume wireless touchpad bluetooth. The only problem that I had was with a bluetooth mouse which would stop working immediately after connecting. It turned out there were some HID settings in the kernel so I recompiled with those and now I'm using a Microsoft bluetooth mouse 3600 with no issues ! Recompiling the kernel was pretty fast so I'm happy with the speed of this laptop as well.In conclusion: if you're a Linux user it's perfect. If you're on Windows this is still a superb laptop unless you insist on having touchscreen. I personally don't care about touchscreen on the laptop I have a tablet and phone for fooling around with that.This is by far the lightest and the most mobile that I've seen - Apple laptops are heavy.I've only had it for a month so I can't say anything about durability yet but so far I strongly recommend it.,0

It fits perfectly into the Amazon Basics laptop bag for 14"" laptops and also in the Amazon Basics sleeve for 14' laptops...with enough room for the AC converter. Obviously the 256 GB SSD is not a lot of storage but with a micro SD slot (along with 2 USB-3 slots and a USB-C slot) it is easy enough to extend the storage.The best laptop I have ever owned.",0

It's very lightweight - even lighter than the Surface Pro 4 with keyboard. The keyboard feels nice better than the Dell XPS-13 in my opinion. The SSD is easily upgradable - all the screws holding the bottom cover in place are exposed (i.e. not covered by rubber feet) and there are no pesky plastic lips to undo (well a few towards the back but those are easy to undo).I've always been an advocate for high resolution screens but at this screen size I think FHD is perfectly sufficient.It has a standard size SD card slot! This is great for avid photographers it's one fewer accessory to carry around.My only complaint is a proprietary AC adapter with a bulky power cable - USB-C power would have been nice.,0

The 13  August 18  2016By Clint Dibble,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I purchased this laptop after much deliberation. I am the opposite of an impulse buyer; this purchase was years in the making. I am not disappointed. The 13.3 Samsung notebook 9 is currently the lightest 13.3 that is available and while not the thinnest it is still very slim. I believe the reviews for this laptop are a bit misleading. While offerings from Dell and Asus receive negative reviews due to poor quality control and faulty hardware most of the negative reviews for the NP900X3L are due to software issues that are largely beyond Samsung's control. This was of no concern to me anyways as I am a GNU/Linux user. Mint 18 is great on this laptop.,0
Laptops,B01EGBAR4W,ASUS C201PA-DS02-LG…,        312 of 324 people found the following review helpful       A great Chromebook experience for a great price.  February 1  2016By GR,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought the Asus C201 4gb RAM model for 179 when it was on sale in December. After a couple months of use it's a wonderful Chromebook for the current price and is surprisingly a versatile device in an incredibly portable design. As many other reviewers have went in depth about the various pros and cons I'll touch on my own experiences and observations with the device itself useful add-on accessory recommendation and the functionality and productivity that ChromeOS and the Web App store are fully capable of.A quick summary is at the end if you just want to skim quickly for a more concise breakdown.OUTSIDE DESIGN OBSERVATIONS:COLOR- First off the color of the outside shell is a real dark blue with the ASUS logo in the center. Cosmetically it's a pretty sleek design that's also functional with its rounded corners holding the 11.6in screen. For some reason the color is darker than the images provided on Amazon would lead you to believe but it still looks nice. The outside shell can be a smudge magnet so you can get a protective cover to help prevent scratches dings and smudges.PORTS- There are 2 USB 2.0 slots on the right side and on the left side there is an ASUS proprietary charge port a MicroSD slot (capable of up to 128gb) a micro HDMI port and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Not including USB 3.0 or even the newest USB Type-C is a strange decision but for the current asking price it's not a bad trade off.SPEAKERS- The speakers are located on the bottom of the front which is indeed an odd position for speakers since the sound becomes muffled. Odds are though if you're going to want to listen to music or watch Netflix you would use a speaker system or headphones so this design choice wasn't a big deal to me since a lot of Chromebooks (Samsung Chromebook 2) have the same speaker design on the bottom.BOTTOM- The bottom of the case has 4 round rubber stoppers so this thing wont slide anywhere on hard surfaces. It's incredibly light weight sturdy and portable making it easy for both students and professionals to carry and use throughout the day.TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:DISPLAY- The display is 11.6"" HD at 1366x768 (16:9) screen resolution. As many others have commented on one of the first noticeable things is that the display has some weird viewing angles where the top parts can have darker colors wash out with the backlight and show weird contrast. It usually doesn't take long to adjust it where it doesn't have that washing effect making watching YouTube videos or Netflix practical for extended periods of time. Is it the best screen or ideal screen for binge-watching shows? Probably not but it's certainly passable for flights or whenever you have some down time to kill an hour or two and have no other means of watching video content.KEYBOARD- The keyboard is snappy responsive and comfortable to use. The plastic shell around the keyboard looks relatively cheap but it's surprisingly durable. I don't feel any kind of weird bending or anything off with the keys when typing so I don't think it's possible for keys to get stuck under the shell without trying or unless there's a manufacturers defect or user error. All the shortcuts you need are on here; refresh key backward and forward key for web browsing fullscreen window key program switching key backlight and sound adjustment keys the power button with LED indicator to the right of it and full QWERTY keyboard.TOUCHPAD- The touchpad is located below the space bar and covers a decent area i'd say about 1/3 of the bottom part which makes it easy to maneuver the mouse and use click actions like single tap double tap to hold and drag or can physically click to hold. It's capable of pinch-zoom and swiping left and right with two fingers to go forward or backward on a web page. It's also capable of other gesture commands which is typically dependent on the capabilities of the program in use. It's a well-implemented and functional touchpad for every day use especially for the price.BATTERY- This is one great key feature and for many a selling point; the battery life is incredible. I'm able to get on average about 11-12 hours of one full charge out of it with mixed usage throughout the week. Web browsing running various apps listening to music watching videos and it performs as advertised with the battery life. I didn't truly believe it when I read the specs but it certainly lives up to it. Obviously this is dependent on various factors so results may vary but with average use and maybe with brightness set in the middle you should easily be able to get the same amount of battery life as stated. This makes it perfect for travelling and for students who need a reliable net-capable device to use throughout the day without worrying about the next time you need to charge it. Video drains the battery the quickest so you'd probably be looking at around 6-8 of constant video streaming maybe more if that's all you have running on it at once. Needless to say though it certainly performs as advertised here.RAM and PROCESSOR- The 4gb RAM model makes running multiple applications and tabs at once much easier since it allows for better multitasking. The processor is a quad core Rockchip using ARM architecture which makes it less power-hungry than the Intel series chromebooks so this also helps with battery life since it's more power conscious than the intel counterparts. It runs at 1.8ghz which isn't as fast as some of the intel ones but it's comparably almost just as powerful for what it's commonly used for and is certainly just as capable without sacrificing speed or functionality.STORAGE- 16gb (eMMC for those who care) is soldered onto the board itself so it's not upgradeable (like the Acer Chromebook) with a new M.2 storage chip or anything. However the MicroSD card slot allows expandable storage up to 128gb.WIRELESS and BLUETOOTH- Wireless is current standards of 802.11AC and Bluetooth 4.0 LE capable. It also supposedly supports 4.1 but I haven't tested it personally.CAMERA- The camera is a front facing HD camera at the top of the screen I think at 720P with a mic to the left of it.CHROMEOS:When you first boot it up it will ask you to connect or create a gmail account this acts as your login information to keep you connected to the net and to Google Drive (and other cloud services) which is what the primary purpose of Chromebooks are to begin with. ChromeOS itself is a very simple and lightweight operating system that essentially thrives with online connectivity but it is possible to be just as productive while offline as well. The Web App store has plenty of useful (and free) apps that allow you to be productive both online and off. A handful of apps by Google are included by default but to get the most out of it some digging around on the Web App store is needed to customize it specifically for your needs.Here are some free Web Apps that I've found useful so far:GRAPHICS/PHOTO- Polarr Photo Editor 3 is a great photo editor that can be used offline as well and it's feature rich. It's comparable to a lighter version of Adobe Lightroom. Sketchpad is another fun one that can be used offline too and it's more for drawing than it is for photo editing. Pixlr Editor offers a couple of programs included for free and GIMP (GIMP uses rollapp and requires cloud storage services to be connected to it to be able to edit photos) both require online connectivity and they act more like a lightweight Photoshop but they're extremely useful and capable for quick image editing and adjustment. Wacom Tablets also work on Chromebooks but it recognizes the tablets as a mouse input since it doesn't install any drivers so you won't get the pressure sensing from the pens like you would on a Mac or PC though I suppose it's possible to get that feature in future updates.WORD DOCUMENTS- Aside from Googles ecosystem of Google Documents that's primarily used online (there's an offline mode you can set but it's not as fluid as some other free options) StackEdit is extremely useful since it can be used on and offline and saves automatically. You can also type in markup language and it'll show it side by side.  You can also export what you typed to Wordpress and many other blog services. Another good offline option is simply called Writer (the one with the blue circular logo and a W in the center) which is barebones simple and easy to use. It saves it's files in Rich Text (.rtf) format. OpenOffice Writer is also good and offers many options comparable to Microsoft Word but it can be used online only. StackEdit and Writer are currently my preferences. Another one worth mentioning is called Writebox which is pretty sleek and minimal that can function offline and can save locally as well. Amazon also offers one for free called StoryWriter and it's designed for screenwriting.VIDEO- VLC offers an app that expands the available video types that can be played. Plex also offers an app if you have an in-home media server setup that you can connect to. Chromecast also has an extension you can install to cast from your chromebook.SSH/SFTP/REMOTE- I use Serverauditor as an SSH client and SFTP FileSystem for local file transfers. Google offers Chrome Remote Desktop in the Web App store that allows you to control any computers you set up for it on the local network. You can set it up on the computer you want to control and you can log in to it from your Chromebook since it mirrors your Desktop screen and allows complete remote control of it.EXTENSIONS- FontChanger allows you to change the font for webpages that you can set up for either Global settings or Custom settings for individual web pages. Chrome User-Agent Switcher allows you to emulate many other browsers so this comes in handy if a page isn't optimized for Chrome you can switch it to Firefox to make the webpage think you're running Firefox. Ad Block is also a must-have to prevent a lot of annoying pop-ups and unwanted ads. Many companies (Pinterest Amazon) also make useful extensions to add-on.CLOUD STORAGE- Google Drive should be the default choice but Dropbox Box OneDrive and Yandex.Disk all offer free storage options.ACCESSORIES:These are some add-on items you might want to consider to either protect or enhance your Chromebook experience:COVERS- iPearl makes some pretty decent covers to help protect for daily use and they come in multiple color options. I purchased the Aqua Blue one and it certainly protects it from bumps and scratches: Amazon link to Aqua cover (but plenty of other color options)- iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case AquaETHERNET ADAPTER- Sometimes wireless wont be practical so luckily USB Ethernet Adapters have been made for Chromebooks for when you might need to hardwire it. TRENDnet offers a pretty reliable one for $13- TRENDnet USB 2.0 Wired Ethernet alternatively if you'd like to have additional USB ports and wired ethernet connectivity Unitek offers a slightly more expensive one for $20 and it's backwards compatible with USB 2.0 ports on this Chromebook- Unitek 3 Ports USB 3.0 Hub with EthernetMICRO HDMI to HDMI ADAPTER- Just in case you ever want to connect to a larger screen to stream Netflix or work on a larger screen/monitor.  You can also close the lid on the Chromebook and video content will still stream. Monoprice offers a simple adapter for $8.99- Monoprice Micro HDMI to HDMI AdapterMICROSD CARDS- These can be found between $20-$60 ranging from 32gb to a max of 128gb. These are useful for expanding storage of your Chromebook. The 64gb MicroSD card is a great value for $22- SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXCOVERALL SUMMARY:PROS:+ Sleek compact design+ Quick and responsive boot up and operation+ Lightweight and portable to carry+ Web Apps offer plenty of productive graphics and document options online and off+ Phenomenal battery life- 11-12 hours of mixed use+ Responsive keyboard and multi-gesture touchpad+ Well rounded portable experience from ChromeOS with plenty of room to grow.+ Constantly updated for the best stable experience+ Perfect for students travelers and just average daily useCONS:- No full HDMI- requiring micro HDMI to HDMI adapter to be purchased separately- No USB 3.0 or Type-C- Probably cost prohibitive to include at the asking price- Weird viewing angles for the Display causing colors to wash out towards the top4/5 Stars: -0.5 for display issues and -0.5 for ASUS proprietary power plug not including even one USB 3.0/Type-C or at least a full HDMI out.I hope this has been informative and helpful so you're not as lost as I was in choosing the perfect Chromebook!",0

I am a heavy Apple user but was eyeing a Chromebook for months as a lighter power-friendly alternative for both travel and bouncing around the office.  After doing a ridiculous amount of research I was expectantly awaiting the release of this model due to it's light weight and quoted 13 hours of battery life.  Now that it has arrived I'm happy to say that it has completely lived up to expectations on both fronts.  It is super light and lasts forever.  The build quality is also really solid for a sub $200 device.The keyboard and trackpad were both a great surprise.  I was initially unsure about typing for long hours on the c201's keyboard but within a few hours I was typing rapidly accurately and comfortably.  The trackpad is also a star.  It's comfortable and fluid and works about as well as the one on my Macbook Pro.  Overall both the keyboard and trackpad make the device a pleasure to use.I'm not a Linux user which is why I was comfortable going with a non-Intel chip but I hear if that's what you're after this may not be the processor for you.  I can say that with the 4gb version it has kept up to every task I've thrown at it so far (Netflix youtube tons of Google docs and browser based screenwriting apps).  In my opinion if you need much more you probably shouldn't be looking at a Chromebook anyway.  But if you're comfortable with the always-online nature of Chrome OS than this chromebook definitely has you covered in terms of performance.I could easily see this becoming the go-to device in the house getting more use than both my Macbook Pro and my iPad.,0
Laptops,B01EGBAR4W,ASUS C201PA-DS02-LG…,        56 of 57 people found the following review helpful       Great Secondary Device  October 26  2016By savvy shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,So far so good.  I have a gaming desktop that takes up a massive amount of space so I decided to move it out of the main living area and get a Chromebook for regular web browsing and travel.  This computer fulfills most of my day to day needs.  Thus far I've mostly used it for general web browsing online shopping YouTube viewing and Google Hangouts.  Strangely it's a little slow with Hangouts compared with my phone.  Not sure why.  Everything else does just fine.  I'm looking forward to taking this on the road for several weeks coming up.  The battery life is amazing compared with other devices that I have owned.  I feel comfortable that this will get me through my 3000 mile road trip with minimal opportunities for charging.  I haven't counted hours but I can go 2-3 days at home on a single charge.  I'd say that I'm cumulatively on the internet for about 3-4 hours a day so that would be approximately 12 hours of battery life easily.  I've yet to fully discharge the battery so that's probably a conservative estimate.  The other plus for traveling is that this machine is LIGHT.  Compared with my Samsung Tab (with the 12 hour battery that might last 4 hours) paired with a bluetooth keyboard the Chromebook is positively featherweight.  It's also far less clunky.  The fact that all my Chrome bookmarks themes extensions etc. came right over automatically from my desktop was an added benefit.  I'll be even more pleased when Google rolls out the ability to run Android apps on this model which I've read is supposed to happen sometime within the next year.  This is mainly important to me as it pertains to PDAnet and some language apps that I use.  The one drawback I've experienced to this point is that printing is kind of complicated.  My wireless printer is not cloud print ready so I have to route jobs through my desktop.  I haven't had the time or inclination to invest in setting that up so I just do my printing from the desktop for now.  In terms of storage the micro SD slot pretty much makes the sky the limit.  I have a 32 GB card in there right now which will most likely be adequate for anything I'm trying to do on this machine.  If I need more I'll get an additional card.  In terms of styling I was a little unsure about the blue ombre effect.  I was afraid that it would look a bit cheesy.  Now that I have the Chromebook in my hand though I like it.  It adds a little personality and keeps my grubby fingerprints from showing up as well as they would on a completely white surface.  The bottom line is that as a secondary machine this Chromebook does everything I need it to do at a minimal price point.  Perhaps I will post an update after my long trip if anything comes up but so far I am completely satisfied.,0
Laptops,B01EGBAR4W,ASUS C201PA-DS02-LG…,        61 of 64 people found the following review helpful       Great for a college student on tight budget; all the necessities  November 17  2016By Z,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I've had this ASUS Chromebook for about 3 days and I absolutely love it. It does all the basics that I need and want a laptop to do. I'm actually typing on it at this very moment to do a review. The pictures that I attached I actually sent from my phone via a very useful app called ""Pushbullet"".Size: Perfect for me personally. I went down a size from my last laptop that was around 13 inches and I have to say that this is just as good size wise. It is very thin so a lap desk would be best instead of just in your lap. The tread on the bottom is also kind of slick on certain surfaces though it DOES have pads on the bottom. It's just a very...slick laptop regardless.Typing/ Keyboard size: Good enough for me. I have average sized hands for a female and can still type as fast as I do on any other keyboard maybe even easier. Keep in mind that THERE IS NO CAPS LOCK BUTTON(that I'm aware of). I had to use shift to make that all capitalized. There are a few other not-really-needed keys missing like ""page up/page down"" but they are not a necessity and can be used with Control Commands (alt + up button/ down button).OS: You won't be able to do any hardcore gaming on this the Chrome operating system is pretty basic. You will need to download certain applications on the chrome webstore to open certain files (Example: you obviously need an emulator to play ROM games which yes I have been doing just fine.) I use this mainly for doing my schoolwork and essays via Word Online which is free if you give your student email. Everything is saved through Google Drive. I would recommend this laptop for a student-on-the-go with a tight budget but it has a lot of great recreational uses such as accessing spotify or netflix online. I'm still new to it so there was a learning curve with me the first 20 minutes or so that I had the laptop and I am still finding more and more useful things that it can do. It's so far super fast to load.Battery life: So far the battery life has been great. I've been listening to music for the last 3 and a half hours unplugged in my room and light searching the web and battery life is on 85% still. I think the time estimate of how long you have for battery life on the screen varies because of change in activities on the computers but supposedly if I continue to use this laptop at the pace I have been using it then there is approx. 9 hours left.To put it simply? As someone who has not had a fully functioning laptop in years I'm in love with this chromebook.",1
Laptops,B01EGBAR4W,ASUS C201PA-DS02-LG…,        23 of 24 people found the following review helpful       Super impressive and affordable laptop!  August 17  2016By Sarah A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I didn't think I'd be so impressed with a Chromebook but here I am to tell you that this laptop is pretty impressive. If you're a user of Google services and need a laptop to get work done this is an amazing choice.Firstly this is a Chrome OS laptop. Not Windows or Apple or anything like that so don't expect it to be exactly like something you've used before. It works on it's own platform that is obviously based on Google. That doesn't mean it's hard to figure out. It's actually a lot simpler to use in my opinion. The platform is straightforward and I figured out how to maneuver everything within thirty minutes of playing around. Now you're not going to find super complex programs and options like Windows and Apple but this isn't what this laptop is about. It's simplicity makes it a great option for the average internet user. It's also extremely affordable. About $200 for a great laptop? TAKE MY MONEY.I use this laptop for many things ranging from writing to watching TV. Because I am a huge user of Google Docs Calendar Keep Blogger etc. this is perfection. Everything is easily accessible and synced. I don't have much applications because I don't really need any but the Chrome store is limited. If you're an applications kind of person you might feel a little meh at the Chrome selection. However they're always adding more to the store. The WiFi is amazing too. It gets the strongest connection -- better than any device in my home and I've got a LOT of devices. It's also very fast. I can go through 20 different tabs on the internet and nothing slows down.It looks awesome. It's sleek thin light and attractive. I love the matte finish. Yes it does hold onto your fingerprints more easily than a shiny finished laptop but it's not that bad at all. Unless you just handled a slice of pizza before touching the laptop I wouldn't be too worried. It has all of the basic USB ports you'd need. The keyboard clicks nicely. Only downside is that the keys don't have a back light-- that kind of sucks for late night usage. The volume is also quite low -- not ideal for putting a video on and them going into another room or something. Not gonna bump down the rating for it because it's just tiny things.Overall if you're an average internet user who needs a reliable laptop for web surfing work note taking -- basically everything but super complex computer programming/gaming -- this is an excellent option for you. It's price along with what it offers is just amazing. A steal really.,0

September 1  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I almost bought a much more expensive chromebook but at the last minute I found this one and saw that it had everything I wanted great reviews and a great price. I love this computer!! It's sleek and portable fast and so simple. It took me maybe one minute to set it up and get online. It's perfect for what I use it for. I'm a student so I use it mainly for homework and occasionally for watching Netflix. This computer handles having several tabs open very well. I can flip between several different tabs quickly and without lag. The display is great it doesn't get hot when I use it for a long time and it adds no weight to my backpack. My favorite part is how long it stays charged. I barely ever have to charge it! Bottom line I'm so glad I got this little machine instead of a more expensive model. I definitely recommend it!,0

Ward,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This Asus machine is the best Chromebook for the money you will find. I shopped over twenty different Chromebooks from Eight different retailers before buying this one. I went for the 4GB knowing that I want it to be functionally adept for a long time. I am writing this review on this product right now. If you have a limited budget and want a quality device this is the one. SD storage mini HDMI extra large trackpad solid keyboard beautiful resolution lightweight speed comparable to Intel machines and crazy battery life. I ordered this machine late at night on a Friday from Amazon and it was in my hands before Noon the NEXT day. If you have not given serious consideration to becoming a Prime member you should do it now. Deals like this are rare and as a Prime member you get first shot at stuff like this. My windows 10 machine is a like a pickup truck compared to this sporty super fast device.,0

Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'm very happy with this purchase. I occasionally write magazine articles and wanted something that primarily worked as a word processor and has a good battery life. At first I was a little disconcerted that the only word processor was Google Docs until I figured out that this can be setup to work off line. There are other off line aps you can download but this works great since as soon as you connect to the internet it backs up the files on your google drive. I like the keyboard and the light weight of the device and the 13 hour battery life can't be beat. The wifi connection is fast even on cheesy airline connections and it is easy to use and to get to the apps you need the most is a breeze. Google really did the world a favor with the Chrome Book. Not all of us need a 2k dollar laptop that is loaded with software that you spend the first week deleting. I've owned many computers over the years from laptops that run Linux to a Mac tabletop. This one is hands down my favorite. If you want to know if this will work for you software wise all you have to do is try doing your work on Google Docs for awhile and if that is feasible this is your device. I'm not sure what all of the critisism is about. I understand it can be a pain to print from and I have not tried it yet but with Google Docs anything you put on it can be easily accessed and printed from another computer. I wish there was an Amazon Video app for it though there is an Amazon Music app. I havent tried to explore the ebook reader yet to see how that works but for what I wanted email word processing internet music etc it's perfect.,0

Laptops,B01EGBAR4W,ASUS C201PA-DS02-LG…,        7 of 7 people found the following review helpful       Excellent Value if you know what you are buying !  November 5  2016By DanC NJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've read many of the reviews before purchasing this notebook. If you know what you are buying and depending on what you intend to use it for it's an excellent value. I bought this as a lightweight internet appliance for lack of a better term. It suits my needs perfectly. However I do not need to print from it or stream video from the hdmi port. I've read reviews where others had issues with these two features. Other reviews were just plain clueless obviously not reading at all let alone doing any real research before purchasing. If you bought it for your teenager for him or her to load a bunch of windows based games you will obviously be disappointed but who's fault is that? If you expect a Windows OS or even a full featured Linux OS you will obviously be disappointed. Again who's fault is that? Maybe these reviewers need to give themselves one star.I was a little hesitant to purchase this set up with the Rockchip ARM processor. I was tempted to spend more for the same machine with the Intel chip in case I wasn't happy with Chrome and wanted to load Linux. I already have a Dell E4310 with a Linux/Win 10 dual boot so that is not why I was buying this. I really couldn't be any happier with Chrome and the hardware performance I installed a 32G micro SD for storage and it has done almost everything I've asked of it  and has done it well. The only issue i've has is trying to open .odt files created using Libre Office Writer in Linux. I managed to find an app to handle them but it's not an easy process.In summary this is a nice looking light notebook with a decent display and adequate keyboard and track pad. It's much more usable than a tablet in my opinion and of course the cost is  very reasonable for what you get. Set up takes no time if you already have a gmail account. Performance and battery life are both outstanding. I use the display at it's brightest setting and I still get 8 - 10 hours of battery on average. It is the perfect size for travel carrying around the house or using it outside on the porch or deck. I would recommend it to anyone who understands what a Chromebook is and what it's capabilities are.,0

Laptops,B01CQRNBJG,ASUS ZenBook Pro UX501VW 15.6-Inch…,        197 of 202 people found the following review helpful       Stellar laptop  but not ideal for gaming  June 18  2016By T. Blikstad,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I bought this laptop hoping to get something future-proof. I want to keep it for five years maybe more. After owning it less than a week (full disclosure) here are my thoughts so far:Pros:-4K screen: Not something I thought I would need but after using it for a couple of days it was almost painful to go back to my old 720p screen.-Hardware specs: i7 processor 500 GB SSD 16 GB RAM: This is high-end stuff and it shows in the performance of everyday tasks and heavy computations. Applications start up super fast and run smoother than butter.-Thunderbolt 3.0 port: Speaking of future-proof from what I read this is going to be the port of the future. It's super fast can provide tons of power and is idiot-proof (you can plug it in either way). This is basically the PC response to Apple's lightning port and it's pretty dang cool.-Form factor: I've always loved aluminum-body laptops and this one is thin and sturdy. The bezel around the screen is large (about 0.75"" - 1.0"") which makes the entire body bigger. It's not the size of a 17"" laptop but it feels solid on your lap. It's weighty but not heavy which is perfect for me.-The battery: This thing has a 96 Watt-hour battery. Do you know how big that is? It's huge! I have yet to run a full battery test but according to online reviews this lasts between 6 and 8 hours of normal use.-Heat management: I have yet to put this thing under heavy stress but the bottom gets comfortably warm streaming 4K video or under medium-level tasks. Asus's promo materials talk about some pretty top-level thermal management inside and the aluminum body helps dissipate even more. I don't see this laptop getting uncomfortably hot on your lap except maybe on some of the hotter summer days.Cons:-Gaming graphics: The graphics card (GeForce GTX 960M 2GB graphics card) is pretty near the bare minimum for 1080p gaming these days. I ran the Heaven 4.0 test on this laptop and it was putting out about 30 +/- 2fps at high settings in 1080p. Forget about using the 4K capabilities of the screen for gaming. If you're not a gamer this is not an issue as the laptop is capable of rendering any image you throw at it otherwise. But for future games this thing is going to struggle at high settings.-User-modify-ability: The case is sealed shut and even if you do get it open the important bits are all soldered in place. There is no user access to the battery graphics card processor or solid state drive. This means you can't upgrade any hardware over the life of the laptop. Fortunately you start with some of the very best available today. Note: most other aluminum-body laptops do not let you access these things either.Other things (not pros or cons):-The speakers: The speakers are pretty blah. They're not worse than your average laptop but Asus hyped them up too much. They're pretty weeny compared to what I was expecting.-The number pad: Others have complained about the number pad saying it was too skinny. It really doesn't bother me and I use the number pad pretty often.-The touch screen: The whole idea of a touch screen on a laptop is a novelty in my opinion. It's fun and it can be useful in a couple of circumstances but I would have preferred a cheaper computer with a regular screen. Oh well.-Backlit keyboard: Not an exclusive feature but still nice to have when typing or gaming in the dark. Note that it is dimmable.-The glossy screen: Others have complained about the screen being so reflective it's almost mirror-like. While I would agree it's not something that has come up. Unless you're watching a very dark movie or using the laptop outside in the sunlight you're not going to see your reflection. It hasn't bothered me at all.-The placement of the right arrow key is funky. Because it is aligned with the number pad it's spaced farther out than the left arrow key is. It's not horrible but it is very weird.All in all this is a very good laptop. I am pleased with my purchase. I paid a hundred less than the MSRP for some unknown reason. Since it's the most expensive thing in my house I also purchased a ""drops and spills"" protection plan which I would recommend. I recommend this laptop to anyone looking for something that's sturdy powerful and pretty. It's all of those things. There are two reasons I gave it four stars instead of five: The graphics card is pretty weak for gaming and there is no possibility of upgrading anything inside. If you're ok with both of those things this is a stellar laptop.",0
Laptops,B01CQRNBJG,ASUS ZenBook Pro UX501VW 15.6-Inch…,        28 of 31 people found the following review helpful       Fake pentile 4K display. Not real 4K. Do not buy and expect 4K.  December 4  2016By Sn,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,As far as portable 15.6-inchers go this one's not bad. However you are being deceived.This laptop advertises a screen resolution of 4K UHD 3840x2160 but that isn't a complete truth. It's using what's called the RG/BW Pentile matrix a cheap trick to achieve the ability to advertise as 3840x2160 without actually achieving the full detail of the resolution itself. You can do a web search on this type of display to learn all you'd like but without getting too technical here it basically means even though the screen makes your computer render this resolution you don't get to see all that detail on your screen because it's missing half of its pixels.Lots of reviews talk about how nice the display is. The reason for that is because many people buying new laptops today will have had old laptops with the old standard 1366x768 TN displays. This is a huge upgrade from those but so are all the normal 1080p IPS displays you can get in other laptops half this price. Real 4K UHD 3840x2160 resolution is a huge upgrade from THIS display and it is a disrespect to laptops that do truly achieve the resolution that this one gets to advertise right along side them. It's not close to the tier of real-4K displays and not even as good as the 3K 2880x1620 displays available in some laptops such as the older ASUS UX51vz.In my opinion you should not buy this laptop. The Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo Y700 UHD both offer the same GPU but have a real 3840x2160 display. The ASUS may have more RAM or a bigger SSD but those should be low priority in your decision process because they can be easily installed after-market whereas you're pretty much stuck with this display. The Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo Y700 UHD are truly worthy choices whereas the ASUS UX501 thrives on deception. Don't buy it.I have attached two images to this review. One is a closeup of the Dell XPS 15's display and one is a closeup of a false-4K display such as the one in this laptop. Notice how only every other pixel can contribute to each primary color.,1
Laptops,B01CQRNBJG,ASUS ZenBook Pro UX501VW 15.6-Inch…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Not perfect  but you won't be disappointed  February 14  2017By Chris,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I'll comment a bit on look and feel stuff as well as how it operates since I think that's important when choosing a computer.Build-wise it seems very nice. The body of the computer is indeed made of aluminum which I like. It has nice chamfered edges on the inside (likely unnoticeable in the product shots but it's a nice detail) that I like. You won't open the lid with one finger but on the bright side the hinge has little wobble and seems nice and sturdy. It only opens up to about 130-degrees though if not less which doesn't seem all that far to me. Interestingly the body from the inside seems to have more flex than you'd expect for metal. It could be very nice coated plastic but I'm not sure. It feels similar to the way a Macbook Pro does. (If it is flexible metal that may actually be a better thing for durability as any blunt force would likely be taken by the laptop body and not by the hardware) The stickers on the inside will probably look shoddy from your hand resting on them after a while and mine aren't perfectly lined up. Most questionably the Thunderbolt sticker next to the USB C port is comically crooked on mine. Couldn't that be printed on the case like all the other USB ports?The display has a pentile pixel layout but I think it gets away with it for being 4k. For the uninitiated pentile is when the subpixels are slightly offset which can create a jagged look to fine details. You'll notice it if you look very closely but at normal distances I don't see it. I think it would have been unacceptable if the display were any lower in resolution. The black level seems high when you're looking at an all-dark screen but the contrast is not bad at normal viewing distances. It does have that greenish tint in the yellows that others have mentioned. I read somewhere that there's a driver tweak that fixes it though I haven't tried it yet. Viewing angles are okay it gets darker when you start to get more and more sideways. The glossy screen does glare kind of a lot though on the bright side it seems to have some sort of coating to resist fingerprints. It's not impeccable but it does seem to smudge up less than my previous touch screen laptop. It hasn't given me any problematic display lag for games either. One really great thing about it is how it looks at low brightness. I traditionally use laptops at full brightness all the time though if you do choose to turn yours down it retains decent contrast into middle brightness (and gets worse from there.) I was surprised by that.The keyboard is really nice the keys are springy and have a nice amount of travel and tactile feedback. The power button is in a weird spot though I've hit it a few times when going for the 'page down' key. On the bright side it goes to sleep and comes back very quickly! The trackpad felt too grippy for the first few days but now it feels nice and smooth. Trackpads seem to routinely be the worst part of any PC laptop so I'll vouch that this one is not bad. The click takes a bit too much force if you ask me but it's very responsive to tap clicks. I do tend to accidentally do different swipe gestures though its sensitivity is very high and it'll notice if your other fingers touch it while it's in use.I don't consider laptop speakers especially important. On this they're not all that strong. I'm surprised B&O put their name on it. (And they're on the bottom those dots around the keyboard are just cosmetic)Performance-wise it seems great so far. There's an included Nvidia utility that lets you decide which apps should use which GPU. It's useful in case of scenarios like I had where Photoshop would only see the Intel graphics. I was dealing with slowdowns (Intel graphics are really slow) even just using the UI until I figured that out! I'm mostly a Nintendo gamer but I tested Portal 2 and was surprised by the results. Plugged in it played smoothly in 4k at 2x anti aliasing and with middle-ground texture filtering (everything else at max.) The nice thing about 4k is that you don't need anti-aliasing as much. I didn't expect that kind of graphics performance which was a nice surprise! The GPU got to 80c during that game which is pretty toasty but shouldn't be unreasonable for a laptop.The processor is a hyperthreaded quad core i7 and performs flawlessly like you'd expect. Unless you're encoding video or rendering graphics you'll almost never see it at full usage. I haven't done any major tests of the SSD but I'm sure it's quick. It's very instantaneous for even fairly demanding tasks. I bought this to replace a fried Samsung that had an older i7 and older radeon graphics and even that was plenty to fulfill most of what I did with it (browsing occasional Photoshop and video processing) so this will be a good performer for most users for a very long time.Battery life isn't stellar though I'm sure I could also be doing a better job choosing settings that wouldn't drain it so fast.The Wifi performance is great. There's an area of my house where my Wii U has wonky reception (router is all the way on the other side) 3DSs are quite spotty first gen iPad Mini can't see wifi at all and my old laptop would often connect and disconnect. My desktop (same room) uses a newer ASUS USB dongle for Wifi that needs to have its antenna extended down the hallway to see the router. This laptop not only retains a connection in this room no problem but gets between 15 and 30 Mbps (down and up) depending on how my ISP is feeling that day. Very nice.At the time of this review this laptop has just about every cutting edge feature you could find in a strong all-around performance laptop. Current-gen i7 the popular GTX-960m graphics chip effective cooling and reasonable battery life USB 3 USB C (and thunderbolt!) and a 4k display. To me it's a plus that it's not a chunky ugly gaming laptop. It also has a nice keyboard and perhaps most crucially a trackpad you won't hate. The SSD is fast and has a lot of storage and 16gb of RAM is great. The reason it's so commendable despite its flaws is because any similar machine I looked at with these specs was around $500 more. For that cost I'm sure you'd get non-pentile 4k and perfectly aligned stickers. If those things aren't worth $500 to you this one is great. It also thoughtfully included a USB to ethernet adapter which I thought was nice! It gets four stars because of its minor flaws. They could have at least shipped it with the yellows properly situated and the stickers lined up. But I'm enjoying it.,0

August 3  2016By Rahul K.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,You can not get a better value for price. Everything about this laptop is amazing.Following is a list of my personal PROs and CONs. These factors may or may not be important or relevant to everyonePROs:1. Super fast. Not just fast but super fast. Thanks to DDR4 RAM and NVMe M2 SSD this laptop will ruin every other laptop for you. Because everything else seems slow after you have this laptop.2. Looks really nice.3. Excellent battery life.4. Light weight.CONs:1. It has a glossy screen. However It is a wonderful 4k screen which works perfectly fine indoors and I also use a secondary monitor. It does not bother me so much. Only sometimes.2. Sound. The highest volume is average at the best. Okay for indoor use. Could have been louder.,0

January 10  2017By Taylor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I see that a lot of people are bashing this laptop for no reason so I'll set some things straight. The UHD screen is amazing as far as I can tell it is indeed a full 4k resolution (tested with 4k youtube videos vs my 1080p desktop monitor). Specs are pretty fantastic for the price - you'd have to spend $500-$1000 more to get the same specs with Dell or Mac. I've had absolutely no issues with fan noise nor are there any issues with the speakers buzzing at full volume. And honestly I can't believe people are actually complaining about the track-pad being off-center. Get real folks - it's not even noticeable. The touch screen is a nice feature although admittedly I don't really use it.My one complaint is the built-in speakers are disappointingly low even at max volume. I found that it was difficult to hear at times when watching full length movies from 5-6 feet away. This can easily be remedied by plugging into something like a 5.1 setup but it's still annoying.Overall a fantastic laptop for the price.,0
Laptops,B01CQRNBJG,ASUS ZenBook Pro UX501VW 15.6-Inch…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Excellent machine for its category  September 3  2016By mdorn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I've had this laptop for 4 months and it earns its five star rating. It comes with very little bloatware that once removed boots in seconds. The 960m is a little under powered for the 4K screen but in general video games look and play well (I'd have preferred the 970m which seems to be the lowest NVIDIA card that is well respected for 4K gaming). The touchscreen is responsive though I don't use it much. Screen brightness and color richness is what you'd expect from a 4K screen and the difference from a lower resolution monitor is immediately clear.I think I remember reading reviews complaining about the offset keyboard and the trackpad not being great but these issues have not bothered me. Personally I prefer an external mouse to a trackpad on most occasions. Though the keyboard is inset a little far in the device meaning that you're more likely to rest your hands/arms on the machine.The aluminum shell gives the same feel as a macbook and the performance is undoubtedly superior.All in all this is the best laptop I've owned and I'll definitely look at the Zenbook again when I need to upgrade from this machine.,0

Coming from a 17"" ASUS ROG I wanted a smaller lighter laptop with the same power and I have not been disappointed.  I had been very satisfied with my ASUS and felt that an newer model would meet all my needs.  The ZenBook is extremely well built and much slimmer and lighter than the old beast.  I am a freelance photographer and often have the need to process images on location and transmit to clients to meet publishing deadlines.  The ability to quickly cull edit and transmit photos was a key requirement and this laptop has not missed a beat so far.While making a decision on which laptop to purchase I considered a 15"" MacBook Pro.  However to get equivalent specs the Apple was very close to twice as expensive.  The 4K screen resolution is impressive and while I didn't need the touch screen I find it useful at times.  Overall I am very satisfied with my decision to purchase another ASUS product.",0

Roark,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,This was a great laptop.  When I first received the laptop I would have given it five stars.  With the SSD the machine is fast and very capable of multitasking.  The Zenbook has a good number of ports and is aesthetically pleasing.I was working some spreadsheets then the laptop fan sounded like it was ready for lift off.  Shortly thereafter I had the unfortunately smell of burning electronics.  Then it was over.  The machine was dead and I was unable to retrieve any of my data or programs.  I had owned the machine for about a month at this point using it daily.When I contacted Amazon support the agent took less than 30 seconds to authorize a return with refund.  I have since replaced the laptop with a different model Asus and have been quite happy with it.,0

December 16  2016By Fabrizio,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Cons:- No toggle light for num lock. It's weird that they didn't include that since caps lock and the power button have it.- Optimized for use with Windows 10 only. Only an issue if you really want Linux on it. Very annoying issues with fan control and overheating.- Glossy screen I don't really have an issue with it I'm sure some would. Will get fingerprints on it very easily but it's easy to clean with the microfiber cloth that's included.- ICEpower audio driver makes speakers very quiet even at max volume. I uninstalled them and only use the realtek drivers. Speakers are about twice as loud after doing that.- Power brick is large but sleekPros:- Very good price IMO. Found it for $1350.- Power cable is angled- Awesome screen. Not the best 4k display I've seen but definitely good enough for me. Touchscreen works well but I don't really care for it. Every now and then it comes in handy though.- Great CPU and GPU- Great touchpad. Feels good to use very smooth. Multigesture works great. I have big hands and don't have any issues with my palm getting in the way.- Full HDMI USB-C and 3x USB 3.0- Light enough that it isn't a burden heavy enough that it feels good to hold.- a e s t h e t i c,0

Inclusion of a number pad is useful ...  August 23  2016By jdelo012,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Notes: When I initially ordered this product I received a faulty product that had an unresponsive and physically damaged space bar and was missing a power cable. Thankfully Amazon's replacement process allowed me to receive a new one that remedied these issues.Pros:* Battery Life: My damaged model held a 7 hour average battery time over the week I had it. My new model holds 5-6 hours of battery. This is in power saver mode with 30 - 50 percent brightness using google chrome to do lots of browsing and youtube things. Respectable in my opinion.* Keyboard: With the exception of the damaged key the tactile feel of keyboard is pretty good. Inclusion of a number pad is useful for number crunchers like myself. Back light is uneven on some keys (notably tab) but it serves its purpose.* Touch Pad: Pretty good not perfect. It is for the most part accurate and responsive. Asus' gesture software is not completely customizable but covers most usage scenarios well and picks up those gestures. There is some micro shakiness every now and then and the touch to click may not seem to work but I think it's my finger posture that causes these misreads. Still something to watch out for but I think it's good.* Build: The metal build is sexy. Fingerprints do get on it but they are easy to clean and the laptop comes with a cleaning cloth. Some will this device is ""heavier"" than its competitors; however ""heavier"" is a relative term. 4.5 pounds is not heavy at all. Do you even lift?* Value: Other machines with the specs and performance of the UX501VW cost around $2200+. This costs $1500. There are some compromises but when it comes to price to performance this machine is the bee knees.Cons:* Screen: Although the 4K monitor is beautiful when software supports certain programs become unwieldy when 4K resolution is involved. My usage scenario of using a wacom tablet to write equations is notably difficult as the stylus UI does not scale with the high resolution and creates an extremely tiny reticle for the pen. The screen itself is also incredibly glossy and mirror-like. It's still extremely pretty if these things do not bother you. There is some wobble when poked but only noticeable when brought up. I'm sorry that you can't unthink that now when you poke your screen.* Speakers: Utterly disappointing. In both models I had the sound was quiet and uneven. Quiet in that a macbook air at half volume was louder than this machine at max output. Uneven in that the left speaker is consistently louder than the right speaker. What punctuates this disappoint is that I had experienced two models with these issues. I highly recommend external speakers or headphones when using this device.* SD Card slot: Your card will stick half-way out. Not a terrible thing on a desk-top but something I'd rather not think about on a mobile deviceConclusion: This product is a good and smart buy if you care more about price to performance. You do make compromises with sound and glossy screen but those are easily fixed with a matte screen protector and a good pair of headphones or speakers; both of which you could buy with the $600 you saved by buying this instead of a similarly speced XPS 15 or Thinkpad P50 (The other options I considered when buying the UX501VW).",0

February 20  2017By Teren S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Good design except for a key face (the number 6 for me) falling off when in the tablet mode.  In this mode the keyboard sits with the keyboard down and can catch on your clothing a blanket or whatever.  I took the unit to Best Buy but they said that they could not simply get me a new snap-on key.  Rather the entire unit needed to be returned to Lenovo to replace the full keyboard section: Stupid in my opinion!  I think I solved the problem by buying a plastic sleeve (essentially just a plastic envelope) that I now place over the keyboard before flipping the unit to tablet position.  Of course I had to cut a hole in the plastic sleeve where the fan vent is  It now works great and if a key were to fall off it is in the plastic envelope.  It would have been nice if the brilliant computer engineers that design for Lenovo would just think through what could go wrong in various positions then design the unit to address the potential shortfalls.  Maybe a mechanical engineer instead of only computer smart people.  Also I have used Windows 7 for many years and loved it;  it is taking some time to adjust to Windows 10.,0

For the price this is best 2 in 1 out there.  I think the poor keyboard and high price of the Surface Pro make this a superior option.  The shift key is a legitimate concern.  I gave it 2 days to get used to and could not take it any longer so I went the keytweak program and remapped the keys then physically swapped them and problem solved.Very pleased with this purchase.",0

December 3  2016By Catrgt,4.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,i had to buy a used one because the new models on amazon.com don't ship to Canada (i managed to find a seller that would ship it to Canada but it was used).. still love it though and glad i bought it... i find that this hp chromebook is slightly faster and snappier than my HP Chromebook 14-ak050nr model... and it can handle more open tabs as well!! which i really like!! (im a heavy youtube watcher- i will have 10 or more youtube tabs open at once for days on end and this model handles it better than my ak050nr model- which struggles with 6 youtube tabs)... (not only can i have 15 tabs of youtube open but i can also browse  other sites at the same time like facebook dailymail yahoo weathernetwork news articles etc. without any issues.. which my other model can't handle without lagging and crashing)i like how the keyboard is black rather than white- and i like how the outside of the laptop is black rather than grey or white like some of the other models (makes it look more sleek and professional)... keyboard and speakers are still the same like every other model (pretty good if you ask me)... i wish i could have bought this laptop brand new but they don't sell it in Canada and Amazon US doesn't ship the new ones to Canada so i was forced to buy a used one- although i saved over 100 bucks buy buying the used one.i can't really comment on the battery life because as i said this is used and i don't know the history of this laptop. but the battery life is shorter than my other HP 14 (i only get 4 hours at the most while my other one gets almost double that),0

February 3  2017By Ryan LoewinsohnVerified Purchase(What's this?),5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was a bit skeptical since this chromebook operates with its own OS which I didn't fully comprehend the gravity of till I tried to download or add on some laptop necessities like Microsoft Office etc. There are a lot of users that have recommended applications free of charge but for the cost graphics weight and most importantly speed... this chromebook exceeds my expectations. Well worth the cost. The battery lasts me about 12 hours unplugged. I typically run 6-8 tabs online and am constantly streaming music from YouTube since it's only downside (as many others agree) it doesn't have a sufficient/capable MP3 player/music playing ability -yet. But I'm typically optimistic. (Still worth the cost).,0

It's quick and I'm able to have programs such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop along with others open at the same time without it causing any problems.

I took my time to find a perfect product and this laptop met all my expectations. I was a bit concerned because some people mentioned that it's slow. My advice is to ignore these comments. Unless you want to use it for the most advanced games I can guarantee that you will not have such issues. It's fast and reliable. It doesn't freeze and I didn't have any problems with Windows updates. It's quiet and pretty light but definitely does not feel cheap.The keyboard is soft and nice. I tend to work on several apps at the same time and watch movies online and the streaming is perfect. The battery life is impressive. I like plugging it into TV with the HDMI cable (not included) and can watch a couple movies while it's unplugged.The condition is perfect and I would never guess that it's beem refurbished. It comes with Windows so you don't have to pay for it separately.You can also get a trial version of MS Office for free but you'd need to pay for subscription after the first month.I highly recommend it!,0

I am already experiencing ""graphics"" issues where I get flickering pixelation and discoloration.

I purchased this to replace my six year old MacBook Pro and really like the style as well as how light it is compared to my last laptop. Also the screen puts my older MacBook Pro to shame. Sadly this is where the love for this product ends. I received my laptop yesterday and sadly there was a problem with the keyboard. The ""I"" key worked as if it had a mind of its own. Sometimes it would work but most of the time I found that I had to press it multiple times to get it to respond. So today I contacted Amazon customer support and tried to get some help since last night I did some reading in the forums and discovered that this is a known issue with some of these laptops and it is a hardware issue and not software. Unfortunately the customer support agent could not understand this but instead wanted me to restore the keyboard defaults that by the way had not been changed. Then she wanted me to spray compressed air on the brand new keyboard. Then finally uninstall and reinstall the keyboard drivers that have nothing to do with one key not working. After multiple attempts to explain this I finally gave up and decided to return the laptop and go to the Apple store and purchase one locally so in the event that I have further issues I can go stand face to face with an Apple customer support agent and have my problem resolved locally. Let me express that by no means where the support agents rude in fact they were quite pleasant however they failed to listen to what I was telling them and appeared to be reading off of a cue card. Again I realize that electronics can and will have issues. I have been in the electronics industry for over 30 years and have seen my fair share of problems but for the first time since becoming an Amazon Prime member I felt that Amazon customer support fell short of my expectations especially considering the cost of this product and the fact that it had issues straight out of the box. Hopefully this will be a learning experience for their customer support staff so in the future they will more willing to listen to the customer and not offer a canned response that offers no resolutions.",0

Laptops,B01LTHXA5O,Apple MacBook Pro MLH12LL/A…,        44 of 51 people found the following review helpful       Small Things Add Up To Great - Don't Wait!  December 22  2016By William,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Long time Apple products user this laptop is so much better than I expected.  A few points that might be useful for your consideration:I actually delayed purchase because in the store those super thin super light MacBooks make the Pro feel heavy.  But then I realized the pro was just a very little heavier from the top of the line Air I am retiring.  For a small amount of weight I get tremendously more power.The USB-C ports? Better than expected - they plug in without any ""up""'or ""downside"" and you can plug power into any port on either side.  I travel a lot so plugging in in either side helps in those hotels more than I expected. Yes I have to have some adapters--but I needed those for example for an HDMI or VGA projector connection anyway.The keyboard is magical and it is hard to explain why. The keys are responsive for sure but they are set into the casing so low and the surface of the keys are slick enough that your fingers can slide across the keys in a strangely fluid way of typing.The touch bar? Was sure this was sort of a gimmic--not at all! Turns out it is a fantastic way to control so many different aspects of the computer. It is nothing less than a star-trek like instrument panel that changes based on the context of what you are doing.  Being able to make purchases or unlock authorization requests with a quick fingerprint is surprisingly quick easy and truly useful.Memory? After doing a lot of research online I discovered that given the speed of solid state drives swap files are not all that different on SSDs than how larger amounts of working memory are used to avoid using swap files. While there are admittedly differences between the memory in SSDs and the chips on the CPU board researchers are showing that more memory beyond even just 8 Gigs (what I purchased) offers little gain.  So I spent the dollars on a larger SSD (512) than more working memory.I also researched the i5 vs i7 chip options but stayed with the i5 once I discovered that both support only 4 cores in these machines. (You need a desktop version of the i7 to get the 8 core power -- or the 15"" Laptop)And yes the screen is gorgeous and the colors are richer; for a work machine this is not the most important thing for me--except for how sharp text appears on the screen. My eyes do appreciate the clarity very much.I do a lot of business related writing powerpoints endless amounts of email and I also fire up Lightroom and Photoshop and other more demanding apps - wonderfully responsive with all of these.  Again it's the fast SSD that is making most of the real world difference I believe.And that super large track pad basically means that you never have to reach to or adjust to where the track pad is; rather it is always just there--wherever your hands are on the keypad.And the sound!! Truly amazing speakers!Another small thing that turns out to matter--having a machine that turns on as you lift the lid (and in my case authorizes access with my Apple Watch) makes for an amazingly seemless experience--it feels as if it is anticipating what you want to be doing...So now I am only frustrated because I waited to purchase. Many of the old specs seem to matter so much less now.  In the real world this is a package that just hums along quick powerful so well thought out that it almost makes work fun again.Good luck with your own purchase decisions!!",0

Laptops,B01LTHXA5O,Apple MacBook Pro MLH12LL/A…,        12 of 14 people found the following review helpful       Macbook Pro 2016 is a total crap - be careful before investing in this new model  February 4  2017By Amaz0529,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I am deeply disappointed with the crap they have put together with this new Macbook Pro 2016. Whatever new bells and whistles they have in this new machine such as USB-C have just added to the cost but have made it really difficult to connect to my existing hardware. There are not that many cable connectors/adapters to connect to USB-3/2 or so many other types of connectors that are out there including hdmi. The few that are available cost an arm and a leg.The ones that I could connect to (for example external monitors) such as DVI to USB-C (through adapters) don't work. The monitor displays images that keep flashing. I have tried many configurations and they all have the same result.The worst problem is in printing. When I try to print to a PDF file or a Printer the screen quickly scrolls horizontally stops all other apps that are running and then comes back to the print page and thenI have to try all over again. This happens consistently for every second or third time I print. I called Apple support and the guy was nice and tried to help me. First he thought it is something to do with the OS and made me reinstall it. He tried all he could but the same result. Then he told me it could be a hardware issue and take it to a retail store and get it checked out. I was not going to shell out 2K and within the first week experience these kinds of problems and start going to technicians from the start. I was thankfully able to return it.Then I thought it was bad luck and then went on to buy the same model and hoped that these problems would not be there. Alas same result. My external monitors exhibited the same problem and the printing issue had same problems with the same consistency.Apple has gotten arrogant and complacent. I guess if Steve Jobs were alive today there would be some heads rolling by now or may be this kind of product would never have made it to the market.I have been a Windows user for the last 2 decades but I got disillusioned with the Windows 10 and decided to switch. I am pretty disheartened that there is no alternative. It is hard to get new old model of Macbooks.People think before upgrading to this crap. I have all the documentation to prove this and if you need more details pl write back for more details.I have to be more specific about printing. I am not sure why there are not many more complaints about this from others. Anyways when I say print I mean printing from a website. I tend to read a lot of articles and save many of them if I want to read them in the future. So far I have encountered this problem only when i print from a website. I am not sure if this is the case when you go to a document and print to your hardware printer. I don't print a lot to papers just to save the environment and try to read as much on screens as possible.I request other users of this latest machine to try and see if they are facing the same issues. May be most people don't print from articles on sites. That could be one reason why people are not complaining about it in bigger numbers. However those that experience the same issues should put that in their review so that Apple takes this seriously and fix the bug ASAP.thanks.,0
Laptops,B01LTHXA5O,Apple MacBook Pro MLH12LL/A…, Thumbs down  Apple  November 19  2016By DVerified Purchase(What's this?),2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,UPDATED FEBRUARY 2017Let me start with the good:  love the small footprint and weight of this laptop.  It feels more like carrying a tablet than a computer.  But for what is supposed to be a professional computer those are not essentials and come at the expense of much more important features.- After months of use I still hate the keyboard and find it to be about the worst I’ve ever used.  Just can’t stand the shallowness of the keys which makes it way too easy to miss a keystroke or hit the wrong key.  I’m a good typist; this is not “user error”.  I just can’t adjust to this style and would gladly add a few millimeters back to the thickness of the computer if it meant having a normal keyboard again.- Is the world ready for a laptop with no traditional USB ports?  Apparently not:  after all these months there is still no USB-C mouse on the market that I can find.  I’m a mouse guy and can’t work all day on trackpad alone so I’m stuck using a dongle to plug in my wireless mouse receiver.  It's crazy to completely drop a port before the industry is even close to switching over to something new.  (Want to restore my faith in you Apple?  Build a technology for wireless peripheral communication that works better than bluetooth.)- Touch Bar is beyond useless and actually slows me down.  What a strange and unnecessary addition.  Isn’t Apple already marketing the iPad Pro to people who focus on touch input?  I say keep laptops and tablets separate until you’re truly ready to merge those worlds some day.- Losing MagSafe charging is a shame.  And connecting and disconnecting cables to the USB-C ports requires nimble fingers because they are so small and close to each other.I strongly prefer macOS over Windows 10 but this collection of very poor design choices is pushing me close to switching to a PC.  If Windows improves a little over the next year and Apple doesn’t realize their error and build a real Pro machine this will definitely be my last MacBook.  This computer is fine for taking to bed to watch a movie or browse the internet but to do real work on all day it's a major disappointment.  And that’s a shame because the MacBook Pro was once the very best laptop on the market by far.,0

The space gray color in my opinion looks more attractive and appealing. I own the 2012 MacBook pro with retina and in terms of color the space gray one takes the trophy.2.) The retina display is a lot brighter and sharp.3.) Very fast when using final cut pro or Photoshop.4.) You can’t even notice there is a fan on this laptop. On my 2012 MacBook Pro I constantly hear the fan when rendering in final cut pro but not on this one!5.) Lighter and smaller than the previous generation. Although not by much you can feel the difference.6.) The trackpad is as Donald Trump would say “Huge!” When I went back to work on my 2012 MacBook pro I missed having the humongous trackpad in front of me. It is a nice to have the extra space to scroll and click.Cons1.) Touch ID is limited: When you turn on the computer for the first time you need to input your password you are not allowed to use your finger to login. I have yet to see a program that takes advantage of the touch id. You cannot even use touch ID at the apple store on the mac you must input your password manually.2.) The 15” – 512gb is expensive! I couldn’t believe apple would sell a $2400 computer with 256gb in 2016! I honestly recommend you get at least 512gb of memory. With all the new programs coming out music and video your hard drive will get full fast. Not to mention that if you plan to install windows 10 (only windows version that you can install) with boot camp you will need the additional hard drive space…3.) You must buy dongles for almost any device you own (to charge your phone your current external hard drives printer etc.).4.) No more illuminated logo on the back of the screen. Not a big thing to me but I know some people loved that.Overall: If you already own a 2012 MacBook Pro or newer it will probably be a waste of money to upgrade to this one. Unless you are an apple fanboy like me and just need to have the newest apple product. Otherwise stay with your MacBook Pro which can probably do 90% of the same things this one can. If it is your first time buying a mac and you will be working on photo or video editing software this is the computer for you! For casual web browsing and school work go with a much cheaper 13” MacBook pro or the 12” MacBook. The touch bar is a nice feature but it does not add much to the user experience (I wish they would have given me more Gigabyte’s instead).,1

I had two HP Pavilions before switching to this Macbook Pro and I can honestly say I wouldn't go back. The HP's were both i7's and should have performed like such. Instead I got slow machines with low quality hardware. After constant driver issues and windows updates during the most inconvenient times I decided to make the jump and switch. The Macbook Pro is sleek and outperforms my previous Windows i7's dramatically while only having an i5. The software isn't that hard to get used to and it really is a treat to use. Everything opens instantly and shows no signs of slowing down. The controversy about the ports is blown way out of proportion too. One dongle and I can do everything I need on this amazing display. 4 stars because the price is hard to justify but I am really happy I bought this instead of a surface. The quality is amazing and something I am not used to.,0

I got a decent deal on this due to the lightning sale. I bought a few upgrades like the Kingston 16gb DDR4 RAM and Samsung Evo 850 500 GB SSD. After installation this thing is running like a champ. I had a few issues though with the upgrades. The most problematic was migrating the Windows 10 OS to the SSD. The Samsung migration software did not work for me and I spent countless hours trying to fix it. I was getting a continuous loop boot on start up and thought that I had bricked my brand new laptop. Long story short I had to restore it and use a 3rd party migration software from Paragon to put the OS into the SSD. Now its super fast on start up and works flawlessly.Update 12/15/16: Still works great. Using my Xbox one controller to play games. Im sold and converted to pc gaming. No more consoles for me as I'm researching into building a desktop gaming rig. I'll still use this laptop for school and gaming.,1

September 16  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,Good things!Awesome performance when playing video games such as Deus Ex Black Ops 3 etc on HIGH settings. I did change the hard drive to a SSD and put in some more memory which was icing on the cake really. The keyboard is also pretty amazing and feels great when typing. The speakers are much better than other laptop speakers sounds so good vs the minimalist speakers that other companies put in their laptops.Some things that could change in the next model!The material that they put on the inside of the laptop where the keyboard and mouse pad are is really horrible for keeping clean. It constantly obtains marks from your wrists laying there and from being touched in general. However I wouldn't not buy this because of that.,0

I love the build quality the keyboard. I don't have much feedback on the touch pad since I do use a mouse regularly. This laptop is certainly on the heavier side but I like its professional yet gamer profile. The JBL speakers are great nothing to write home about.I'd certainly advise throwing an SSD into this as the built in HDD is awfully slow. For the price you can go ahead and build a much nicer desktop however for portable business users that want casual gaming experience this is perfect.,0

It *is* heavy but powerful. It drains the battery in a day or two even if the lid is closed.I bought this on Amazon with the 1Tbyte *very* slow hard-drive but I also purchased a 256Gbyte SSD independently. This saves around $200 compared to buying this very configuration from Lenovo. It took a screwdriver and about 5 minutes to put in the SSD and another 30 minutes to transfer Windows10 from the hard-drive to the SSD.,0

No NVMe and it's very fast.Next the size of the device. it's alot larger than the photos would lead you to believe. it's height is about one inch which is fine but a little wide. as a matter of fact when I took the laptop out of the box for the first time I thought it was a 17"" model. nope 15""6. Not bad tho if you take into consideration the performance... which leads to the next topic...this laptop is very Powerful. it's crushes my 3 year old gtx 780ti. its maxing out my entire steam library with ease... just make sure you keep it plugged in or else performance will drop significantly.as far as build quality its better than decent imo. plastic but a solid design.I do have some complaints tho...1. the touchpad is slightly less than decent imo. Once you get oil on it finger glide is noticeablly different. The click also is missing a certain crispness that I felt from other laptops. It's not a deal breaker by anymeans but I would recommend a mouse.2. speakers are meh not horrible by any means but no bass. I would recommend headphones.3. the FN KEY is very annoying. if you want to use the numpad screen brightness speakers and more you need to use the FN key. Maybe there are setting to bypass this but as far as I know it's just a hassle to use.The laptop runs fairly loud and hot when under full load during stress tests. as far as heat goes temp ussally stay between 80-90c for both the GPU and CPU. The CPU tends to be hotter occasionally dipping into the low 90s.(I tested in a 72f room.) as far as regular gaming in GTA 5 the temps and fan were much lower and quieter During gameplay. The fans do a great job of keeping the keyboard cool and heat is dispersed properly from the rear vents.The laptop is a bit larger than first thought but if you take into consideration the type of power this laptop has within it's chassis its extremely portable.This laptop is for the gamer on the go. coming from an i7-4770k/gtx 780ti full gaming rig I'm more than satisfied with this product. The laptop's i7-6700HQ/gtx 1070 w/16gbs of ram DDR4 really ensure that the system is future proof and will easily do 1080p/60hz on high for at least 2-3 years.asus GL502VS has the ability to crush any game and anywhere.",1
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,"        140 of 154 people found the following review helpful       A ""Gaming"" Laptop that justifies the price  August 21  2016By Marcus Salinas",5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"I have been a long idealist of having a desktop over buying a ""gaming"" laptop because the price. I have been wanting to upgrade my dekstop PC for 3 years now and I was finally able to since I had most of the parts needed and would just need a new moboRAM CPUGPU and case.  So adding it all together I could have gotten essentially what this laptop game me for about $1000.Then I started thinking about it what this laptop offers you as a consumer. 16GB RAM which means never having to worry about multitasking or chrome eating up too much memory. I develop on my desktop and I would have a hard time running Android Studio (my desktop was running an Intel Core Duo 2 Q9550) and anything else at the same time. I had to close out of unnecessary things like Chrome and Steam when I developed. An i7. It may be a mobile i7 but it still is an amazing piece of technology. Everything opens quickly which I was used to be I have never seen anything stutter or lag. It's incredible.Then there is the coup de gras: the 1070. Oh my goodness. I don't know if you know this but Nvidia promised to the mobile 10xx series to be at most 10% difference between  the desktop versions. I believe it. I have no issues ever. Every game max settings 1080p. I don't really pay attention to frame rates but I'm sure it's through the roof. It's always smooth. There is not one game on 1080p that I could find that didn't give me smooth game play. Even ARK on epic did not have trouble. The 1070 is VR capable and I wish I could test it out because I am sure it will be able to run it.Battery life could be an issue. It's hard to say. The battery estimator is completely garbage. Depending on what you're doing it will say you have 3 hours and then you open up chrome or something and it jumps down to 1 hour. Silly thing. I keep it plugged in at my desktop for the majority of the time I've had it but the one time I took it with me to work outside my house I was able to browse the web and program in Android Studio for about an hour and 45 minutes and I was at 50% battery so take that for what you will. I also had power saver turned on basically as soon as it off the charger which didn't result in any known performance issues. I don't know how they expect you to get 5 hours but oh well. The charger is kind of bulky too but that is to be expected. Also if you want to buy a case for it don't get the 15-15.6"" cases get the 17"" ones because I got one of them and my laptop barley fits. Like just barley. I have to unplug everything from the USB ports and it's a very tight fit but it works.As I thought about the hardware that comes with it I realized that this is actually a pretty good value for you get. I looked at other ""gaming"" laptops and I couldn't believe the prices they go for. Some don't have SSDs or only a 960m and are in the same price zone as this laptop. You can get everything this laptop offers starting from nothing for about $300-$400 less in a desktop and if all you care about is that then I encourage you to do that. But if you are on the move or work on the move and like to game then I recommend this laptop highly recommend. For me it came down to ""Is it worth $400 more for mobility?"" and that answer is yes and I am very pleased with what I got.PROs:* Never have to worry about performance in multitasking/1080p gaming. To me this is a future proof device. As for how long I can't say because technology is growing quickly but my last desktop lasted me 7 years so I expect at least 5 on this one. Hopefully the exterior can hold up for that long. I guess if you are a serious gamer and you want 144Hz 60FPS you will be disappointed but if you want smooth gameplay on the highest settings at 1080p for any game this will do you fine.* Perfect amount of ports. You get 3 USB 3.0 ports 1 USB C port ethernet mini DisplayPort headphone/mic jack SD card reader and an HDMI out. I'm pretty sure it's 2.0 but I cannot verify that. It would just be silly if it wasn't. I would recommend buying a USB 3.0 hub for another $12 so you can just unplug the one port if you want to use this on the go.Neutral* Finger print magnet on the top and the trackpad. Just finger prints everywhere. The keyboard is a full keyboard. You get a dedicated numpad and function buttons at the top that can control audio and open things. It feels good to type with. The spacing is perfect and it doesn't have a small backspace or any other useful key. It feel durable and should last a while. The overall build is good. There is plastic so it's not the best but it works.* I personally don't like it only as one m.2 drive. I have seen on similar laptops from ASUS that have two and am not sure why they couldn't include it in this one. That being said it is pretty straight forward to replace the drives. You just open the bottom panel by removing the screws and then remove and replace the drives you want.* Battery life is meh. Don't expect to play games on this without your charger or being plugged in. I haven't tested it but I cannot imagine it will last very long with the one test I did do just using it for work. If you need to take it on the go for a few hours then it will be okay.CONs* The only con I have about this laptop is that it comes with so much crap. Unnecessary crap. Highly recommend doing a fresh install of Windows 10.Really good laptop if you want a ""gaming"" laptop or just a powerhouse of a laptop. If you need to be mobile for work or whatever so you can take it on the go I highly recommend. If you just use your computer as a battle station or work station from home then I recommend building your own PC because it is cheaper and for $1700 you could have a build with a 1080 and i7 that is more powerful than this one.",0
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        11 of 11 people found the following review helpful       Kaby Lake  GTX 1060 6GB  128GB M.2 SSD  1TB 5400RPM HDD  G-SYNC  January 28  2017By Bryan Garner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"The first thing I'm going to do given the confusion as to tech specs is to discuss what this laptop does indeed come equipped with.  This laptop comes equipped with 7th generation Intel Core i7 7700HQ CPU (Kaby Lake) 16GB DDR4-2400 RAM GTX 1060 6GB (Pascal) 128GB M.2 SSD (mine came with SanDisk) 1TB 5400RPM HDD (mine came with Hitachi) and most importantly...a 15.6"" 1920x1080 60Hz IPS G-Sync enabled display.  I repeat...a 15.6"" 1920x1080 60Hz IPS G-Sync enabled display.  This website...http://edgeup.asus.com/2017/01/04/kaby-rog-gaming-laptop-guide/...clearly lays out the specs and differences between the various models.  I would strongly advise reading it if you are uncertain about any specs with this series of laptops.  Now...on to the review.Design/Layout...4.0/5.0:  I took a point off here because while the laptop is very attractively presented (in my opinion) the ""thin and light"" nature of it's design and the inclusion of the GTX 1060 does inevitably mean that there will be a moderate amount of heat.  I am a causal gamer (Diablo 3 League of Legends Final Fantasy XIV etc) so the games I play don't really put too much of a strain on the graphics.  That being said with the mentioned games begin maxed out graphically speaking the laptop did get rather warm though not enough to concern me even after an hour of playing.  I personally feel like if the vents on the bottom of the laptop were positioned better or wider vented heat wouldn't be as much of an issue.  The laptop itself is very sleek and features a minimalist aesthetic which I am very fond of.  The lid is brushed aluminum while the deck is high-quality plastic painted to match.  The chicklet keyboard has stylish ROG-red LEDs under the keys to provide a nice but not obnoxious glow.  Other than that all the ports are conveniently laid out and the build quality over all is excellent.Setup...4.5/5.0:  Half a point was lost here due more to confusion on ASUS' website than with the the laptop itself.  The first thing I like to do when I get a new laptop is to take an inventory of drivers and useful software download said drivers and software from the manufacturer's website and do a complete from-scratch reload of the OS.  On ASUS' website if you search for ""GL502VM"" you will see ""GL502VM (7th generation Kaby Lake)"" and ""GL502VM"" auto-populate.  If you choose the former (which is what this laptop is) you will be taken to what is effectively a blank page. No driver download options no manuals FAQs...nothing.  If you choose the latter (which is the Skylake model) you will have all the download options you need.  This actually prompted a call to ASUS Customer Service so they could verify that the Skylake model drivers would indeed work with the Kaby Lake model.  Once that confusion was gone...I had all my drivers and software in hand.  After that the OS reload was a breeze and the laptop has been working like champ ever since.Performance...5.0/5.0:  I have absolutely nothing to complain about here.  This thing travels at warp speed!  Windows installed from start to finish in about 15 minutes takes about 4 seconds to load to a workable desktop and about 3-4 seconds to shut completely down.  As for gaming I mentioned the games that I play above and I knew before testing that I would be able to run all of them maxed out.  No surprises here thanks to good research.Reliability...4.0/5.0:  A point was lost here because of the ASUS Precision Touchpad.  When it works. it works as well as a touchpad can maybe a little better thanks to the multi-touch capability.  However after a time the right-click function on the touchpad just stops working.  The timing is random no errors are indicated and the only way to restore full functionality is to disable/enable the device via Device Manager.  I have verified that the latest driver is installed so it is more than likely a small glitch with the driver and Windows.  I am hoping that future driver update fixes this issue but for now it is not a huge deal being that I have a USB wireless mouse.All in all I would highly recommend this laptop for anyone who is a casual to mid-range gamer graphic designer video editor or student. This is very well build laptop that will likely last 3-5 years before falling victim to obselence.  Hardcore gamers...I would advise you look at a model with the GTX 1070 and 120Hz display unless you are on a tight budget.  I just feel like this product could not withstand hours of heat due to the intense graphic demand of AAA FPS games and over time you would most certainly experience a drop-off in frame rates.Overall rating: 4.375",0
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       180W AC Adapter included when you need 230W  January 29  2017By Frankie F.,2.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"Let me start by saying I've been an Asus fanboy for quite a few years starting with custom builds with Asus mobos and then getting into their ROG laptops starting with the G73 then the G750jm. I figured I'd try my luck with their new ROG GL502 as I wanted something a bit more portable and powerful with the new ""desktop class performance"" of the gtx 10 series.This thing would be a home run had it shipped with a proper AC adapter. It has a super fast NVMe m.2 samsung drive and extra storage with a decent 7200rpm HDD. G-sync panel and a gtx1070 graphics card all in a light form factor!I really wanted to like this laptop but it has one glaring problem if you are a heavy gamer... Pretty much all other gtx1070 laptops come with a 230W adapter but this one ships with a 180W which doesn't provide enough juice during heavy gaming sessions causing the NON-REMOVABLE battery to drain while it's plugged in! Once it hits about 90% battery it starts to charge again causing the graphics card to hit the power limit and starts to throttle clock speeds. Frame rates drop by almost HALF! Started researching and found I am not alone with this issue. Asus released a bios update but this only caused the gtx 1070 to not hit as high of boost clocks but I still received battery draw while plugged into the wall. My biggest concern is the amount of wear and tear from the battery dropping to 90% and then charging back up to 100% multiple times during gaming sessions multiplied by a year or two. The battery is certainly going to die prematurely and you can't even remove it without taking the bottom cover off removing screws holding it in place and disconnecting the battery from a motherboard header. I paid a lot of money for this thing and I am not willing to deal with these headaches!I replaced this with a new MSi gt72vr dominator pro with kaby lake and haven't looked back. I know I lost a bit on portability but I am getting much better FPS in every title and the 120Hz G-sync panel destorys the Asus!! And the biggest pro is NO MORE BATTERY DRAW WHILE PLUGGED INTO THE WALL!",0
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       A great laptop  but with things to consider.  January 11  2017By Chance,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was a little hesitant with buying this as there had seemed to be a large amount of people starting to give this laptop low scores but honestly this was a pretty great buy. I've used this laptop for a week and feel like I know enough to write a review about it.Looks:The aesthetic of course is aiming towards gamers so a lot of red lights and black accents are here. Luckily you can turn the keyboard lights off but the front light does not turn off. So if you are looking for a gaming laptop that you can use professionally you may want to look towards other laptops if you care about how it looks.Build:The build is a mixture of metal and plastic but overall feels very sturdy. The bottom of the keyboard area has very little give so typing feels nice and doesn't feel cheap. I don't feel like I need to be overly gentle with it when I am traveling to class. With it being relatively thin for a gaming laptop it's nice to have it be fairly sturdy.Keyboard:The keyboard has a red backlight and can have the brightness adjusted. I'm not an expert on keyboards but it feels pretty nice they have a nice travel distance and feels alright to type on. They sort of shoved a number pad onto the right which makes the overall setup a little squished. Also when removing bloatware do not remove the ATK Package as you will lose control of the keyboard.Trackpad:I have been seeing a lot of people trashing on the trackpad maybe it's because I'm not an expert but it honestly feels alright.Ports:The only gripe I have is that the laptop only comes with 3 USB ports despite them getting rid of the disk drive. With my Cloud Pro and mouse I only have one USB left I would have liked if they added just a few more even if they were 2.0. But it does come with USB C with Thunderbolt and HDMI and Mini-Displayport and an SD card reader which is nice.Display:Honestly this is the main selling point for this laptop as no other laptop in this price range has a G-Sync monitor. Mixed with the IPS tech gaming on it is incredibly great. Accurate colors no input lag it's all you could wish for. It does have one drawback though which i will address in another part.Performance:With the GTX 1060 you can pretty much play any game you want on ultra settings. The performance of this machine is on the level of desktops and its fantastic. The extra RAM also helps with multi-tasking and what-not. I did not get the one with the SSD as it will be cheaper to add one later but it's nice to find a laptop with a 7200rpm HDD which is still just fine.Temps:Honestly it varies some games both the CPU and GPU stay within the mid and high 70s in others like Battlefield 1 the CPU seems to constantly hover around the high 90s and even reaching 100 *C and the GPU in the mid 80s. They could be better but for being fairly small and lightweight it was what I was expecting. I played BF1 for a few hours with the CPU around 98 *C and the performance didn't tank nor did the laptop shut off. Also despite the area above the keyboard being very hot the general keyboard area stays very cool.Battery:I gotta say I wasn't expecting much in terms of battery life in a gaming laptop but even this was kinda disappointing. I can only ever get around 2 hours of battery life. Yes I know there is a GTX 1060 so of course there is a lot of power needed. It also doesn't help that with the G-Sync panel the laptop can't switch to the Intel graphics to save battery. So if you have a long lab for college make sure to bring your cable.Even with the battery and temp shortcomings I still really like this laptop its fast its light and is packed with features.,0

Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        5 of 5 people found the following review helpful       Hands down the best device I have ever used.  December 11  2016By Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"This laptop is a real Beast. I moved from a dying Inspiron n5110 to this it was quite an upgrade.I have always had a good experience with Asus so I thought I'd invest in this laptopas far a build materials I like it and I don't know why others thinks that it is cheap plastic but bear in mind that this is the first quality laptop I ever bought so I can't really compare it to other brands or models.Pros:1- GTX 1070. the GPU can take any game thrown at it easily.I played: Arkham KnightWitcher 3Battlefield 4 and more. all maxed out without a single stutterbe also informed that I render some games at 4K and then downscale through nvidia supersampling.2- blazing fast SSDI have over 50 programs installed and still it boots up like the day it has arrived. I have Android studio SQL serverVisual Studio Adobe PS illustrator ...etc and many heavy programs installedthese are the things that are SUPER and not just good.cons:1- 60hz monitor. the GPU capabilities is way beyond running ANY game maxed out on 60hz on 1080p it is a shame that it wasn't at least 90-120Hz2- the back is a fingerprint magnet. while I don't really much care about this aspect but there are some who do. no matter how you do there will always be fingerprints at the back ALWAYS.3- trackpad right ""button"". it is quite confusing sometimes it works just fine and most of the other times it doesn't respond at all like I never clicked anything and I have to do the two fingers click.Summary:I am a guy that a 1700 USD are fortune for and worth months of saving. and I am a very heavy user that requires as much as a machine could offerI use it for gaminguniversity programming running multiply virtual machines at once ..etcit only required putting another 16GB RAM stick and all is good. I would totally recommend this investment and it is worth every penny.",0
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        6 of 6 people found the following review helpful       Love it! However  temperature is an issue.  December 23  2016By Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,First of all I love the look of this laptop. It's slim and fit my taste.It plays any game without any trouble. However the GPU temperature reaches 95 degrees celcius when playing DOOM. This is with a cooling pad. The temperature is scary high and I have no idea what to do to fix it.Playing games such as league of legends gives no challenge to this laptop so the temperature will stay kind of low. It will only go over 90 degrees if you play graphic dependent games such as DOOM or Ark: Survival Evolved.I'd recommend getting another laptop if you can find one at the same price with better cooling.Kevin,0
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        167 of 191 people found the following review helpful       KEYBOARD NO LONGER WORKS  October 20  2016By Phil,1.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,"***I HAVE AN ONGOING CASE & RMA WITH ASUS***I will continue to update this review as it progresses. You can also follow along in the comments section.I also want to sincerely apologize to anyone that purchased this laptop after reading my original review and now has this keyboard issue too. I really did love this laptop and was very happy with it. I'm a system engineer for a Managed I.T. company and I love computers I have been a computer nerd since middle school. I put a lot of effort into looking for a new gaming laptop and once I got it I wanted to share my genuine thoughts about it with the rest of you on Amazon.This keyboard issue is 100% an Asus issue I did not spill anything on the keyboard or abuse it in any way. The lack of help from Amazon and Asus is unacceptable and I hope that I have not caused others to experience this as well. If you did buy this laptop I and you have any hint of this keyboard issue and are still with in the 30 day return windows I highly recommend that you return it right now and get your money back.**UPDATE JAN 5 2017: I got my replacement laptop today. When I opened the box the first thing I saw was a paper with 90 day warranty for refurbished laptops which really made me unhappy. But after calling Asus and sitting on hold for a while I was assured that if anything happened to this laptop it would be covered under the warranty from my original new laptop purchase which continues well after the 90 day refurbished notice I got. I inspected the laptop closely for any physical defects and when I didn't find any I agreed to keep it and hung up with support. It still doesn't sit quite right with me that I didn't get a brand new laptop in retail packaging but since I can find nothing wrong with this one and I still get the new laptop warranty I'm willing to give this one a shot. So far so good as in the keyboard actually works. I put my SSD back in the replacement laptop and booted it up. Everything came back up fine Windows was activated still and no new drivers needed to be installed which is good. I am going to take this laptop with me to work for the next few weeks just so that I use it every day. I want to make sure that this one doesn't have the slightest sign of the keyboard issues before I consider this issue actually resolved.**UPDATE DEC 22 2016: I finally got an update on my RMA. From the email from ASUS... ""Your RMA status was updated yesterday the technicians were unable to service your unit so they will be providing you with a replacement unit. You should receive an email pertaining to the details of the replacement process."" I'm still waiting on the aforementioned email as of Dec 26.**UPDATE NOV 26 2016: I sent another email to Asus this morning since I didn't get a reply in over 24 hours. Two hours later I was sent an email with a link to create an online RMA. After creating the RMA I contacted Asus customer service via chat to get a pre-paid FedEx shipping label.**UPDATE NOV 24: My keyboard is no longer working and I have emailed Asus tech support. Tried the latest bios update and the keyboard firmware update neither worked. In fact I think the keyboard firmware update is what killed completely it because previously I could get the keyboard to work when this happened by shutting down and rebooting now that doesn't work anymore it's totally dead. I thought this was a Windows 10 issue because I have seen Windows 10 do strange things at the login screen before but obviously this is not that this is an Asus firmware problem. If Asus can fix this issue for me in a prompt amount of time I will restore my previous 4 star review but for now I have a $1500 laptop that I can't use without a USB keyboard attached... unacceptable.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I shopped around for almost a year before finally buying this Asus ROG Strix GL702VM-DB71. I looked at gaming laptops from Asus Acer MSI and Alienware. The appearance of the laptop is just as important to me as the performance. The Alienware laptops were just overpriced even on sale. The MSI laptops despite some good specs looked like bland square boxes with no unique appearance characteristics. The Acer laptops had a variety of poor reviews some had poorly laid out keyboards and most were difficult to install hardware upgrades. As soon as I saw this Asus Strix I was interested it looked really nice I liked the design of the case and the addition of some tasteful lighting effects and once I saw that it had the next generation of Nvidia graphics I was sold.I purposely bought the model with a traditional 1TB hard drive because it is cheaper to purchase and install your own solid state drive (SSD) than it is to get a model with it preinstalled. The laptop arrive safe and sound in a well packaged box. After unboxing the laptop I booted it up and before messing with Windows at all I immediately made an image of the factory installed 1TB hard drive using Acronis. Installing the solid state drive was easy it's accessible after removing the bottom plastic cover. With the new Adata 480GB SSD installed I restored the Acronis image and it booted right up.I have been using the laptop for about a week now. I have played Doom Just Cause 3 and Star Trek Online on it at max graphic settings. As others have said this laptop produces significant heat but I have not experienced any noticeable game lag or dropped frames because of the laptop running hot. I installed Core Temp and set a custom shutdown temp of 90 celsius which the laptop did reach when playing Just Cause 3 but since it was not hesitating or dropping frames I increased the Core Temp setting to 100 celsius and have not had any problems since. I also run with a laptop cooler under this laptop it is one from Walmart but it's pretty nice with two 80mm fans blowing air up on the bottom of the laptop.And now for the nitpicking (I'm quite OCD). There are a few things that could have been done better on this laptop. Firstly there are only 3 USB ports total two of which are on the right side. I feel like 3 USB ports on a laptop that doesn't have a DVD tray is too few 4-5 ports would be better (some of the MSI laptops have 4-5). Also the fact that two of the ports are on the right side shows some poor planning as most people use their right hand for a mouse especially when gaming and if you are using more than one wired device the wires can get in the way of your mouse. Another issue is that the right shift key is too narrow and more than a few times I end up pressing the up arrow key by accident. And lastly the plastic case shows fingerprint smudges pretty easily.The laptop did come with some bloatware but no more than I see on most other laptops I work on and removal of the junk programs didn't take long. Windows 10 has been working fine for me so far. I have been using 10 since it came out and have figured out some tricks I like to do to make it better (IMO). The very first thing I recommend to anyone using Windows 10 is download and install Classic Start (you can get it at ninite or classicshell) this will give you a proper start menu back and make the OS function more like Windows 7. If you are not going to be using the metro part of Windows 10 (the apps that are designed for mobile devices and smartphones) then turn off or uninstall as much of it as possible. You can do that in the privacy settings menu just go though and turn off everything. You can use a program called Ccleaner to easily uninstall the metro apps that auto install with Windows 10 (and it's updates) without even going into the app store. Lastly download and use a proper browser Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer are not your friend use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.Despite the few nitpicking things I don't like over all this laptop is very nice and I look forward to gaming on it for many years to come.",1
Laptops,B01KB0WKVK,ASUS ROG STRIX 15.6-inch G-SYNC…,        3 of 3 people found the following review helpful       A fine 1060 based machine with a nice display.  February 14  2017By C. Sulto,5.0 out of 5 stars,Verified Purchase,I was looking for a laptop that could use the Elgato screen capture device as well as play games have a nice wide viewing angle screen lighted keyboard and have a 1060 Nvidia but not spend over $1300 either.  This is the only thing I could find around December 2016 that fit my requirements.I returned a 4K Dell 960M based laptop (to Walmart) after it broke within an hour of operation (video chip issue).  I like HP Omens but found that this model was a better deal.  I also tried an MSI GL62 but the screen was not great (limited angle and washed out) and sent it back.I have been using this Asus for everything and can run a bunch of programs at the same time and no issues.  I do video editing as well and there are no issues and I am surprised at how fast this renders the final output.  There is no touch screen and it is only 1080P (the Dell screen was 4K and looked really nice) but this is fine.  I have 16GB of memory and see no need to expand it at this time.  There is no m.2 included however I plan to install one for the OS.  The Dell (that broke) had an m.2 and was super fast in booting.  The 1060 is great but the machine will kick the fans into high gear when you push it.  It gets a bit loud but not too bad (better than a couple of HPs I have).  Heat is fair but it does get warm when those fans are needed.Overall it is a fine well built and good working machine.  The weight is acceptable and the thickness is average.  The screen has a nice bright display with good viewing angles.,0
