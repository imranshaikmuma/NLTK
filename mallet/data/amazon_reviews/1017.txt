I like it except for the fact that I couldn't get it to sync with my FitBit charge 2 so I called Huawei and they stated they know about the problem and it could be fixed in the next update but couldn't give an exact date when that would be. The customer service tech seemed nice and informative.  The camera and the screen were fantastic for the price paid for the phone but the EMUI skin on top of android needs a lot of tweeking in my op. I returned for a refund however would consider purchasing after it's updated to Android 7
