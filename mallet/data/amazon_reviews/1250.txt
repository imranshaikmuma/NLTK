I am tall for a girl at 5'10 and it is hard to find scrub pants that are long enough for me.  Cherokee is the only brand I have found that has a tall pair of scrubs that are actually long!!!  I love the fit.  They do run large.  I wear a size 10 in women's and I am a small in these pants. They are comfy and don't really shrink much with repeated washings and drying.
