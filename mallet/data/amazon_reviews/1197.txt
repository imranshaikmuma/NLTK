When it first came and I tried it on right out of the package I was afraid it would cling too much in all the wrong places.  But once I washed it and got the wrinkles out it was great.  My ONLY complaint might be that the arms were a little snug.  Not uncomfortable and might be just that I tend to always wear loose clothes and wasn't used to it.  But I got a LOT of compliments at work.  This is a long way from things that I normally wear.  Its been a pleasant change.
