Bought this camera to take snorkeling to the Galapagos Islands. I got a great pic of a hammer head shark! Camera worked superbly no problem with water getting inside. I rinsed it off with fresh water after each use as recommended and  gave it a good thorough cleaning when I returned home from my trip. This camera is very simple to use. I loved the slow motion video feature available on this camera for under water filming.  This camera is also great to use on the beach since you don't have to worry about it getting wet.  So happy I decided to purchase this camera.  I will be using it for future trips.
