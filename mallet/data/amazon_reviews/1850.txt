Upon receiving the MacBook Air I powered it on and went through the initial configuration steps. Within a few minutes I was logged in and ready to work. The MacBook quickly found the list of available networks and it connected to my access point without a problem.  Linking my previous account was a breeze.The laptop was preloaded with El Capitan and I've since upgraded to Sierra via the App Store. After the upgrade the OS is approximately 8.5 GB. I tried to check the status of my apple support ( that new systems get) and I did run into some problems. I checked when I first booted with El Capitan. I have not checked with Sierra yet.I do like the gestures you can do with the trackpad but it seems a little too big for me.The MacBook's weight and exceptional battery life make up for it.Overall I like the MacBook Air and I think it's a great piece of machinery.
