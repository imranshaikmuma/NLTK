This system is excellent for those who just need a reasonable system without having to pay an arm and a leg for it.  Although  it can be kind of slow.  Be aware this is NOT a super duper gaming laptop.  If it was it would have a dedicated video card and an i5 at least.  So kwit yer beechn'.  It's even better for advanced users such as myself.  Why?  Because us advanced users like to upgrade the system.  Unlike prior versions of Acer Aspire laptops where you have to take the entire bottom cover off safely and slowly disconnect a dozen cables and then remove a bunch of random parts just so you can get to replacing the RAM or hard drive this system allows you to easily unscrew 3 screws and pop out the bottom to replace the hard drive for a faster 7200 RPM one add an M.2 SSD or upgrade the RAM.Note that it'll play 4K (2160p) YouTube videos kinda choppy because the wireless NIC is just not able to stream quick enough.  If you insert a regular Ethernet cable it'll work a little better but it'll play 1080p and 1440p just fine.Quick Summary of PROS:-Upgradeable.  Extremely easy to upgrade to an SSD replace the hard drive upgrade RAM etc.-Backlit keyboard is nice and only comes on when you touch the keys.  It turns itself off soon after inactivity to conserve battery.  Feels nice too and is quiet.-Battery lasts a long time if you turn down display (can go for about 8 hours as per estimation from battery popup - which I've found accurate - haven't reached 12 hours yet... I suspect 12 hours mean you put it on the lowest brightness setting turn off just about everything including lowering performance on the built in GPU and just staring at the screen or something).-I haven't touched the laptop for a week and after turning it back on the battery is at 100%.  The battery drainage is extremely minimal.  I've noticed a similar thing with a 4th gen i3 Acer laptop I own too.  Not so for my MSI gaming laptop though.  After 1 week 100% charge goes to like 15%.-The outer "metal cut" matte finish is awesome.  Completely fingerprint-proof.  This is how ALL laptops should be.  It's beautiful too.-USB 3.0 (Crystal Mark on my SanDisk Extrreme SD card capable of 95MB/s read/write confirms the USB port can mostly reach these speeds 95.7 MB/s read / 85 MB/s write with the SD card) using a Transcend USB 3.0 to SD reader.  My desktop computer does 95 MB reads and 93 MB writes.  My SanDisk Extreme PRO USB 128GB flash drive (rated at 260 MB/s read/write) does 263.4 MB/s sustained reads and 244.8 MB/s writes.-1080p.-This is the only laptop I found that has a backlit keyboard 1080p and battery lasts a long time and in this price range.Quick Summary of CONS:-I wish the inner finish would be more like the outer.  The inner is typical black a fingerprint magnet etc.  Maybe I'll buy some sort of armorskin (the type meant to protect phone screens) for it or something to prevent the annoying fingerprint smears.-The SD card reader is not that fast and appears to run at USB 2.0 speeds.  The same SD card noted above only did 22.83 MB/s read and 22.18 MB/s writes.-USB 3.0 slots are close to each other.  Large devices will not fit side by side.-BIOS isn't configurable much like a gaming laptop but that's expected.-No dedicated GPU for gaming but I already knew that before purchasing.  Light gaming should be OK.-Not an i5 but a 7th generation i3 is as fast as older generation i5's.-I use the only USB 2.0 slot for my wireless mouse.  Wish it had a second one to use for a wireless keyboard too.-Hard to remove battery in case it freezes.  Pressing and holding the power button down for a few seconds might come in handy to "force" shutdown the system in such cases.  FYI.-I just noticed right now the touchpad is sticking out/up on one side.  That can't be good.  See image I posted.UPDATE:  12/27/16  - I realize now why the touchpad is sticking up.  It's due to using the laptop screw to hold down the m.2 SSD.  I purchased shorter screws and now this is no longer a problem.  DOH!OTHER THOUGHTS:-Amazon did not package the device properly.  They only threw in some brown paper instead of air bubble bags.  The Acer box was flying around inside the outer shipping box.  Don't be surprised if your Acer laptop gets damaged or lessens it's lifespan from this poor shipment technique.-My other Acer laptop has funny "keyboard" marks on the screen because the rubber tabs on the screen isn't high enough to prevent pressure on the screen from pushing against the keyboard (thus creating a mark).  I now keep the fabricky piece thingy that came with the packaging in-between the keyboard and the screen.  Better safe than sorry.-I don't use the webcam or the touchpad so can't speak for those.  I put a piece of opaque tape over the webcam :p-Switch BIOS to UEFI so USB drives (i.e. Windows installer image) will load.-If you don't purchase new RAM you might see peeps like me selling the Kingston RAM that came with this laptop on eBay which you can purchase to make your laptop have 8GB RAM.  Who runs computers with 4GB these days anyways???Here's what I've had to do so far to get this system up to my standards:1. Install a Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 2280 SATA III SSD (Model # MZN5E250BW).  Make sure you get an M.2 SATA III SSD and not a PCIe or regular SATA connector type SSD.  If you get the regular SATA port type SSD it'll work but you won't be able to keep your regular hard drive.  I got it for about $70 during Black Friday.  w00t!  (This allows Windows 10 Pro to boot in about 2 seconds.  Yes you heard me right.  2 seconds).Crystal Mark confirms 551.7 MB/s sustained reads and 529.7 MB/s writes.4K Q32T1 (random read/write - which is even more important than sustained reads/writes) is 247.7 MB/s reads and 221.9 MB/s writes.2. Download the MediaCreationTool.exe utility from Microsoft so that I can download the Windows 10 ISO (which includes Home and Pro on the same ISO) unto a super fast SanDisk Extreme USB stick (200 MB/s read/write).3. Edit the USB contents (after creating the ISO from this utility) by manually creating a file called "ei.cfg" in the "sources" folder and add the contents:[Channel]_Default[VL]04. By adding this ei.cfg file with this info what happens is when installing Windows 10 from the USB stick it'll prompt you what edition of Windows 10 you want.  This makes it effectively an "Any Version" like Windows 7's trick.  Why would you want to do this?  Because Windows 10 Home is spyware central.  That's right Microsoft is spying on you.  Windows 10 Pro allows you to hack the system to prevent Microsoft from spying on you which leads me to the next point.5. If you don't do this "ei.cfg" trick thingy majjigy what happens is when Windows 10 installs it'll detect what's embedded in the Acer BIOS and thus you automatically get Windows 10 Home even if you unplug the slow 5400 RPM drive that's included.  And yes make sure you unplug/remove this from the laptop before installing Windows so it doesn't add unnecessary boot information to that drive.  Doing so slows down the bootup process AND causes Windows not to load if the regular hard drive is ever removed or goes down. Pretty lame "feature" from Microsoft.6. Anyways after unplugging the regular drive and using only my m.2 SSD (which I had to purchase some shorter screws to hold it down - I originally pawned a screw from the laptop to hold it down but this caused a problem where the touchpad was forced out of it's normal position.  DOH!.  BTW this is normal that no screws are included as SSD manufacturers for m.2 and mSATA SSDs do NOT include a screw) and then unplug my regular drive.  You may need to change the boot order in BIOS.7. When installing Windows 10 it'll now give you an option to choose Windows 10 Pro.  Complete the install.  Regardless if you follow my steps or simply just use whatever's included in the system when setting up Windows it'll ask you a bunch of random "spyware" questions.  Just answer NO to all of them except the "Smart screen" one unless you like to be spied on by Microsoft.8. Once Windows 10 Pro is installed simply locate one of your Windows 7 Pro/Ultimate or Windows 8.x Pro license keys you no longer use and use that license key to active Windows 10 Pro in the System Properties window.  You can Google where this location is.  If you don't know how to Google this you probably shouldn't be following my steps.  Don't make me use LMGTFY.9. Replace the 4GB (Kingston) RAM with 8GB HyperX HX421S13IBK2/8 DDR4 2133 SODIMM (2x4GB).  This HyperX RAM is the fastest I found.  It runs at CAS 13 (basically the refresh rate - lower is better/faster).  Now any true techie (not someone who goes to Best Buy as those are just wannabees) knows G.Skill is the king of RAM and has been for many years.  However the best G.Skill RAM I found ran at a CAS of 15.  These puppy has incompatibility issues with certain laptops but not with this Acer laptop.  It's rock solid.10. Replace the cheap 5400 RPM regular hard drive with a Western Digital Black edition 1TB 7200 RPM laptop drive.  Western Digital used to make "Blue" editions run at 7200 RPM but now unless you get the Black edition you won't get full speed.Crystal Mark confirms 144.2 MB/s sustained reads and 119.8 MB/s writes for the 7200 RPM Western Digital drive.4K Q32T1 (random read/write - which is even more important than sustained reads/writes) is 1.014 MB/s reads and 0.935 MB/s writes......Compare the SSD to the Western Digital drive.  Random read/write speeds are where SSDs (again good ones) shine.  2.0 MB/s is 100% faster than 1.0 MB/s so doing the math we get:-The Samsung SSD is 551.7/144.2 MB/s = 382.59% faster in sustained reads than the Western Digital 7200 RPM drive.-The Samsung SSD is 529.7/119.8 MB/s =442.15% faster in sustained writes.-The Samsung SSD is 247.7/1.014 MB/s = 24428.008% (24 thousand %) faster in random reads.-The Samsung SSD is 221.9/0.935 MB/s =23732.620% faster in random writes.-The 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop:Crystal Mark confirms 101.5 MB/s sustained reads and 91.23 MB/s writes for the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.4K Q32T1 random read/write is 0.811 MB/s reads and 0.885 MB/s writes......Compare the Western Digital 7200 RPM drive to the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.  The faster the disk drive is rotating the faster the hard disk headers can read/write to the disk.  Doing the math 7200 RPM / 5400 RPM is 1.333333 so 33.33% faster so that's about what we should expect.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 144.2/101.5 MB/s = 42.07% faster in sustained reads than the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 119.8/91.23 MB/s =31.32% faster.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is 1.014/0.811 MB/s = 25.031% faster.-The Western Digital 7200 RPM drive is  0.935/0.877 MB/s =6.613% faster.The differences can be attributed to various things such as cache different hardware and software logic etc......Compare the Samsung SSD to the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop:-The Samsung SSD is 551.7/101.5 MB/s = 543.55% faster in sustained reads than the 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD that came with the laptop.-The Samsung SSD is 529.7/91.23 MB/s =580.620% faster in sustained writes.-The Samsung SSD is 247.7/0.811 MB/s = 30542.540% faster in random reads.-The Samsung SSD is 221.9/0.877 MB/s =25302.217% faster in random writes.-Why are random reads/writes important?  The operating system constantly does random reads and writes as opposed to sustained reads/writes (which is typically when you're copying 50 GB of movies from one drive to another for example).  So if your laptop/computer seems slow get an SSD.  Thank me later.  Got it?  Note: this laptop uses M.2 SSDs. I specifically got an M.2 2280 type.  Make sure you get an M.2 SATA III SSD and not a PCIe or regular SATA connector type SSD if you want to keep your regular hard drive.-If you got nothing out of this at all what you should get is upgrade to an SSD.  Regardless if you replace the hard drive or not with a faster hard drive you are a dummy for not upgrading to an SSD.-The regular drive is to hold my documents pictures videos etc.  I always redirect my docs the Desktop and other stuff to my second drive.  Then I use Macrium Reflect to image (back up as a complete image) my Windows SSD drive.  If something goes wrong with the OS I simply restore the entire image in like 15 mins thus my docs are NOT deleted and everything automatically redirects back to my docs on the second drive.  I'm back up and functional in no time.BAM!  Now my system will be MUCH faster and you can do all sorts of cool hacks to prevent Microsoft from spying on you (which you can't do on the HOME version) and prevent Windows Updates from annoying you.With the Samsung SSD from a cold shutdown (i.e. laptop turned off completely) to Windows desktop takes about 4 seconds.  The time Windows start loading to the Windows desktop takes about 2 seconds.  What about the time it takes to load into Windows using the drive that came with the laptop?  You try it and comment on my review.
