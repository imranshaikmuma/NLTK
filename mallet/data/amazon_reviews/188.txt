I am a photography enthusiast and the M5 was the canon mirrorless camera I have been waiting for.  Great picture quality.  Fast autofocus with native M glass as well as adapted EF and EFS glass.  And tiny.  My only complaint is the auto ISO can be problematic.  The size and features make this a great walk around and travel camera.  22 mm m lens is a must have.  Also very happy with results from adapted 55mm.  Just ordered the m 18-150 mm.  This is getting expensive!
