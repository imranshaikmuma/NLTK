This is one of my favorite necklaces. It's beautiful and not terribly cheap looking. The chain has the initials 'LC' which stands for 'Lady Colour'. However those are my initials too which makes me like it even more. In sunlight the pendant is sparkly. Pictures don't really give it much justice. The size of the heart is just right. It doesn't look like costume jewelry which is what I was most worried about. I wish the chain was longer. Otherwise I'm extremely happy with my purchase.
