Great shirts. The 2XL fits me fine (6'6" 257 lbs.). These things are built like a brick outhouse don't stain and even the oldest one I have (8 yrs old) has no pilling or other sign of wear. I bought 4 as I'm trying to move to having a work uniform to eliminate having to spend any time in the AM getting dressed and these Dickies shirts are perfect. Only the double-buttoned breast pockets give away that this is a less formal shirt.
