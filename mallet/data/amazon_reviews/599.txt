I purchased this for my remodeling company - to time lapse projects. We used it for the first time on a kitchen remodel. It's extremely easy to use and setup good quality - not quite 'professional' but definitely use-able. A great starter to introduce yourself to time lapse and see if it's a good fit. The price point is appealing because it have us the opportunity to try it out ourselves without spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars. The battery life is AMAZING especially if you take their recommendation and get Energizer Ultimate Lithium - we left it setup on a jobsite for 3 full months and it still had power and space on the memory SD card. Easy to work with video files it does all the work for you. You don't struggle with hundreds of images it's already in video format. The main trick is getting your settings right - selecting the right time lapse photo intervals - we had a lot of blank space & it will require some editing clipping etc. But it's been a great starter tool for us to bet even more familiar with it & show people and prospects a different side to remodeling - it will be really cool when we have an outdoor/exterior face-lift type job showing ugly to gorgeous in 1-2 minutes! Excited to learn more!I also have to mention - we do some 'flip houses' - we recently had an issue of several break-in's - so we took the Brinno Time Lapse off of the current jobsite we were tracking over the weekend put it up at the flip house that was being broken into - mounting it next door at the neighbors property - and we were able to catch our intruder! The cool part was after the weekend we were able to simply put the camera back up on the original jobsite it was on and pick up right where we left off! Great product!
