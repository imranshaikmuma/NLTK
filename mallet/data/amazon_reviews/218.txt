I originally purchased this camera for photos of my family.  This camera has excelled at that.  The pictures are very sharp - you'll have no problem having large portraits printed.  In fact the largest print I've had made is 24" x 36" and it's crystal clear.  So far I've only used EF lenses but I'm seriously considering the EF-S 10-22 for wide angle group shots.The build quality is fantastic.  This camera has a magnesium body and can really take a beating.  Check out the Chinese guy on  youtube to see what I'm talking about.  I'm continuously pushing buttons and using the dials and have never had a problem.  I can see where the screen can get scratched if you aren't careful but to date my screen still looks like new.I've now had this camera for about 18 months and I've learned the controls and can take beautiful pictures but I have to admit that I wasn't impressed with this camera at first.  I couldn't seem to get a sharp image and had considered sending it back to Amazon.  I'm glad I didn't because with some practice I've gotten very good with this camera and am now getting requests to take pictures for friends and neighbors.  I've never charged anyone for this so I call myself a professional amateur.To sum it up this is a really nice camera and I feel that you can't go wrong.  Sure it may not be a 5d MKIII but it doesn't cost as much as one either and to be honest I can't really tell a big difference in image quality between the 7D and 5D anyway.  Maybe it's just me.
