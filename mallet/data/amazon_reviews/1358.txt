Beautiful item.  It's nice and very decently sized but I did find the chain itself very thin and on the cheapish side. The item is lovely and i bought it as birthday gift - birthday girl lived it. Just a pity Amazon doesn't deliver to South Africa and other countries directly so I had to use a third party to get it which added to the overall costs. Would be nice if the manufacturer or supplier and Amazon could fix this because it will help you sell more globally.  Thanks
