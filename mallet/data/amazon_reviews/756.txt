This re-furnished I-phone looked like it was brand new. I paid $399 for it. At about 95 days it stopped working. Would not charge or turn on. amazon said it was out of warranty and they could do nothing. I would recommend that you buy a new phone instead of a re-furnished phone. This was a lemon and I am out $399
