I debated between this macbook air and a MS Surface.  I couldn't be happier with my decision to get the MacBook Air.  It is incredibly fast loads quickly and it is so easy to travel with due to it's size and lightweight.  I also bought the Asurion warranty which seems to be a much better deal than AppleCare.
