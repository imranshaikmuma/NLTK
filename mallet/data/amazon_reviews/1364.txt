I was so happy to get these I couldn't wait to wear them! They are beautiful coloring and match the cherokee line scrub tops perfectly so far. (this color matches pretty much all Hello Kitty tops!) I love that it has elastic so it comes in at the waist instead of feeling like I'm pulling up a big tent on myself like the draw string pants do. When I sit the pants stay up and I don't have that super tight at the seams feeling that I get in other brands. I ordered a size up because I have had issues with pants starting to give at the seams early on but now I wish I had ordered my real size because the waistline is generous for an elastic waistband! These pants fit nicely but I do get the feeling that when I bend over they might be out of place so i find myself pulling them up habitually before I bend over in front of someone. I wish these had a drawstring in the elastic like the mens do. But for the price and fit they are much better than most scrub pants I've tried. I only order these style in womens because my favorite scrub pant the Mens workwear cargo elastic drawstring pants don't carry the "girlie" colors like pinks and lighter purples. I got the regular length and they are long enough even when sitting and I'm tall. I do wish cargo pants came with a "cellphone pocket" that fit modern cellphones the ones that say they do have a cellphone pocket look like the fit the old school Nokia phones but not a wide and thin smartphone but otherwise these pants are exceptional. The elastic has give so order your real size not up or else you won't be able to tighten them at all.
