I've had this phone now for a couple months. This isn't long enough to tell if it will be good long term but enough to tell if I like the phone or not.First of all I bought this to replace two dying LG phones- a G3 and G4 both with huge hardware issues. So far in that respect the Honor has been awesome. It works.Now down to the nitty gritty. Both of the aforementioned LG phones had qualities that I loved in a phone. Amazing cameras amazing displays removable batteries almost stock Android. The Honor 8 can't really hold up in that regard. The camera is not nearly as good as even the G3. It gets the job done so I don't really worry about it. I can't remove the battery but it has great life so I don't worry about it. And though I do miss stock Android quite a lot the weird OS Huawei installs is inoffensive and has some neat features (especially scheduled power on and off!).Also it has USB C. Huge plus. It has a very responsive and accurate fingerprint sensor. I thought I would miss LG knock codes but I do not.Overall this is a super solid phone with some great features. Does it blow me away like the LG phones did? No which I do miss. But I'll take stability over a non working screen or no WiFi.
