These shirts are the only ones my husband will wear to work. He has 1 in every color. Short sleeve and long. Only because he said every time he finds something he likes it gets discontinued. :-)They are 100% durable. Heavy weight cotton.The long tail will stay tucked in as well.They will go through many washes and never fade or shrink If you wash them in cold. I dry them part way then I hang them to air dry the rest of the way.
