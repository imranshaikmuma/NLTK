After comprehensive research I found this camera to be rated the best in it's class for all around performance.  The only real negative review I read was that the paint on the round toggle switch to change modes and shooting preferences wore off.  I figured this was an isolated incident as there was only one complaint of this.  I purchased the camera and I decided to take this camera for a spin on my trip to Central America.  After the second day of shooting the paint on the toggle switch began to wear off.  By the 4th day of shooting the paint was completely gone leaving just a blank round toggle switch!  Perhaps this was from perspiration or sunscreen or just the friction from my finger on the switch.  I contacted the company I purchased it from (through Amazon) and was informed it was past the 30 day warranty so I called Panasonic and they told me to send it into their repair center in texas and the part would be replaced.  The paint is not supposed to come off that easily and he felt maybe there was a "printing issue?!"  I of course have to pay for the shipping but the 1 year warranty covers the repairs.  In addition I had several occasions where the plastic 2 door shutter would not close all the way to protect the lense.  After shooting I would close the camera and the shutter would stay partially open exposing the sense to potential damage.  This problem resolved on it's own after turning the camera on and off multiple times but I assume it's going to be an intermittent issue.  For such a promising technological camera it's made very poorly.  If you do decide to purchase this camera I would HIGHLY suggest fashioning some sort of clear coat plastic cover over the round toggle switch to protect the letters from wearing off so easily.
