I've been purchasing Lee Relaxed Fit Jeans for years.  I bought several pairs about 4 years ago and they are still in excellent shape (not a single loose thread) but the colors were starting to fade so I came here to order new ones.  As many others have pointed out these are NOT the same jeans I ordered previously.  My old pairs are 99% cotton.  The new pair is 70% cotton and looks and feels cheap.  I can't believe the difference between the old pair and the new.  Lee should be ashamed of themselves for marketing this under the same label.  I am very disappointed and will be returning them.
