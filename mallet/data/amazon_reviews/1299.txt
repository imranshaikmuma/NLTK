My son is on the Cross Country team at school.  He's begun training on his own for the fall season ahead.  And he puts in a lot of miles.  And these are great for the chaffing.  As in - no more chaffing.  He likes these so much and they fit SO well I bought him another pair in another color (he likes the camo ones).  He loves the green color of the first pair I bought him and the look of these on.  He loves the way they feel on and that they are not so long that they peek through the bottom of his running shorts.For reference he is 5'4" 13 years old and ~115lbs.  I got him a size small and they are snug but not tight.  They fit how I'd imagine they are supposed to.
