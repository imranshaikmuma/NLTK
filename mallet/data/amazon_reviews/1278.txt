Absolutely beautiful!  I am 36B cup size 10 jeans and the large fits perfectly. Fabric and accentuates all the right areas! Can't wait to wear it on the honeymoon! Back of it has a tie that goes around neck and one around bra line (like a string bikini) and then features a thong strap that is actually soft and not very noticeable. Great buy was not expecting it to fit so well!
