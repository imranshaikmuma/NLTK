So far so good I love the fact that I can take this small camera everywhere with me. My only complaint is that my hands shake and I have trouble taking clear photos because of that. Still reading the manual hoping there is a setting that will help me with my problem. Otherwise I love it. Get a Case Logic QBP-301Purple Point and Shoot Camera Case  to go with it.  Small enough to put in your jeans pocket & take everywhere you go.
