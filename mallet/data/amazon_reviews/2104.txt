We got.this for our granddaughter because it is the exact same computer she uses in her second grade class. She is comfortable with it because she has the same computer both at home and school.The only thing I noticed is it doesn't support some of the apps that I can download on my regular PC. She can't download Minecraft (a game) for instance. I wouldn't have chosen this computer but she is very happy with it. I have yet to determine whether I can download Microsoft Office on it or not. But all in all this was perfect for the needs of our grandchild at this stage in her life.
