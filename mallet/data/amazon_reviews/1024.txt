Exactly 7 days using this device and I'm in love. It's performance is out standing it's camera is way better then I thought it would be. I tested its camera with an iPhone 7 and it's almost impossible to see any difference in some pictures the 6x is even better. So many of its futures come in handy. I get  one day and a half using it for phone calls all day at work. And tested using it as less as possible and I passed two days with out recharging. It's got an expensive feel to it and at its price you don't care if you take it work beach or even lose it. Great  phone!
