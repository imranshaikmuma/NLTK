I can't not tell you how much I LOOOOOOVE these! They are so comfy and fit so well! They are thick enough to not be see through but thin enough so you won't sweat to death! They are longer than capris but this is the exact length I wanted! I also bought the blue and mint green color. I'll be ordering the other colors as well! These are fabulous! I have not washed them yet or really got to "wear" since I literally just put them on but I don't regret my purchase at all. Such a great price for these! I'm 5'5 and I'm a size 9/10 and ordered a M.
