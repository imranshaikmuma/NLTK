The advertiser stated that the condition is good and the phone is used. I just want the seller to know that there is a sane difference in refurbished and repaired. What I got was a phone with replaced/ repaired screen and even that screen was not an original iPhone screen. Just for all you guys out there the way to identify whether the screen is repaired or original; (a) When you put some pressure on original screen you won't see any fade of colors while you will see colors heavily fading from the pressured area on the screen. That's third party low grade screen for iphones and are not of good quality at all. (b) You'll always find a thin gap on the sides of the screen and phone accidental exposure to water from the sides can immediately damage the phone. However when Apple replaces a screen its replaced via machines so there is no gap at all.How can you sell something like that? Selling cheap without letting others know what it could be is simply fooling others and by the way it wasn't cheap enough to match what you actually sold. Attached are the two images to show the gap.
