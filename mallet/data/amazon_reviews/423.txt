I got a refurbished item during the cyber Monday deals. I just got it today which is fine. The camera looks nice it came with all the accesories batteries and even the original box. I unpacked it and tried some pictures which came out very clear. I was just happy with my product until... 5 minutes later the screen froze and started showing lines accross the image. When I tried to turn it off the buttons would not respond anymore. I had to remove the batteries to reset the camera hoping it was just a one time glitch but unfortunately it kept on doing the same freezing problem over and over. I was just really hoping the problem would go away because I wanted to keep the product but it will have to be returned.I don't think I will be able to get another one as cheap as this one. i have the feeling that I just got a bad apple.I will keep on looking for a working camera again.Edit: As it turned out I was able to get the same deal with the same vendor. I just for the new camera today and it works great. The pictures are crystal clear the camera is very easy to handle and it does not feel cheap at all. So far so good. Another interesting fact is that I returned the defective Ã­tem today and I was just notified that I got the money back even before they got it. That is great customer service and I will gladly bump up my review to 5 stars both for the product and the service.Edit2: After using the camera over the holidays it seems to me that the pictures taken are not as sharp as those that I have been taking with my LG4 telephone. It probably needs a little getting used to but I have not been able to get a decent picture that I really like. I am using it @ 15 MP with the auto mode. I have only used it with interior pictures at night. I am waiting to take some pictures on panorama mode at a landscape. Probably it will work better that way. Still waiting for the perfect picture.
