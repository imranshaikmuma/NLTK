For boyfriend. He goes through them like crazy he's super picky and he gets these every time. They are the most comfortable most reliable as far as getting the same product every time and they last him longer than any other brands.  He works demolition and his hobby is cars so these are perfect.  They get a little dirty and bleach right up without falling apart after a couple beaches. Very durable. It's the only brand he'll get. Love that Amazon carries them.
