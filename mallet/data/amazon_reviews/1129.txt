I was surprised at how well made the black 25 steel boned latex version was that I purchased from YIANNA. I'm 5'8 and 190 lbs--about 25 lbs heavier than my typical weight--so I ordered a XXL. I can latch the eye hooks to the last row but it is more comfortable when I move around and am at work all day to use the second row.It smooths out my back and stomach pooch and doesn't show through my cotton winter dresses SO MUCH BETTER than most of the spandex-y shapewear I have worn. The first time getting into it is tricky but after that it is easy and so much easier than pulling on Spanx. I agree with other users that you will find yourself needing to order a size smaller pretty quickly if you are combining wearing it with diet and exercise. The benefit of buying a real steel/whale boned waist training corset is you can tighten it with laces and it will last for pretty much ever...but it will cost several hundred up front and you definitely can't work out in it. While I don't work out in YIANNA's 25 steel boned corset which appears to have spiral steel boning I would try working out in the fabric-only version. Great purchase legit seller awesome price.
