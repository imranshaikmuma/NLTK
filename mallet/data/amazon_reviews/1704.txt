These arrived today. The didn't look like cotton when I opened the bag. They were shiny. I thought that might go away with the first wash. It didn't. I looked at the tags and they say "100% Polyester!" Now I'm stuck with 12 polyester bandanas because I already washed them and still need to get cotton ones. Very frustrated. A waste of my money.
