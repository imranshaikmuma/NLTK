Having used the D300 for years in both personal and professional capacities I was always aggravated by the lack of  low light performance.  Being limited to an ISO of 800 without noticeable noise just wasn't cutting it.Upgrading to the D750 not only gave me the benefit of a full frame sensor but an amazing improvement in low light performance image quality and autofocus performance as well.  I have only had the D750 for a month but I am in love with it.  The combination of this body my nifty fifty and my 85 1.8 are inseparable
