This phone is a budget phenomenon. It packs in loads of features at a very affordable price. I bought three at launch and have not been disappointed.Hardware:  Good quality metal body housing a big and bright screen. The blacks are not as dark as one would like but still looks good. The expandable micro SD slot loaded in an old card well. Be aware that this phone prefers the high-speed card so if you're looking make sure to filter to that. The phone is 5.5" and coming from a 4.7" Moto X (1st gen) I'm still adjusting to the size.  The metal body is slippery so I'm currently searching for a good case.Software:  Huawei's Emotion User Interface (EMUI) is rather snappy. It zips around from app to app in a rather quick manner. There are times when the app stalls as if to think about what to do but it's rare and often quickly remedied.  My largest gripe is that free RAM is often much lower than the 2 GB limit.  I'm often at less than 1GB of free RAM and I just feel as if the phone is inefficient.  The absence of an app drawer is also missed. Users are relegated to creating folders and accessing all apps from there. It took me an entire week to customize but my phone is finally where I want it to be.Phone Reception:  The phone speaker is indeed rather hard to hear out of sometimes. It's not my network either. When using a bluetooth headset the calls are clear.  I'm using T-mobile moving over from Sprint and I miss Sprint's HD voice to other Sprint users. This is a network issue and unrelated to the phone itself.Other media features like FM Radio Recorders and video playback etc.. are all top notch.  The phone is an uncompromising offer. The fingerprint scanner is the most underrated feature. I thought I'd barely use it but I hate entering a password now.  You can store up to five fingerprints so you can unlock the phone in either hand or by other people.  You can even lock e-commerce app transactions behind a fingerprint scan.  I confidently recommend this phone.
