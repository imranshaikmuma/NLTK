Warning: The description for this item states it is 100% polyester. If that's what you're expecting you'll be disappointed as what I received is a 60/40 cotton blend.  The cotton blend material for this shirt is susceptible to all the problems which cause most people to stay away from cotton blend shirts:  thin cheap feeling material not shrink resistant.  Those who want 100% cotton generally prefer thicker material (5.3 or 6.1oz type shirts) and those who want 100% synthetic want lightweight shrink resistant and no-fade colors.  This shirt will deliver neither.
