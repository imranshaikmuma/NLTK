I purchased these shoes with the intention of using them to train for long distance running. The reviews were spectacular the brand is well known and the price is reasonable. The definitely hit all the criteria on paper however in practicality for running they are a flop.A true running shoe should not be able to bend in half athe the arch as these do. There should be more support in the middle with more flexibility at the toe. The "arch support" that they offer over corrected my natural tread patterns causing shin splints and quarter sized blisters near my cuboid (the outside of my arch). Despite trying multiple pairs of athletic socks (pumas feetures and injinji) the friction continued because the truth of the matter is that these are not true running shoes.Unfortunately I passed the point of return so all I can do now is give my honest opinion on these shoes. I suggest for true runners to buy either brooks or a pair of Asics that is actually designed for running not casual wear as this particular style is designed for. Please don't be swindled by the reviews a true running store would not sell these to a runner. In fact they wouldn't even offer them in stores. Go to a local foot locker Dicks Sporting Goods or any local shoe store that caters specifically to runners and have them measure your foot (typically a running shoe is half to one full size larger than a casual shoe) track your tread pattern and allow you to try on different pairs that are better suited for your feet. I know the convenience of online shopping is attractive to consumers but there are some things that should be done in person.  Buying a pair of running shoes is one of them.
