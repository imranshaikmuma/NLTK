I needed a phone and quick.  I dropped my iPhone 5 and shattered the screen.  I did the usual amount of research for a new phone here on Amazon.  This place looked pretty good and it was very straightforward in its description that it's really just the phone and a power cord in a box when it's delivered.  The phone works great and was a breeze to set up (which doesn't really have much to do with the seller or the product but just nice to know).  The only reason this is a 4 star review is because I think they replaced the screen with an aftermarket screen that wasn't the best quality.  All along the bottom of the LCD display there is a strange physical line.  It's not a line produced from the LCD lighting or not lighting up but what looks like a glue line.  I can live with it no problem but it's there.  Other than that the purchase has been a good one.  I hope I don't need to purchase from them again (because I'm trying to be less clumsy and I won't drop this phone) but if I needed a new phone I'd look into this seller again.
