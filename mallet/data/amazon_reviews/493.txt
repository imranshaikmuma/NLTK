All of these low-priced cameras suffer from a common malady: they are unable to correctly reproduce luminance values i.e. their tonal reproduction is quite poor. In other words they rather mangle a gray scale.I've checked out several point-and-shoot cameras (Canon Nikon Sony and Kodak) on a calibrated achromatic reflectance chart and did not like what I saw. The chart has chips of known reflectance which are supposed to be reproduced at specific values. Generally speaking these cameras reproduce dark tones much too dark resulting in a tremendous loss of detail in dark regions even in a brightly-lit scene. As a result shaded areas go into a black hole. I suspect the built-in jpg encoder is to blame. Taking a RAW file and applying a gamma law of 2.2 or the sRGB curve would hopefully give better results. Unfortunately RAW files require a great deal of space in memory and the cameras tend to be expensive.The Sony DSC-WX350 takes pictures which are just this side of adequate and are probably fine for the casual non-critical snapshooter. The camera's ergonomics and user interface are OK and the battery charges while hooked up to a computer via USB a nice feature. Depending on the setting the jpg files are of reasonable size enabling the storage of many exposures on a memory card. The lens is no great shakes and exhibits a bit of portholing. Again for the non-critical vacationer this camera is probably fine. If accurate photographic reproduction is desired you're probably looking at a much more expensive camera.Of the four cameras mentioned above I'm keeping the Sony DSC-WX350.
