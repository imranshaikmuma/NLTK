Well i bought this for my 4 y/o nephew b/c i wanted 1.not a kids camera abd 2. A waterproof camera so this was it! The picture is NOT that great i would say comparable to a kids camera or one of those action cams BUT its waterproof so he took it in the tub and i dont hv to worry about it getting wet which is so nice! He really enjoyed taking it in the tub for now since its winter time.. Hopefully it lasts till summer so he can take in the pool! I didnt find the menu hard to use at all and the batteries were NOT hard at all for me to get in (which is what a few ppl mentioned on here) one big thing i can say is that this camera requires a MINI memory card! Luckily i bought one that was both! But def make sure i look at that before buying one! I gave it 4 stars b/c i really thought the picture would be better but oh well! I can take pictures and videos as well!
