I previously owned the T3 and wanted to upgrade so I purchased the T5i (used) and have been using it since the day I received it. From what I read I expected to just receive the camera body but the seller included everything I needed to be up and running within a short span of time (had to charge the battery). I'm not a professional and this camera is very user friendly. I've yet to learn all the different modes etc. but for now I'm taking pictures that amaze even me. I'd recommend this for those who want great pictures but don't want to spend a small fortune. I mainly wanted this camera for bird pictures and here are two of my latest ones.
