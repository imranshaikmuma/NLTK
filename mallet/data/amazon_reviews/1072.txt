I just received this top today and can tell it's my new favorite. I'm glad I read reviews about the fit. I would strongly recommend to order a size down (at least with my body type) I'm 5' 3" curvy not huge bust (34C) 140 pounds and the small fit great! Actually had plenty of wiggle room. I'm can't wait to order more in different colors.
