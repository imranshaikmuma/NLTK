Although I've just gotten this camera I can tell you that it is the best point and shoot I have owned. I have two dSLRs a Canon rebel and a 5D. The SX40HS's image quality surpasses the Rebel (DIGC 2) and is just under the quality of my 5D. I previously used a Canon S2is and a Lumic DMC-LX3 and this camera beats the S2 tremendously in all aspects of photography while just beating out the LX3 in short range zoomed photos. I only have two minor problem so far; one that is that sometimes at full zoom the photos can look out of focus if you're not careful. Two when shooting at high ISOs as most point and shoots the photos can get a little noisy and are useable up to ISO 1600. Other than that there really is nothing wrong with the camera it's a great voice for any serious amateur or pro looking for a point and shoot for daily use.
