After finding a pair of 90 Degree By Reflex Leggings at T.J. Maxx and LOVING them I was thrilled to see that they so many styles available on Amazon too (for almost the same price as T.J.Maxx). I went ahead and bought 4 different styles at the same time to compare.-----------------------------------------Here is a list of the 4 styles I purchased:-Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small-Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small-Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S-High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small-----------------------------------------BODY TYPE: I am 5'4 135 pounds very pear shaped.I want my leggings to be multi-functional meaning I want to be able to wear them around the house around town to work out to hike and under my ski clothes.------------------------------------------Power Flex Yoga Pants - Black - Small:These are also great versatile leggings! I would say the waist is mid-rise which is very flattering for me and most women. Length is the same on the high waisted just a small bit of bunching at the bottom for me but I don't mind it at all. Good compression and stay tight all day. Definitely recommend!-----------------------------------------Natural Bamboo Yoga Pants Legging - Charcoal Small:These are the only pair from the 4 I purchased that I am returning and also the most inexpensive. While the material is very soft and comfortable it is mostly cotton with not nearly enough "give" for my taste. They are also EXTREMELY long. If you are very tall and thin go for these. I personally thought they were to snug around my calves and way too long to look normal on me.-----------------------------------------High Waist Power Flex Legging – Tummy Control - Black Small:These are AWESOME! Highly recommend! The length is a tad long but the minor bunching at my ankles doesn't bother me one bit. The high waist is comforting on those days when you want a little extra help keeping everything in. Very comfortable and good compression and stay tight all day. Absolutely buying another pair of these.-----------------------------------------Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Black S:These are the same ones I bought from T.J. Maxx and they are the perfect capri length for me. I would say the waist is mid-rise too which is very flattering for most women. Have good compression but are still very comfortable! I love these in the summer too since they are capris they look really cute with sandals.
