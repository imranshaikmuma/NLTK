based on reviews i ordered what i thought was a generally true to size fit for me.  Most reviewers said this fit pretty true to size.  I just received it and it's huge.  Size medium fits like a large or even an xl.  And now of course i can't order in a small because it's not Amazon prime for $19.99 anymore.  I would have purchased at least 4 of these in different colors.  Too bad.
