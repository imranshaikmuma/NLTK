I purchased this to record the construction of my new home which it is doing admirably. I am really pleased with it's performance.I did take one star off though as the waterproof case is starting to go a bit yellow after only a few months use. The part where the lens looks through is still clear though so it seems to be just a cosmetic issue at the moment. We'll see how the yellowing goes as time progresses.
