This Asus machine is the best Chromebook for the money you will find. I shopped over twenty different Chromebooks from Eight different retailers before buying this one. I went for the 4GB knowing that I want it to be functionally adept for a long time. I am writing this review on this product right now. If you have a limited budget and want a quality device this is the one. SD storage mini HDMI extra large trackpad solid keyboard beautiful resolution lightweight speed comparable to Intel machines and crazy battery life. I ordered this machine late at night on a Friday from Amazon and it was in my hands before Noon the NEXT day. If you have not given serious consideration to becoming a Prime member you should do it now. Deals like this are rare and as a Prime member you get first shot at stuff like this. My windows 10 machine is a like a pickup truck compared to this sporty super fast device.
