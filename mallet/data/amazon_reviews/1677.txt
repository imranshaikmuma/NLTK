Here's the deal....when you buy shorts or jeans from say Old Navy Levi's Wrangler etc. they are not sized true to size. They are sized to make you feel better about yourself not the actual size of your waste.For example I wear Old Navy "loose" jeans in a size 34"x34". I'm an averaged sized athletic built guy. HOWEVER my true measurements are a 38" waste and a 32" inseam. This is how Dickies Carhartt and most dresswear(dress pants) are sized...by your ACTUAL SIZE not the fabricated size most popular companies use to sell everyday fashion clothes.When you buy jeans that are a 34"x34" it makes you feel thin and tall....when you buy pants true to size(like Dickies Carhartt etc.) that are 38"x32" in doesn't "feel" as good to say you wear a 38x32 instead of a 34x34. See what most clothing companies are doing here?....making you feel good right? It works...marketing.So by taking my ACTUAL WASTE SIZE (38) and using that measurement to buy my Dickies and Carhartt shorts that are sized PROPERLY they fit perfect...imagine that!Bingo...the secret fashion clothing companies don't tell you. Suprprise you're not a 34 you're really a 38!Measure yourself....guarantee your waste is about 4 inches bigger than your "X" brand jeans say it is.Oh yeah...review of the product. Dickies shorts are great for work and play...look good and tough as nails. Highly recommend.11" shorts hit me about the knee standing and come above the knee sitting. These 13" shorts are slightly below the knee standing and at the knee to partially covering the knee sitting.Hope my sizing info helps others! Buy your actual waste size(measure it with a flexible tape) and I guarantee they will fit properly. This is usually going to be roughly 4 inches bigger than what you think you wear but at least 2.
