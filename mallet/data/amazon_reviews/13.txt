I love this camera I bought it as an upgrade from my Canon SX50hs. The image quality it's outstanding and blows away the Canon. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a step up without killing your wallet. Easy to use and the Snapbridge app is a fantastic addition go out and buy one today.
