the computer is slow the resolution is awful and the volume is not as high as i expected. When i bought this computer i though i was getting a bang for my buck but the truth is it's not worth the price. When I'm browser the computer lags and when i play games while having a google tab up it lags even worst. i went into to task manager and saw that the RAM was being used up by useless Lenovo utilities and other stuff I couldn't understand. I'm going to return it and buy something better from HP
