I bought one of these for my teen over the Holidays. He was ecstatic at the power the screen the layout - pretty much everything. Then a day later he unplugged his head phones from it to watch a movie with his brother and discovered that the left speaker did not work. A quick chat with an Amazon representative later (who did walk us through a few tests to make sure it was defective and not the notorious id10t error) we had a new chromebook on it's way and a shipping label ready to ship this one back.The new laptop arrived even before we had a chance to drop off the 'old' one at the UPS store!While the device is awesome and there are lots of other reviews that will tell you exactly how awesome I am just so impressed by how Amazon's customer service handled the issue. I always make sure to buy items that show 'sold by amazon'. Guaranteed excellent customer service!
