We want to preface this review by stating that we are big fans of Sony having purchased a significant number of electronic devices from this company since the late 1970's (With the first Walkman). We have rarely been disappointed. The Sony DSC-WX350 is a very small camera which is capable of producing excellent image quality in both still and video modes.It is capable of recording video in true 1080  60 P quality.The camera appears to have a very high build quality.The supplied documentation is very poor and it is very easy to confuse the input areas for USB and Power. There is a very detailed manual available online but we think a camera of this cost should have some kind of users manual included in the box.We found the image quality (especially when set to the highest settings) to be generally excellent and the same can be said of the video. If you want to record/transfer in the highest video quality settings (1080 60 P) you need a very high quality SDHC card as the video transfer rate is 28 MBPS.The following criticism is partially due to our age and declining vision. If you have excellent vision you can probably ignore this portion of the review.We found the camera controls and buttons to be very small hard to differentiate/discern and the controlling actions themselves to be somewhat confusing. There is no touch screen control at all and selections are made by various controlling buttons. This made the camera difficult to set up use and control.  You will find yourself frequently double checking which control your fingers are accessing.One interesting feature is the ability to change the aspect ratio of the still images.All in all this is a very small camera with a big performance capability.Touch screen control would make this camera rate 5+!
