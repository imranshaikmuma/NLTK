Great product. Just be aware it's thick. This because ASUS decided to create an affordable/reliable mid-range gaming laptop so they made sure to give enough space/cooling for its parts.If you're looking for a good gaming experience in a laptop and/or require the use of graphic intensive software but don't want to spend a lot this is the right choice for youRecommend it !!
