Great buy. After reading some of the reviews I was expecting sub par pictures. But after following some of the suggestions of people who had purchased the camera and followed the included instructions I am very happy. First things first. READ THE INCLUDED INSTRUCTIONS. You will find setting suggestions and much more. Secondly buy some good lithium ion batteries. And lastly invest in a 16 gig micro ad card. Even with my camera on the highest resolution setting we got over 5500 pictures with the camera. I am completely happy with my purchase and am thinking of buying more as gifts.
