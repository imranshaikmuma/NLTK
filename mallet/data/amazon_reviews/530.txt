I have had this camera for a few weeks and have loved it so far!  The zoom is great!  My pictures have come out crystal clear even when my kids are moving as I take them!  It is certainly not a professional camera I have one of those too but is great for travel!  I bought this camera primarily to take on vacations when my other camera is too big and bulky.  The size of this one is perfect and the features are great for what I need!  I have figured out how to post pictures to Facebook from the camera which is a cool little feature!  My friends have all asked which camera I have after seeing those pics as they have come out so clear!  So far I love this camera!
