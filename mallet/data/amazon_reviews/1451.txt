My father in law loves the Carhartt brand. We got him a bunch of Carhartt items for christmas and he enjoys all of them. They are great thick material. The fit is perfect and he says they are very soft and comfortable. Its long enough that when working it stays tucked in and he can move around comfortably. The material is awesome. He does a lot of outdoor work and mechanist type work. The shirt is durable and stands up to a working mans abuse. It cleans nicely and does not stain easily. They also do not tear easily. If you want a super comfy and durable shirt this is the one for you!
