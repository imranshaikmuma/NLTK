I just purchased this Canon SL1 package with the added 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Lens to upgrade from my regular Samsung Wifi Point and shoot. I am amazed at all that this little camera can do! The size is perfect and feels super comfortable in my hands unlike other ones I've held. The quality of the pictures produced by this camera are GORGEOUS and professional looking. I actually Shocked myself when I headed to the park with my daughter and just took pictures of her playing. I tried the video camera feature and was a little disappointed that it would pause the video when I took pictures (while in video mode). It may be due to me not knowing all the features of the camera but I'll get it. If you're a quick learner you wont be disappointed. I highly recommend getting the bundle being that it'll save you money in the long run. Also include the free accessories and you are set! I am certain that I will be enjoying this camera for many years to come and I very highly recommend it! Whether you are an amateur or a pro photographer you will absolutely love this camera! I've posted a few shots taken with this camera using the close lens and the 75-300mm one.
