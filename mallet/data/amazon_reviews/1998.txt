BACKGROUND: I'm a gamer (and a professor too :-). I wanted a laptop that could play my favorite game (Dark Souls 3) at max settings 1080p/30fps and also run R for statistical analyses.  Dark Souls 3 is a graphics-intensive game and my previous laptop could not even muster 10fps with its AMD A10 APU.QUICK FEATURE SUMMARY: The ASUS ZX53VW has an Intel i5-6300HQ quad-core processor and NVidia GTX 960M w/4GB dedicated RAM 8GB of RAM and a 512Mb SSD DVD (yes!) 2 USB 3.0 ports 1 USB 2.0 port 1 USB C port (smartphone) and SD card readerCUT TO THE CHASE: If you want the power of an Xbox One or PS4 next-gen console in a laptop this is the most inexpensive solutionâ€”it is the cheapest laptop that outperforms gaming consoles. This computer is blazingly fast. It played Dark Souls 3 (again a graphics intensive game) at max settings 1080p/30-35fps and at low settings 1080p/50-60fps.  That's BETTER performance than that you get on an Xbox One or PS4.Negatives? I don't see a pop-out for the battery so you might have to pop screws to replace.Yes buy this. Especially if you can get it for <$700 like I did during Black Friday!
