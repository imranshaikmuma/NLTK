My podiatrist recommended the product and wound up adding more arch and heel support to make it more to match my feet. We tried cork and felt. The felt is more comfortable and the cork provides more support (but was more difficult to glue on). So far after several weeks using both for hiking and long walks - no problems. I just use thicker socks with the cork added insoles.
