I just received mine and it's great. I love it. I wanted to have a backup camera for a short trip to Europe the next month. So I will retire my Nikon P610 which I will use as a backup and will start using this one. The photo quality is outstanding I'm including a couple of pics using Macro function. In addition to that its zoom capacities are amazing no complaints about it I'm attaching three pics that prove it. I do need to do more video recording tests the UHD 4K feature is brilliant! but the 7 minutes restriction is ridiculous makes no sense at all. About SnapBridge it works perfectly with my S7 Edge. It downloads pics automatically no issues to report on this matter. As a summary it is highly recommendable affordable compact-size and great quality all at the same time.
