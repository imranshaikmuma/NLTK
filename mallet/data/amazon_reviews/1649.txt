I hate these shoes.  Yes I gave a five star rating and I hate them.  I'm a cook and I have to wear non-slip footwear to work.  I have tried MANY different non-slip shoes over the course of a decade and these are the most reliable easiest to clean affordable and utilitarian shoes I've found.  My feet never hurt.  Let me repeat that.  My feet NEVER hurt.  But here's the thing.  These shoes are so ugly.  I hate wearing them.  And they do not breathe at all.  But they allow me to do my job without having to worry about my feet and that is legitimately all I can really ask of a work shoe.  So I will continue to order these stupid shoes every 9-12 months when the non-slip bottom wears out until I graduate from college and can FINALLY tell the company for whom I work to suck it.
