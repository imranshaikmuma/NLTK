I've had this laptop for 4 months and it earns its five star rating. It comes with very little bloatware that once removed boots in seconds. The 960m is a little under powered for the 4K screen but in general video games look and play well (I'd have preferred the 970m which seems to be the lowest NVIDIA card that is well respected for 4K gaming). The touchscreen is responsive though I don't use it much. Screen brightness and color richness is what you'd expect from a 4K screen and the difference from a lower resolution monitor is immediately clear.I think I remember reading reviews complaining about the offset keyboard and the trackpad not being great but these issues have not bothered me. Personally I prefer an external mouse to a trackpad on most occasions. Though the keyboard is inset a little far in the device meaning that you're more likely to rest your hands/arms on the machine.The aluminum shell gives the same feel as a macbook and the performance is undoubtedly superior.All in all this is the best laptop I've owned and I'll definitely look at the Zenbook again when I need to upgrade from this machine.
