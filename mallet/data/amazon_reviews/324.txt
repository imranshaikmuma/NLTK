I was trying to decide between the Canon SX710 and the Nikon S9900 both being 30x zoom and leaning towards the Canon but was fortunate in seeing that Canon was about to release a 40x zoom in the SX720 HS. I am delighted with the SX720. The screen is beautiful - as clear as an actual photograph  and the zoom is just amazing. The built in electronic 2x converter makes that an 80x zoom with even a 160x possible digitally. The software is just amazing - the camera can even take pictures by itself if a designated face in the picture smiles or winks! I primarily use the "Auto" setting but every other conceivable option is available - shutter or aperture priority manual just being a few. I really like the separate button for HD video too. It has an option to take about a 4 second video before each still shot it you want. It then collects these video shorts into a monthly album. All in all it is a beautiful camera light and sub compact as well so I can carry it at all times. It fits perfectly in the hand and has a pop up flash to reduce red eye. I highly recommend it for those like me who enjoy super zooming.
