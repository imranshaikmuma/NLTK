After buying a $500++ bigger Olympus camera and was severly dissapointed with the digital quality (even though I had previously had good luck with Olympus) I decided I would rather have a small camera I can slip in my pocket to get all of those can not miss shots.The best thing about this camera is the burst mode If you have it on the normal camera mode the green camera on the dial. go into the menu and set your shutter to burst.You can then take 4-8 consecutive photos with one pressing down of the button.I can then take great shots of my kids and uncooperative husband seems that first photo is always so rigid and then they let lose just that tiny bit for the perfect shot.Top it off with my Creative Memories Memory Manager Software ( a HUGE bang for your buck in photo storing and editing) I can clone from one picture to the next and get an almost perfect photo.I've done this with a group of men (who we all know don't cooperate) and got a great final product. I also did this with my daughter's baseball team and got a great shot of the kids.Well worth the price fun features great grab and go keep in your pocket or purse camera.
