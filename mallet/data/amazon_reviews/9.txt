I've had Canon digital SLRs since the 20D and have been using them personally and professionally for 10 years.  I loved my Canon Rebel XSi of years ago as well.  I really haven't had a Canon dSLR that I haven't loved!  I purchased the T5 for my daughter to use who has to take photography as a restricted elective for her graphic design degree.  I didn't feel generous enough to share my 70D!  :)  The price of the T5 is right but after re-visiting the specs we've decided to exchange it for a T5i since it's likely going to become my back-up camera and I realized the T5 doesn't have spot-metering and the ISO tops out at 6000-ish.  I'm still a Canon fan though!  I think for most beginners the extra $250 for the T5i would be a waste...I'm just an old pro and very picky.
