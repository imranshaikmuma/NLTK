We got this camera to replace our Olympus Stylus TG-630 which we loved but would no longer hold a charge.  So after a lot of researching we decided to give this camera a try despite our reservations about the low price and name we had never heard of.  This was a mistake.  Here are a few pros and cons to sum up our experience with this camera :Pros- Looks good- Selfie option is nice- Most controls were pretty user friendly- Decent pictures not great but not terribleCons- Battery/MicroSD/USB compartment are all under the same cover so when you open it to upload your photos the batteries fall out- Flash has to charge EVERY time you want to use it.  We were in a dark area and every time I tried to take a picture with the flash I had to wait 5-10 seconds for the flash to charge and every time I missed the shot or got someone right in the eyes with the flash because it doesn't tell you when it's charged you click to take the picture and get the 'flash is charging' message.- The videos are recorded in .avi format and Macs don't recognize this format.  And even my husband's Windows PC kept saying the files were corrupted & had difficulty with playback.- Once you enter Playback mode you can't easily switch back to taking pictures you have to turn the camera off and back on again to take a picture.All in all this camera has potential.  If the manufacturer can make a few small improvements it would be well worth the $80 on Amazon.  Personally I wanted more and there were too many little things that bothered me so I'm sending this one back and continuing my search for a Waterproof camera.
