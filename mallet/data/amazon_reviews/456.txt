We owned an older model of this camera so we bought this model to update our aging point and shoot. This camera has 'neat' wifi technology and a swivel view-finder.BUT I wish this model of waterproof and 'tough' Olympus camera had a lens cover; although we haven't scratched the lens yet I am sure it will happen as we are using it in non-delicate situations. I have already noticed that without a lens cap the lens is often dirty or streaky when I pull it out for a quick picture.I am also disappointed in the quality of pictures this camera takes. In regular light situations I don't see much difference from my phone's camera.I think this camera is also lacking the ability to switch it's focus point.Because we were so happy with our 2005-6 model of this camera I am disappointed that the technology and quality of this camera didn't improve in 10 years.
