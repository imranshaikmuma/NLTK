This is my second Samsung Chromebook.  I (stupidly) opted for the 2 GB version.  Let me be clear if you use a lot of extensions like I do or you have a lot of tabs open like I do I don't think the 2 GB version is for you.  Even with all my extensions disabled there is still noticeable "stuttering" or lag when opening new tabs or navigating links.The battery life is beyond exceptional though much better than my last Chromebook but this may come at the expense of performance and hence the lagging that I experience.  Still all in all if you can spring for the 4 GB model you may have a better experience.  If battery life is top priority I don't see how you can go wrong with this model.  Good luck :)
