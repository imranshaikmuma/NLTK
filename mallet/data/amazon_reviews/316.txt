For the price this camera is fine.  Would like an endoscope camera that either had an adjustable focus or a shorter focal length.  This camera has to be 2 or more inches away from the object observed to see the object in focus.  It runs nicely with Digital Viewer free software from Pluggable on my Windows machine and with CameraFi on my Android phone.  I tried a WiFi camera previously.  Problem with the WiFi cameras is you have to use the camera manufacturer's crap software.  This camera doesn't limit the type software to use.  I bought two of these cameras.  The lens fell off of one.  I'm still using it; the lens is for sealing not for optics.  Suspect the claim of being waterproof is an oversell which really isn't necessary for a product at this cost.  I wish there was a mid range version that had better camera quality.  Seems like there are only low end units for a couple bucks and medical grade units for a couple thousand bucks.  Would have been happy to pay 3x to 4x the amount for a better quality camera.
