i bought this july last year and i see now the price has dropped anther 100 bucks I was very pleased with this when i payed 1099 for it .I use this camera a few times a week i toss it in my car when i go anywhere and just pull over for shots. I am slowly learning how to use it i jumped from a point and shoot to thisnext i want to start trying out different lenses for itI have had it a little over a year now and i am still very pleased with camera. I have added a 50 mm prime lens a 17 -55 zoom for using indoors like museums and i just added a vivitar 500 mm f 6.3 mirror lens so i am pretty set now for a while.I do not shot movies much but the few that i have are very clear. I have done time lapse and long exposure shots. I am only an ammature but i sure am having fun with this camera.
