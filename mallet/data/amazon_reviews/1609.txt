Fit: They sit at the waist not below the waist which is a proper work pant. You dont want low rise work pants right? Legs are roomy and they tend to be on the baggy side towards the calfs which I dont prefer but thats the way they are.Material: The duck material is very strong high quality. It has triple stitching. Very well manufactured pair of work pants. Made in the USA.Color: Darker than an average khaki which I really like.Temperature: They dont feel warm but I havent used them on a hot day.I would take this brand over Dickies.
