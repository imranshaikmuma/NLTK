I love this product. It arrived lightening fast. I began wearing a 3XXL in Febuary 2016. Along with consistent exercise colon cleansing and portion control I lost 35 pounds and 4 inches off my waist. I am now wearing a 2XXL and should be on the third row within three to six weeks. In another two months I will order a 1XXL and continue the same process. This waist trainer does help me in losing waist inches and weight along with the correct protocol that works for me. I have the latex one for the gym and the satin one for wear outside of the gym. I highly recommend these for training the waist and for weight loss. The down side is that I have an excess lower tummy pooch from the weight loss and tummy squeeze.
