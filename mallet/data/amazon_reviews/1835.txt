The laptop itself is great performs well and handles my games like a dream absolutely loved it....Until after day 3 rolled around and the wifi wouldn't stay connected. After getting all my old programs redownloaded and installed (Some even paid for subscriptions that only allow 1 download per device) and getting it completely updated I called HP and went through all the possible fixes they had until they recommended a full system restore which would erase all my files and programs with no guarantee it would be fixed then. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone unless it's an emergency buy and you can plug in directly to the internet via cable which defeats the entire purpose of a laptop.
