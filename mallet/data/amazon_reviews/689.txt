The guys from unlocked world have attach an other label with 128gb but the phone is 64gb! So be very careful when you pick up your order they may have made mistake or intentionally make it like that... I will not take anything from them anymore! P. S. The phone works excellent!!! But is 64gb and I pay for 128gb!!!!
