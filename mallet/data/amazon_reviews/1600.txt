I was hesitant about ordering scrubs online as the sizes are almost never the same from brand to brand and are either huge if I get a medium or too tight if I get a small. Am very glad I took a chance on these pants!! I didn't realize they weren't even cotton or a blend but instead a loose ripstop type material that is super-comfortable and forgiving.  Also I don't think they'll need ironing if you just let them drip dry as the material has a wavy texture to it.  Reminds me of dri-fit clothes you'd wear for exercise.  They do seem to run a tiny bit big--I'm 5'4 and 120 got a medium because my hips are slightly wide but probably could have gone done a size.  Since they're drawstring though they don't look baggy.  Lots of pockets great quality they touch the ground without shoes and just barely with sneakers on.  Will definitely order some more.  I got 2 Peek-a-boo tops too and the colors are bright--again a smaller size might have been even better since the medium is very loose (34 bust) but not sending it back for this price.
