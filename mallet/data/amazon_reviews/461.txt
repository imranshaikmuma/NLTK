I bought the ELPH 170 IS to replace an old Powershot A470 that started having some issues.The positives: It's small & easy to carry. It's easy to use especially if you've owned a Canon camera previously. The LCD screen is adequate (the exact same size as the one on my old A470). It's not overly complicated to use if you're not a camera expert just put it on AUTO point & shoot. Maximum resolution pictures so far seem to be OK quality wise but take up a fair amount of space so buy an adequate SD card. No flash images are much better quality than my old A470. The flash is better as well it has a longer range than my old camera.The negatives: It doesn't come with any onboard storage for images. It doesn't come with a user guide. A manual is downloadable from Canon but that's up there with kissing your sister. It uses an uncommon battery (in the sense that you can't go into a convenience store & by batteries if yours fails). One strong point of my old A470 was that it uses AA batteries that you can get everywhere. Because it uses a special battery I had to buy an extra to always have a charged battery available. Not supplying onboard memory and using a special battery adds to the cost of the camera.Conclusion: The camera is easy to use does a good job. When you guy an SD card don't go too large unless you're going to take a LOT of pictures or do a lot of video. I had a spare 16GB SD card in desk and it's got space for literally thousands of max resolutions images. A 2GB card would probably be plenty for most people. If you're looking for an easy to use camera that takes good pictures this one will probably do you just fine. If you're a professional photographer and want to control every aspect of the shooting experience this likely isn't the camera for you.
