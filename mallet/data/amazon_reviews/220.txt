On it's merits it's a fantastic camera that is well covered in other reviews here. If you're trying to decide between this and the 5D Mark II here's some thoughts to consider.The 7D is nearly identical to the 5D in terms of specs in fact beats it in a few areas:- dual DIGIC processors on the 7D means 2X faster continuous shooting of 18MP RAW stills (the 7D shoots 8fps just slightly behind the 10fps of their $5k cameras!)- the 7D has a much better much improved auto-focus system vs. the 5D- when shooting video and monitoring on an HD monitor the 7D works as expected whereas the 5D drops the signal to standard definition when you hit record so you're seeing the wrong size and aspect ratio while you film.In the end the 5D's only real advantage is its full frame sensor which will deliver slightly reduced noise more narrow depth of field and since there is no cropping a 50mm lens is 50mm. Those are pretty much the three benefits of the 5D over the 7D. The depth of field issue is the one most often mentioned by those of us who use these cameras for shooting video but consider this - a crop sensor is roughly 25x17mm and motion picture film is 22x19mm. In essence this means you're getting depth of field very similar to what audiences are used to seeing in feature films with the 7D.The 5D Mark II is almost $1000 more so you really have to ask yourself if that extra sensor size is worth it to you. To me the 7D represents the absolute best balance of cost and performance on the market.
