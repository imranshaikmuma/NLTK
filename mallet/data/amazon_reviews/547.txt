I had to return this as soon as I received it. Everything about it appeared really great as most people had reviewed it. But when I tried to take sample shots I noticed that the view of everything in the view finder was very dark. (I tested it first inside my house which during the day is still fairly bright). The image also came out fairly dark especially if I then  tried to do a video. With all of the specs that I thought I had checked  thoroughly I neglected to pay attention to the largest f stop...it was 4! I have had a number of point and shoot cameras with the Sony Cybershot  being among my most favorite and they all have much wider f stops and take great photos inside with average inside lighting. I am going to the Galapagos Islands and wanted a convenient  underwater camera and needed to replace my regular cameras for this trip. As soon as you are in an environment that is less than optimum lighting you are in trouble with higher ISOs grain and getting a poor image unless you flash. You can imagine how difficult it is to get shots with this if you then try to zoom in on a shot which reduces the f stop even more. Since lighting underwater is at a premium this slow f stop essentially makes this underwater camera unusable. I was so disappointed. Amazon was great about the return (as usual) and it only cost me a $5 reshipping charge by UPS (it had lithium batteries in the shipping)
