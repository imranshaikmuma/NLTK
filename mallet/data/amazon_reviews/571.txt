The HTC Re is great if you understand what you are buying. It definitely fits a need. It is not a perfect product and a 2.0 version is definitely needed but I am not unhappy with this item by any means.I chose the orange color mainly because it was cheaper and didn't want the white and have to worry about the dirty on the white one. I did get a white one from Best Buy which I returned before buying this one from Amazon. The one from Best Buy did show the crack near the base as others have noted. I believe I may have done this during opening of the package. The packaging is a little hard to figure out at first. Make sure you unscrew the base from underneath before you try to remove the camera. Take a little time twisting the base before removing the camera and don't tear into it like a lion into a gazelle like I did.I love the always on capability of it. Pick it up and shoot no waiting at all. Wide angle is fine the ultra wide angle is really not needed but is an option. The waterproof option is great. Connecting to the app is a little bit of a pain in the ass because you have to switch your wifi to the wifi of the camera in order to transfer the pics to your phone or tablet. A pain but not a deal breaker. One thing I do not like is that the USB cord is only used for charging and not data transfer. So to transfer pics to a computer you need to remove the memory card. The pics are not top quality and you can get better pics with your phone however the benefits of always on waterproof and the wide angle far outweigh any negatives. Its a great camera at a great price. You will not be disappointed. I haven't been.
