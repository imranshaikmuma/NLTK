I have been buying and wearing these FTL boxer briefs for 20 years happily.  I tried other fancier boxer briefs hoping for perhaps a bit more longevity (these do develop holes in the crotch seams after two or three years) but came back to these for the fit and comfort.  I just needed to restock this past August and ordered the same Mediums I've gotten for twenty years and they are measurably smaller than the set I bought late last year (and have not lost any elasticitiy).  They have been causing me issues though it's past the return period now.  Going to try Large I guess.
