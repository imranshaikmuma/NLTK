The simplicity of this point and shoot makes it very nice for basic photos.  I primarily use it for capturing memories at family events and other parties.  The purpose is to capture events in better quality than a smartphone but still be very portable and versatile.  Especially indoors the low-light photos from point and shoot is far superior to the smartphone.The main reason I chose this specific point and shoot was for the software and micro-HDMI output directly to the Television for quick and easy slideshows.
