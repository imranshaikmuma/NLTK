they're ok.. nothing spectacular.. "wonderflex"? I "wonder" where they got the idea that they were stretchy.. because these are simply scrubs.. no more stretchy than any other scrubs.. I bought a larger size because I didn't really think they'd be "flexible".. called it.. they're not really.. I wear an 18 in normal pants and I have to roll the waist down and keep the drawstring pretty snug because they're pretty big..
