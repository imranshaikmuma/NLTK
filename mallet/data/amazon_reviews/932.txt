I spent a lot of time looking for a quality mid-priced phone. After narrowing it down I found the Moto Z Play an appealing choice. My other choice would have been the ZTE Axiom 7 but I saw complaints about weak signal reception and lets face it if you can't get reception the phone is going to make you unhappy. Back to the Moto Z Play - Display is vibrant and sharp. Processor is quick even with multiple apps up...No lagging. Love the Motorola unique gestures. Double chop - flashlight turn upside down - silent mode flick over - activate camera and pass hand over to see notifications. I find myself passing my hand over my wife's Apple out of habit. I've seen some criticism of the camera but pics are excellent in daylight and certainly acceptable for night time shooting. The battery life is excellent and the phone charges quickly with turbo charge. And if you want slap on a battery back and go even longer between charges. Wi-Fi range and LTE reception is great. Also there is of course a headphone jack. I would have considered the next Motorola up but with no headphone jack it was no deal! Bottom line - The Moto Z Play is a solid mid-priced phone that performs as well as phones costing much more.
