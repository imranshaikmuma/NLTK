Great camera for any beginner who wants a more professional photo.  Easy to use and we love the touch screen.  The lens it comes with is good and versatile unlike some other kits.  We did buy a 50mm lens that is also amazing with this camera.  We bought this camera while expecting out first child instead of paying a photographer and it was one of the best purchases we made to help record beautiful moments.  No filters needed.
