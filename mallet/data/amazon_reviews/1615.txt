I spray this stuff all over my Bearpaw suede boots with two layers after 4 hours as instructed. Even in the winter with the snow we've had nothing gets through my boots and no snow or water sticks! Everything slides right off like it should with this silicon spray. I have not ha any stains or weird marks from using this on my boots. Plus you get A LOT in the one 12 oz for cheap! I will be buying this from now on!!
