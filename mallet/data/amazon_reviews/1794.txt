This lab jacket is exactly what Ive been looking for for work (I'm a dental hygienist). Its very comfortable and has a nice slim fit! But not too snug. Its not boxy like other lab coats. I'm 5'4 and about 150 lbs and the size medium fits perfect. Will definitely be ordering more colors! I love Cherokee.
