I purchased this camera about a week after it was released. I previously had a D5300(dropped it) and I was unsure if I should get a D7200 or The K-3II both being in the same price point. Ended up going for the K-3ii.No flash: I don't use the flash as much and saw myself carrying a separate flash unit even when I had the d5300.GPS: I was skeptical about the GPS on this one. The built in GPS on the D5300 would take about 10 seconds to adjust. So every time the screen turned off it would have to look for the GPS signal and it was a battery killer. The GPS in the K-3ii takes about 2 seconds and doesn't affect the battery as much.Weather Sealed: I paired it with a 18-55 mm WR lens I haven't used much the WR since California is currently in a drought but it will come in handy eventually. There aren't many WR lenses available. I use a 35mm prime and would buy a 35mm WR in a heartbeat (50mm WR is available tho)Lens: Works with every pentax lens. I currently have it paired with an 18-55 WR Pentax 35mm f/2.4 Pentax and an old Pentax-M 50mm f/2. All works perfectly the newer ones focus very fast. The old one doesnt have AF.Body: Sexy magnesium-alloy body. The style is different from Nikons and Canons its more squary which I liked.Viewfinder: Pentaprism enough said.CONS: 1. It can't toast toast.
