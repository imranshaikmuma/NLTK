Cons:- No toggle light for num lock. It's weird that they didn't include that since caps lock and the power button have it.- Optimized for use with Windows 10 only. Only an issue if you really want Linux on it. Very annoying issues with fan control and overheating.- Glossy screen I don't really have an issue with it I'm sure some would. Will get fingerprints on it very easily but it's easy to clean with the microfiber cloth that's included.- ICEpower audio driver makes speakers very quiet even at max volume. I uninstalled them and only use the realtek drivers. Speakers are about twice as loud after doing that.- Power brick is large but sleekPros:- Very good price IMO. Found it for $1350.- Power cable is angled- Awesome screen. Not the best 4k display I've seen but definitely good enough for me. Touchscreen works well but I don't really care for it. Every now and then it comes in handy though.- Great CPU and GPU- Great touchpad. Feels good to use very smooth. Multigesture works great. I have big hands and don't have any issues with my palm getting in the way.- Full HDMI USB-C and 3x USB 3.0- Light enough that it isn't a burden heavy enough that it feels good to hold.- a e s t h e t i c
