I normally do not need to do a review on items that I have purchased on Amazon and although I do not purchase computers on Amazon I did in this case as one of my grandson's needed a new computer and since he is a young teen I did not want to invest in something super expensive just in case as kids will be kids.So once I received the system I unpackaged it and charged the battery and while that was taking place I went out on the Dell website to look up documentation such as user and service manuals which I generally do with all my computers.  I also checked on a replacement battery just for the fun of it and got an unexpected comment from Dell indicating that Dell replacement batteries are not available for this model as it is a "DISCONTINUED" product which was quite surprising as the Amazon description indicates it is a 2017 Newest Dell Inspiron which apparently is not the case so buyer beware.If you looks closely at the Dell shipping box you will find that there is a new sticker placed over the system description showing it as advertised although looking closer you find that the system was manufactured in the 2015/16 time frame so again beware.Putting everything above aside and from other reviews it apparently is a pretty good system especially with a touch screen although in our case it was not really needed but nice just the same.  The real acid test is once it is up and running he will run it pretty good and we should within the next week determine if it's a pig or performs fairly well He does play games even Minecraft and although this system was not bought to be a game machine we are hoping that he will be a able to see somewhat of a difference since he is coming from a 4 year old Toshiba I-3 standard machine going to an I-5 so there should be a little bit of a performance enhancement.The only real message is that this is a discontinued system so folks just need to be aware. based around the description on Amazon
