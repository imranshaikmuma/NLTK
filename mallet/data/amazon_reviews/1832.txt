I'm in college and needed an inexpensive laptop and found this one. It's great since it has 500gb of storage and CD drive which most laptops these days don't come with one. The computer itself is pretty fast and haven't had any problems. The keys and touch pad feel very responsive. Great inexpensive laptop that can do the job.
