best laptop on the market for the price. just wish it had an amoled screen instead of a lcd but for the price i cant complain. viewing left to right doesnt distort the image one bit it just has a small up and down veiwing angle than id like.i can even run halo 5 forge on max graphics and only uses 70 % of the cpu and 7.5 GB of ram (i installed another stick FYI)the battery holds a charge for a long time. im very impressed with the battery life for being such a small battery.at a idle it says about 12 hours (i like how the GHZ drops to .7 while just doing simple stuff then jumps up to 2.8 when needed) this saves alot of power. i like the back lit keyboard and the SSD is super fast and boots fast. as well the HDD slot is open so i dropped a 500GB on top of the already 256 Gb SSD. the speakers are okay and better than i expected.people complain about the cheap plastic on the out side. i dont mind the bottom is this fabric textured gunmetal gray that actually looks cool with a smooth lid. for the price its great.no bloat-ware which is a added bonus.no problems with the wifi and it always connects and very quickly.while browsing it says about 8 to ten or while using a word program.minecraft/ halo spartan assault about 4 hourshalo 5 an hour at best
