I live in New England so I need a good hat from time to time. I have a bigger head so finding a hat that fits is generally an issue. It either fits and looks dumb or doesn't fit and does protect. This hat is the solution to my troubles.The hat unlike the A205 will come right over your ears all the way. This will completely cover your ears in a double layer of fabric all around your head. The fold is adjustable so it can be as hipster beanie or tight laced as you please. The tag is easily removed if you so wish. The hat must be hand washed or it will pill and shrink like no one's business but it clearly says that on the label. Headphones will work over this hat just fine but earbuds will probably hurt as the double fabric will push them into your ears.The hat can be a little tight on the ears maybe because I have a big head but it should be noted. The hat retains moisture pretty easily. If you're inside or it's warmer than 45F expect to sweat in this hat  a decent amount which will then be trapped in the hat and then make the hat smell. It takes a while to dry. I found with prolonged use that my ears felt a little sore.Pros: Warm hat for cold weather fully covers ears with double layer fully adjustable works with headphones (not earbuds)Cons: Retains moisture could put pressure on ears which can cause soreness does not work with earbuds takes a while to dry not a great hat for weather above 45FI love this hat it's wicked comfortable to wear in the cold and makes life easier.
