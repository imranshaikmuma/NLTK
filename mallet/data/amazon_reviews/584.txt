I like this sony... Having owned the DSC-RX100 version 1 and now an owner of V. 3 I'll say this: if you can afford it go for V. 3 if you can't go for V. 1 and wait until V.3 comes down in price!  There wasn't enough of a change between this and the first version to warrant the upgrade in my opinion. Similar features MP rating lens etc.  The viewfinder articulating doesn't make much difference UNTIL you get to V. 3 where they intelligently made it so it flips into a "selfie mode."  This is a game-changer as taking self-portraits when you travel becomes quick easy and predictable.  With V.2 the articulating screen is more of a little novelty but not that horribly helpful.In short there's nothing wrong with this camera but there's nothing particularly right.  I returned it shortly after purchase finding it to be a sorry replacement for my (broken) v.1 and instead went with V.3 which is absolutely phenomenal!
