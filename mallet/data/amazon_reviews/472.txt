I purchased this camera almost a year ago and have taken it to the coast of Maine the jungles of the Yucatan the canyons of Utah and birthdays anniversaries and other parties in between.  It has never failed me.  I love the pop-up viewfinder which is a godsend in super-bright shooting.  The low-light performance beats my DSLR hands-down every time.  The camera feels solid in your hand despite its compact size and the majority-metal construction makes it a tough rugged device (even in my accident-prone hands!).  That Sony managed to pack all this power into such a compact size is still amazing to me but I am grateful every time I can slip the RX-100 into my pocket and leave my bulky (beloved) Nikon behind.  The Wi-Fi feature has also been a huge plus for me - I feel like I get a lot more out of the moment when I can share it with my friends and family rather than waiting a week or two for me to return home from a trip and download it from a memory card.There are limitations of course.  Mainly the field of view is not as wide as I would like for landscape shots the depth of field is insufficient for some artsy close-ups and the zoom is respectable but necessarily falls short of what you get with a telephoto lens.  I also routinely carry an extra battery because this little demon can run through a full battery in a few hours of continuous shooting.  Overall though this is a great camera for an advanced amateur photographer looking for a more compact option to supplement a steady DSLR habit and it's a particularly good choice for people who take a lot of low-light photos where this camera exceeds even the capabilities of some DSLRs.
