I LOVE this camera. Its been on numerous trips with me such as North Carolina Washington DC the Adirondacks Cape Cod Baltimore and so many more. The quality is SUPER nice and the audio from videos is VERY crisp. This was my first DSLR and I would recommend this to anybody whos looking for a nice simple DSLR with auto and manual settings. Ive had this caera for almost a year now as well and its highly durable! Its been in boats cars tree tops boxes waterproof bags you name it. I love my little D3300 and I hope you will too!! 100 outta 5 stars! (if you like my photos follow me on instagram @emmie.phorourke)
