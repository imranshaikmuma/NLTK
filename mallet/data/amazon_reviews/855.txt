I bought this phone to replace my firephone that crashed. I was intrigued with the specs on this phone. My wife has a Samsung S7. The specs are very close. Asus has 3.5 gig memory Samsung has 3 gig. They both use android 6.0 marshmallow OS. Cameras are very similar. Asus  does not have wireless charging. Asus has a bigger screen. Other than those differences they are basically the same with a much lower price tag. Storage is the same. I like my new phone very much. I think I got a great deal at under $400. I bought an amazon deals item which was $40 less without the box. Perfect condition.
