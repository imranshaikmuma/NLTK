I normally wear a medium in 90 degrees by reflex. I purchased the navy with polka dots and leopard. Here are the fits as follows for reference.Navy polka dots- have more of a yoga feel. They are not super high waisted and fit well. I am 5'2" 140# (bigger thighs). I was worried about them being super see through or white. They are a little when squaring down but nothing crazy like someone else mentioned with the black and white polka dot pantsLeopard- these feel more like thick leggings. However still great quality. They do not slip and hold to my body better than the navy polka dots. I ordered these in a medium as well. These could be dressed up or down. One thing I like is there is a thick waist band with their brand of leggings. These do not show any "white" under the fabric and are not see through. I really like how soft they are.The material of both are quality and polyester and spandex (just different % of blends). I will be ordering more. I usually wear a variety of brands when it comes to leggings and yoga pants. These could be described as a step down from lululemon but nicer than old navy. I work out five times a week and so far 90 degrees by reflex has held up extremely well.
