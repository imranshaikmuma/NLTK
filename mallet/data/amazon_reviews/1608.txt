These are the standard by which all work pants should be judged.Very durable fabric nice roomy fit useful pockets and great American made quality stitching.I work 60+ hours a week around industrial machinery and some pretty nasty chemicals. I get about a year out of a pair before the crotch and pockets finally give. That's a record.These might cost a bit more than Dickies and even some other made in the USA brands (looking at you Roundhouse and Stan Ray) but the quality really is much better. There's a reason everyone tries (and in my opinion fails) to copy the old B01.My only small gripe is I wish they still came in a 28" inseam and offered them in Navy or denim.
