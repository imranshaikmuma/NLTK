Unlike the shirts the snugness of the shorts have loosened a little bit but not horribly and I would still recommend them. As they are compression shorts and not underwear you would be better supported with a sports brief or jock strap to keep everything where you want them to be at the gym (otherwise you may require constant readjustment). I wear a US medium normally and I ordered the US medium from the site (even though there seems to be a lot of people who say to get a size or two up) and the medium fits perfectly (I'm 5'8 and 180 lbs).I also like how you can get matching tops and bottoms unlike under armour or most other compression and sportswear lines. I have the navy/bright green royal blue/light blue and the gray/black and wear them under my gym shorts and t-shirts.
