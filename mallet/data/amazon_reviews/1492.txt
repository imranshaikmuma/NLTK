Love these scrub pants!  They are so comfortable that I am in the process of converting all of my scrubs to this style.  They run a little roomier in the thigh than some others but without being baggy of bulky confirms to your leg shape.  A perfect fit.  The drawstring combined with some elastic allows for a comfortable fit in the waist and they don't show any unwanted skin in the back when bending.
