I LOVE this hat!! It is so well made and really really cute. The detail on the cable knit is really impressive. I read through the reviews before making my purchase but I was still a bit skeptical due to how inexpensive this hat is. I'm glad I decided to give it a try though! This hat fits very well (I have kind of a big head haha. Even with my head size I can still get a nice "slouch" going on this hat!) I really like how warm this hat and like how thick it is. Again considering the price I didn't expect it to keep my head all that warm. But this hat is really made well. This makes the perfect Winter hat! This hat is stylish warm and well made! I recommend buying it!
