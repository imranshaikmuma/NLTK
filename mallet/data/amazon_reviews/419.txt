This is a great little camera for a great price. The zoom is incredible! Shortly after purchasing it we took it on our beach vacation. From 18 floors up we could zoom in on things down on the beach with remarkable clarity. We were able to get some amazing pictures! It takes wonderful sunset pictures. Sometimes it is a little slow taking a picture but other than that we love everything about it. It is awesome!
