What an amazing computer! I never bought an Intel five before and I was afraid it would be slow as I am used to until seven. This computer is incredible !!!  The screen is large and beautiful HD quality and I was afraid it would be heavy but it's not a heavy computer at all. I highly recommend this and I give it five stars.
