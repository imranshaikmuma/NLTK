At this price I wasn't expecting much just a cute little camera that conveniently used standard batteries for snapshots while travelling. It is cute and lightweight but this camera is junk. Even at the highest settings the photos were grainy and blurry. I can't imagine who would be satisfied with the terrible photos. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
