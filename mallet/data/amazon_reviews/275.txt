Good product for the price and I am very happy. I do however have a few point that might need attention! *the front/Chest (adjustable) Strap is too short and does not ajust wide enough! I am average built and can tell you that if you are a bit big then this will be something that wil be a pain in the backside to deal with! (Just make it longer so that it can adjust better! )*adding clips to conect the straps to the harness will be a great feature! Would I buy it again? Yes!
