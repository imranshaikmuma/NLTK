Very nice shorts for summer work in Florida. These shorts fit as expected and the leggings are nice and roomy for a cooler feel. At first the material seems stiff but another reviewer says it will loosen a bit and feel less stiff with wear. These shorts seem to be made from durable material much better than the shorts I wore for work before. And yes no button above the zipper it is clip-style like with dress pants.I had to take off one star from what would have been a 5 star rating because the front pockets (that hold your keys change and other items) seem narrow and shallow. I'm concerned about losing my pocket items during regular use. I may have to resort to a zipper equipped fanny pack for essential items.
