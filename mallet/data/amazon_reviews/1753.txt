Slightly over sized but that is because this is a top that you need to be comfortable in for work/school. I typically wear a large but have been wearing a medium more recently. I bought three of these tops in a medium and they fit me perfectly. I was worried there would not be enough room in the chest area (I am a 36D and some mediums are too small) but this size is perfect. If you are unsure of sizing I would recommend trying tops on in store and ordering on line for a cheaper price. That is what I did.It is a scrub top therefore it is not extremely flattering but it does not look or feel like a potato sac. I love this color it looks great with brunette hair. Now that I know I like this top I will be ordering more.When reading reviews keep in mind that people always have something negative to say.I WOULD definitely recommend this product.
