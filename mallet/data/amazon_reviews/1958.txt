Bought 2 for my kids for Christmas.  They love it.  Best computer for all your basic needs (ex: emails social media school reports watching videos etc.). Perfect size for your lap and lightweight.  I would also suggest buying a comparable size fan to keep the laptop cool.  They were given the Belkin CoolSpot fan to keep the computer cool.  It's the perfect pairing.  Can't beat the price for what this computer offers.
