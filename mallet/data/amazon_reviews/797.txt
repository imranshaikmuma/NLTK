I needed an unlocked sim card phone for a trip to Costa Rica.  I read the reviews both positive and negative and decided for short term to just text call and email this phone would be OK.  It wasn't OK.  Not even close to OK.  In addition to all the other negatives from other reviews I will add that the antenna on this phone is REALLY REALLY weak.  I never could make a phone call because at best I had 1 bar and the call didn't go through.  I never managed to get a text through but I did get the email to work.  Unfortunately I could only send emails if I was sitting within 5 feet of the router.  Oh yeah there is the battery life.  There isn't any.  OK I'm exaggerating.  If you don't use it it has a day or two.  If you forget to turn off Wi Fi you've got a couple hours.
