Best little laptop I ever bought. I work in a school and commute. Does the job without weighing several pounds that I would need to lug around. Battery life is almost the entire school day being used constantly. That part was just an added bonus in my eyes. Does office and streaming not gaming. I didn't buy it to game on.
