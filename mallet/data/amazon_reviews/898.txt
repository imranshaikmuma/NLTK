I am absolutely loving this phone. I have researched BLU products for well over 6 months and fell in love with their sleek design.  This phone has been amazing. It came in yesterday. I put all of my apps on it and I still have a ton of space. Also it is thin and sleek.  I love the gold color. I wish it had more case options. It is so new (released Jan 2017) that there aren't many (hardly any) cases available.  But that does not matter. The phone itself is great.  It came with chargers a case (not a big deal case but it is good for now) screen protector earbuds connector cord for other media.  It is great.  The phone is fast. The camera's are great.  I am just very pleased.
