I think this smart watch is very good for people who do not have a lot of money and want a smart watch that is functional loud and easy to use. This watch has auto loss which works and the Bluetooth range is pretty good. It has 3 watch faces (all analog) but when you swipe up to unlock you see a digital watch. Most of the features require a SIM card or Micro SD card to use though. The notifications only work on android but if you know your notification tones then it'll play through the Watch Bluetooth audio. The sleep tracker and step tracker works and the alarm which wakes you up easily. The calling is a pain because on the home menu the call for Bluetooth is there but in the menu screens it makes you use a SIM card. The messaging doesn't work and you can't text people but Hey Siri works by saying it to the watch. People understood me clearly when I talk to them via watch microphone. I recommend this watch to people who want one to use for phone and fitness but nothing more
