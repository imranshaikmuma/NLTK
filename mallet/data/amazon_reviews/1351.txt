The item was as pictured in the ad but was even more beautiful when I received it. I think the jewelry was well made and looks wonderful. I brought it as a gift for my wife for no special reason and she loves it. I think for the price it was well worth buying. It came on time and well wrapped in a nice gift box. Everything was great and glad I purchased the item.
