I had been looking for a pair of jeans that would be appropriate for a 45+year old woman.  These fit the bill beautifully!!!I have donated more pants over the last year than I care to think about.  Why?  Because most of today's women's casual pants are low riders.  I wanted a pair of pants that fit at the waist and these do.  They are incredibly durable and comfortable.  The supplier was prompt in delivery.  I was so happy with these jeans I ordered another pair.  My only wish is that they came in a khaki shade. I opted for black.  They wash and hang out beautifully.  I highly recommend this product.
