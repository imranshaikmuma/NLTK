My husband is a Sous Chef and he needed some new shoes. He just wanted a pair of crocs to hold him over until he could buy something better these definitely fit the bill.He really likes these shoes and they seems to hold up well to working 12-15 hour shifts on his feet all day long.The only downside (he has said) is that his feet sweat really bad in the crocs (he wears moisture wicking socks too) and since there's no fabric on Crocs there isn't anywhere for the moisture to go. His feet just stay really wet. That's the only downside... I haven't found a solution to that problem yet and I probably won't find one.
