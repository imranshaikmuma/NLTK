This Kodak AZ251 digital camera is exactly as described!  Even though there is only 1 picture to go by in the description this camera is beautiful all over!!  I have included 5 angles I took with my cell phone to show how pretty the camera is!  I took 4 pictures of day shots with the camera 2 with flash and 2 without.  I also took one picture in our bathroom in the dark that is the one with fish.  As you can see the flash works wonderfully!!  The only complaint I have is the lens cover cap is a little loose and falls off easily. I will be adding a thin layer of foam to make it more secure.  Otherwise I am totally happy with the camera!!  This darling little digital camera totally lives up to the Kodak name!
