I was looking for a reasonably priced camera to take underwater pictures. It camera was a very good choice. I took fantastic pictures. It was a little hard to figure out but once I did it was great. the colors is very lifelike and the pictures are very sharp. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to take great pictures and video.
