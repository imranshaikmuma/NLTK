So far so good! I got a decent deal on this due to the lightning sale. I bought a few upgrades like the Kingston 16gb DDR4 RAM and Samsung Evo 850 500 GB SSD. After installation this thing is running like a champ. I had a few issues though with the upgrades. The most problematic was migrating the Windows 10 OS to the SSD. The Samsung migration software did not work for me and I spent countless hours trying to fix it. I was getting a continuous loop boot on start up and thought that I had bricked my brand new laptop. Long story short I had to restore it and use a 3rd party migration software from Paragon to put the OS into the SSD. Now its super fast on start up and works flawlessly.Update 12/15/16: Still works great. Using my Xbox one controller to play games. Im sold and converted to pc gaming. No more consoles for me as I'm researching into building a desktop gaming rig. I'll still use this laptop for school and gaming.
