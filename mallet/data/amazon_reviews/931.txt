Works well and very capable. Having some nitpicky issues getting used to Android again after spending a few years using iPhones and Windows - I mainly miss the seamless voice control integration with the car that I had on Windows phone (that's the one thing Windows phones do better than anything else - with no special hardware or software required). Feel free to share a good Android car solution. The fingerprint sensor is too easy to mistake for a home button - would be nice if it could be re-mapped. This phone is a little bigger in real life than I expected - takes some getting used to if you're coming from a smaller device. But these issue are minor. The camera is fantastic the mods are maybe a little gimmicky but I think they have a lot of potential (I got the Hasselblad mod at a great Black Friday price though the phone's built-in camera is arguably superior in a few ways). Performance on games and videos is great. Integration with Google Drive is so smooth with a good connection that it's almost like local storage.  Battery life is awesome and the turbo charger is impressive.
