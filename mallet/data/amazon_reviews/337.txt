I am an amateur photographer and prefer taking pictures of wildlife which includes insects and birds. The zoom on this camera allows me to get closer than I've ever gotten before! I have purchased many cameras on-line but most of them are returned because of the difficulty of using them...that is not true with this camera. I have had many Lumix cameras before and the only reason I upgrade is because they keep improving the range of the zoom. They serve well translate color well and are easy to operate.
