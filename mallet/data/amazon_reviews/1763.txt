I needed more durable shirts dress shirts for work. I'm required to wear a dress shirt to work and my $70 Express shirts are amazing but the dry cleaning bill was adding up. I can just throw these dickies in the wash no problem.  I needed to look professional but still be able to do manual labor at times in a nice dress shirt which makes no sense. So far these are great. My only minor complaint is that the pockets are too low it seems so it appears I'm wearing a shirt thats much bigger when tucked in my pants. The pockets are really good size.
