I'm a long time Canon owner/user the SL-1 is my fourth digital Rebel.  I had a T3i that I purchased a year ago and I loved that camera.  When I saw the SL1 I was intrigued so I ordered it.  Very happy with the SL1 gives up nothing to the T3 except that the LCD screen is fixed not swiveling but I didn't use the swivel feature anyway and the SL1 adds a very capable touchscreen that really works.  I love the small size paired with a smaller kit lens (I have the 18-55USM IS that came with the T3i which is a bit smaller than the current STM lens they package these cameras with today) it is a VERY portable and light full featured DSLR. I also have the 15-85mm 10-22mm and 55-250 canon zooms all terrific lenses in their own right (particularly the 15-85 GREAT all around lens).  Those lenses add weight and bulk but the smaller camera body size still helps and you can always put the kit lens on when you want the light/compact camera to carry around.Image quality is superb acceptable noise on images I shot the other night in a dimly lit coffee house @ 3200 ISO.Best camera I've owned.  I did a lot of research to see if I could justify an upgrade to a Canon 6D or 5D but the price penalty (thousands for new camera bodies and lenses) and the weight and bulk penalty (considerable) didn't justify what I consider to be marginal improvements in image quality at least for my needs which are partly professional (I used this camera quite a bit for work) and for my own personal photography.So take the plunge my guess is 90% of you will love this camera.  The camera feels higher quality to me than the T3i nicer cosmetics slightly higher quality plastics used.
