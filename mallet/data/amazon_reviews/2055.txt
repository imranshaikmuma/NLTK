I've had many laptops and convertible tablets and I'm very impressed by this one. It's very lightweight - even lighter than the Surface Pro 4 with keyboard. The keyboard feels nice better than the Dell XPS-13 in my opinion. The SSD is easily upgradable - all the screws holding the bottom cover in place are exposed (i.e. not covered by rubber feet) and there are no pesky plastic lips to undo (well a few towards the back but those are easy to undo).I've always been an advocate for high resolution screens but at this screen size I think FHD is perfectly sufficient.It has a standard size SD card slot! This is great for avid photographers it's one fewer accessory to carry around.My only complaint is a proprietary AC adapter with a bulky power cable - USB-C power would have been nice.
