I've been a faithful Superfeet user for many years. I use them in all my shoes - dress causal and running. Because I run ultra-marathons they take punishment beyond what a normal athlete would be able to dole out (see picture). Despite the thin-looking appearance they have served me much better than any custom insole ever has (and I've had several!). For me I found that the arch support is just enough. It takes a couple minutes to cut each one to size but all you have to do is take out the manufacturer's insert and trace around it...not rocket science :-)
