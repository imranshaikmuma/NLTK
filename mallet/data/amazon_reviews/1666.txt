This jacket fits me perfectly. I bought this jacket as a replacement to a Carhartt J130 size Large because the large seemed to allow too much air in underneath the jacket around my waist.  This time I got the Medium tall and that seems to be the ideal fit for me. The large didn't fit me as snugly as I wanted and I didn't want to have to wear a bunch of bulky clothes underneath it. I am 6'0" 150 lbs so this jacket will serve me well and I really like the material. It keeps the wind out and you can wear layers underneath it. They seem to run a bit on the larger size in sizing I think. I like the medium tall because it comes around my pockets which keeps the wind from whipping up my back or my sides when I am walking outside and keeps the jacket from slipping up when I am working outside in the cold. The winters in Nebraska are pretty chilly at times with highs in the teens and the snow will stay on the ground for months at a time so this is definitely a great jacket for the price and durability. The material is the highest quality and really keeps out the wind so that's what I love about Carhartt jackets. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
