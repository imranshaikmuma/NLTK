1 Month Review: This laptop is the perfect $600 (after taxes) laptop! It's specs are unheard of at this price range - 2.3Ghz + 2.8Ghz Turbo Boost Intel Core i5 Dual Core 6200u 8gb DDR4 RAM 256gb SSD NVIDIA GeForce 940MX w/ 2gb Dedicated GDDR5 RAM packaged with Windows 10!? If you have the money and want a gaming laptop buy this! It can run games like WarFrame Rocket League The Sims 4 and more at Ultra settings and other popular titles such as GTA V Black Ops III at decent FPS and graphics. It's 1080p Display is also a nice touch at this price point. The webcam is very average at 720p but that's definitely no problem. Battery life is great when you aren't playing a game but when you are you should carry the charger with you so it doesn't turn off mid-game. The touchpad feels a little iffy but it's easy to get used to and mouses are cheap. The keyboard feels nice and is backlit no complaints there. You can easily add a hard drive if the 256gb SSD is too little for you. It doesn't feel super premium but as long as you don't drop it all the time it'll last for sure.Quick Review:PROS:- AMAZING specs for the price.- Great display and keyboard- Can run AAA titles at decent settings and most other games at Ultra settings.- Not too heavy easy to transport.- Boots up very quickly and opens programs very quickly thanks to its SSD.- Comes with Windows 10.CONS: (none of these are too relevant buy this laptop!)- Soft webcam- Touchpad isn't great
