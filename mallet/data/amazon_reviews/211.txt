I'm a photo enthusiast not a pro. Like others have said this camera is truly the Jack of all Trades. It does everything well. This is the first time that I upgraded to Full Frame. Coming from the 7d I liked its performance and image quality at low ISO. But as the 7d gets above 3200 or 6400 I would have to do more post processing images were too grainy and lost a lot of details. In certain cases images were unusable. But with this 5D3 not afraid to use High ISO. I was at a wedding shot around 500 photos and they came out great. Some photos I didn't have too much post processing at all.1. Image Quality - excellent sharp more natural colors2. AutoFocus - lots of points fast Spot-On focus3. High ISO performance - excellent less noise I was able to use photos shot 6400 and above. Less post processing time4. Performance - 6 fps5. Brings out the best in my cheap lens!6. Dual Card slots7. Price - @$2700...Yes worth it!For those considering 5D3 or debating between 6d and 5D3 I would say get this camera. The 6d just doesn't have some of the important features that 5D3 have which could come in handy in the future and I think it's worth the extra $$. Hopes this helps out others who are deciding.
