So I was dragged to this lularoe party and felt obligated to buy a pair of those way overpriced leggings. These are the exact same if not better! Super soft and seem a lot better quality!  It does say hand wash and hang dry. However I washed and ddried them in the washer and dryer to do a deep clean before wear and they came out perfect. Can't beat the price and quality
