When looking for a new laptop I wanted something with enough hardware to efficiently write/run computer programs and enough battery to let me work away from a wall plug. This computer does that easily. As an added bonus it also runs all the video games I own without freezing getting hot or running the fan so loud it dominates the noise in the room (not to say the fan doesn't run or it can't be heard but it's quiet enough to not be an issue for me).Pros:Nice sized solid state driveOne of the best graphics cards at this price pointBattery can make it through several hours of work related activities (haven't tested long sessions of video games on the battery).Keyboard has a nice feel. My last laptop had very little drop for each key. This ASUS is lovely to type on.Does not get hot at least while I'm working and for the non-intensive games I play (think Mount and Blade: Warband)Cons:Track pad is sometimes frustrating missing clicks or minor jerks. I use a USB mouse instead.Volume control on the keyboard requires 2 hands (fn key + F10-F12)
