This is the type and style of T-shirt that fits the bill for me. The fabric  is a medium weight and the stitching is well fabricated. As many others have stated it fits larger than the norm in sizing. I personally like tees that have a little extra room so the sizing is not a problem for me. It has extra length which for me is great. I want a tee to stay tucked in and this one certainly does that. Though it runs large the neck sizing fits comfortably without being baggy. Sleeve length is on the long side but like the collar the cuffs fits snug without  being binding. I ordered the forest green and the color was spot on with the advertised color. One thing that is a downside for me though is where it is manufactured. I always prefer my purchase to be made in the USA but clothing seldom is. This tee was manufactured in Honduras.
