UPDATE 12/21/16Battery drained quickly. Charger it came with quit working after 2 weeks so had to replace. It froze up a couple times a day. I purchased this phone in September. Used it for 2months. One day the phone did a software update and since then it doesn't work I power it off pulled the battery charged it and every time it powers up the screen flashes to an error message that I'm supposed to click something to correct it yet I am never able to actually click it because it keeps flashing on and off the screen so quickly it's ridiculous... 2 months this phone worked out for me. Not impressed.Using for just under a week now. I have always used Straight Talk literally all I had to do was put my straight talk simcard in this phone and that was it. I like it. Nice display nice photo quality nice phone calling and texting. At this point I have no complaints.
