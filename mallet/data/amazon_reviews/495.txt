This camera takes amazingly high quality photos for the price.We purchased this for my mother who travels a lot and back then had refused to get a smart phone so she took all photos with her film camera (yes in 2014/2015). We tried out every camera we could find in our $300 or less price range at Best Buy CostCo Fryes etc. and read as many reviews as we could but this camera was BY FAR the best quality.  Once we started taking photos this camera blew the rest away.My mother now is using her iPad and smart phone to take photos but I still have to remind her that this camera is far better to use for travel. I may steal it from her if she stops using it it is that good. After all sometimes you may want to blow up your photo snapshots and this is a great camera for that purpose.
