Returned due to odd *zzzzzttttt* noise coming from underneath in the back of the laptop. . Barely audible at first but continued to get louder. Customer support thought maybe hardware issue. I loved this laptop. Structurally AWSOME. Matte screen was great. Viewing angles were really good. I did not want to return. Even with the issue I had I would still recommend this laptop.
