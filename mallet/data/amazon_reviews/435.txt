Still learning the camera operation but so far it's easy to use.  But there is an awful lot to learn.  A hardcopy of the manual would be helpful.  Fully expect this would be 5 stars once I become proficient in it's operation.  Only complaint so far while shooting it's very easy to 'bump' a button on the back and change a setting especially if wearing gloves.  Maybe there's a way to disable these buttons but I have not found it so far.  Otherwise a very good deal especially for the price.
