I didn't really need a 2nd laptop. I bought this Chromebook more out of curiosity than any urgent need.I wanted to see how different it was from my Win7 laptop. Great decision!Can't beat the price for the features.Fast startup compared to any Windows machine I've ever used.Long battery life - I've had it on for as much as 9hrsVery lightweight. I take this everywhere because it just doesn't seem to weigh anything. This is similar to a MacBook Air in weight.The learning curve for this Chromebook is very shallow. I had a friend that visited and who knows nothing about computers and is a MacBook user.The friend needed a computer for an emergency. She just opened up this Chromebook and went to work for a few hours and never asked for any help. To me this was strong validation that the Chromebook concept is great for most computer needs.I also watch a ton of online TV shows. The sites I use for TV shows from all over the world unfortunately have lots of popup ads and try often to hijack my browsers so virus protections must be up to date and VPNs turned on when I use a Windows computer. This chromebook is so much more secure-  it has become my primary media device. I simply added the extensions - Ad Blocker Pro and Tunnelbear VPN and I'm safe. So is my home network!!I love that friends and family who have gmail accounts can use my chromebook as if it were their own but never have access to my info.All-in-all this Chromebook is a perfect 2nd computer and on it's own can do 90% of everything you want a computer to do...and 100% of what I spend most of my time doing with a computer- web surfing media watching emailing and social media. When I bought this Acer 14  Google provided 2-yrs of complimentary 100GB online storage for Google's Drive
