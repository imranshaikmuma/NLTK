Update 11/17/16: As of 11/17/16 this model supports installing most Android apps. You have to enable the Developer Channel in the Chromebook Settings and reboot. Then you will have the Play Store in the taskbar.Original Review:It has been a while since I last used a Chromebook.  Chromebooks have some advantages.  Fast boot times is one of them.  Freedom from worrying about viruses is another.When I saw the Google Play Store was coming to Chromebooks I decided to pick one up again.  This particular model is on the list of Chromebooks that will be eventually getting the Play Store.I chose this one because it had 4 Gb of RAM.  Surely double the RAM over other Chromebooks will always be useful especially when running Android apps.The screen is crisp enough from typing distance.  Its generally on par with all other Chromebooks.Typing on a Chromebook has proven to be something I need to get used to.  The keys are big enough and spaced well enough but there's a cramped feeling when typing and soreness too.  I find myself making a lot more typing errors.  This doesn't feel like a full-size keyboard.The trackpad supports two finger scrolling and right clicking by using a two finger click.The build quality is great.  There's no flex in the keyboard and no flex in the chassis either.  It is solid.  I wish Samsung would have opted to use micro-usb charging instead of the proprietary barrel style charger.  The charging cable is short but since Chromebooks deliver hours and hours of battery life you won't be tied to a wall outlet all the time.Overall I like this Chromebook.  There are  lot of similarly priced Chromebooks out there.  After some research I chose this one.
