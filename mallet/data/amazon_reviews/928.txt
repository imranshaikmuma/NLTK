I had a Moto X Pure I got the Z Play because I liked my previous phone and heard good things about the battery.  This phone has no lag is very clear and the Moto ware is the only thing that isn't stock Android. The Moto ware makes OK Google even better and also makes your phone do cool things like turn on the "flashlight" with a karate chop.  It is stable it has a 5in screen which fits in my hand much better that the slightly larger X Pure with no noticeable difference in size or quality.  This is the phone of the year.  Samsungs are catching on fire LGs are boot looping and Apple is still Apple.  This phone gives me 24 to 48 hours of life on one charge  with moderate to heavy use. Buy this phone
