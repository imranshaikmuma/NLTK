First photo is with SonySecond photo is with New Canon SX 520 HS $89 (16 megapixel)Third photo is with old Canon Powershot SD 100 (7.1 megapixel)  my dog moved during the third photoI usually only purchase items after reading multiple reviews. I was tricked by the amount of good vs. poor reviews on this camera. Even though the specs are pretty good 20.1 megapixel optical zoom etc the pictures produced were less than ideal. It was far inferior to the pictures taken with my Canon Powershot purchased 10 years ago. That camera had much "lower" specs. Without the flash the pictures are extremely blurry. With the blinding flash (which I was afraid would cause my 1 yr old niece retinal damage so I decided to stop taking pictures during her birthday party :( ) the pictures were only slightly better.  I even tried taking pictures outside when it was bright and sunny but that still did not help with my picture quality. I'm not a photography expert or anything which is why I rely on specs and online reviews. All I want is a point and shoot camera that worked maybe slightly better than my old camera. I should have checked other review website before deciding to purchase this camera. I regret purchasing this $89 paperweight.  I tried returning this product or trading it in. Apparently no website including Amazon trade in will accept this product. I know why. Ugh.
