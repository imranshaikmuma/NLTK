I have purchased many of these Blu Phones. My first impression was that it was a Chinese brand so I noticed it on the Microsoft Store and contacted Microsoft nearly shaming them on the phone for selling this new brand I had not heard about.I then contacted Blu in Florida and in talking to them I learned that they are a USA company manufacturing in Brazil and other locations with Asian custom made parts. Ok it's worth a try.Impressed with features pricing and Customer Service.Now regarding this BLU Studio X8 HD it's camera is very very good the weight is very very good. Pricing you can't beat it for a dual sim phone Octa processor that's very fast and the HD features are also very much welcomed. Plenty of Battery capacity for this phone and works well in all regards.Summary: I will be buying more of these.Normally I buy iphones Samsung Motorola Kyocera Google Phones and others. Blu rates with the others mentioned here they all have advantages and some disadvantages we can all live with or without.
