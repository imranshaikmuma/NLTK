These Carhartts are top notch ... very comfortable  looks sharp and well made.Actually better than a 5-star rating in my book.Why?1. Fit is spot on and very comfortable. I typically wear a 33/30 however Carhartts run somewhat small and the 34/30's I got fit just as I expected - like a 33.2. Well constructed... triple stitched in the areas that count and an overall sturdy feel3. Looks sharp ... got these in black and the overall style / cut of these pants looks great.4. Versatile ... these are easily everyday / any occasion  pants (especially in black). Wear them to work the office with a tee shirt or even as casual dress pants. They really fit the bill whether it's laid back attire or somewhat dressed up.5. It's not easy finding a good pair of reasonably priced black pants that is not a lint magnet ... these Carhartts are great in this regard no lint magnet.Overall a great pair of pants. .. will buy again. Thumbs up Carhartt!
