I actually returned this coat so this is only a review on the fit and not a commentary on durability or warmth. I wear a 3XL tall in shirts and a 4X regular will often also work for clothing that runs small. Since this would be going over my clothes I ordered the 4XL regular. The "girth" of the coat was perfect for the size but the coat was on the rather short side. If I were to raise my arms or attempt to bend over I would definitely be showing my mid-section or my back side. For a coat that I bought for some extra warmth this wasn't a good trait. The sleeves also seem a bit long for the size but I could've lived with that. All in all it seems like it would've been the perfect coat for warmth and durability but the short fit is what made me return it to exchange for another style Carhartt jacket in 4XLT size.
