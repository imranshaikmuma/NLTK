Amazing laptop at the best price!! this laptop not only comes with the 7th Generation i5 Processor but it ALSO includes a Nvidia Graphics Card. Yes it is only a 940MX but at this $550 price range we usually don't get anything else besides an Intel Graphics card so this is a huge bonus. This system is also easily upgradable you can have up to 32gb of RAM (16gb should be plenty though) and you can also add an HDD Drive if needed. It is easily accessible by removing the back lid with only 3 screws. You would also get a 256gb M.2 drive which is blazing fast. My system turns on and starts up Google Chrome in less than 16 seconds and that is impressive. You would also get the latest 3.0 USBs and 2.0 USB ports with the newer Type-C connector and of course an HDMI port. There is really nothing else to ask for in this laptop. It comes with a lot of features for an extremely low price. I ended up buying 2 of these laptops since i saw how quick they are selling out. Oh and lets not forget the extremely long battery life this laptop comes with out of the box with max brightness i was able to get around 8 hours of life.
