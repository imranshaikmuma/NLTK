This cute little phone is great! I took it to Europe and used it in France for a week- everything worked out fine. I bought a SIM card when I got there for about 20 euros which allowed me unlimited texting/calling for 10 days! This allowed me to be in contact with my French friends easily and so I felt safe having it as I was often exploring the city on my own. I even dropped the phone once on a hard floor and it was fine. When you put the SIM card in it is normal for it to speak to you in its own language (in my case French)- this is not the phone's "fault" it's programmed into the card- you can indeed change the language. Some people complained about the difficulty opening the back cover and also inserting a SIM card- to me neither was really a problem. To pop the back case off I just used my two thumb nails to pry it open... you could probably use a letter opener or something like that if your fingers are too big. To put the case back on do remember to put in the two little bottom prongs first or it will snap into place without being all the way on. For the SIM card it was indeed helpful to have small fingers to place it in its slot... I guess you could use tweezers if needed. Also remember that the bottom slot is like a drawer which you need to pull out in order to put in the SIM card. It did take me a little while to get used to the phone and to figure out what the symbols meant; like some people said the directions aren't too helpful- but honestly it was pretty self-explanatory especially if you're used to non-Smartphones (like me!). The online guide another reviewer mentioned was helpful as well so print that out and take it with you. All in all I was really happy with this phone and look forward to taking it with me on another adventure!
