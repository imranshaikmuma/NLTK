I love these shoes! I am hard to please as well due to planters factitious fallen arches and lots of screws in my ankle. Great arch support and really beautifully designed shoe. The photo doesn't do them justice. They make me happy looking at them and wearing them. I only wear them to work out and they feel great! Great price too!!
