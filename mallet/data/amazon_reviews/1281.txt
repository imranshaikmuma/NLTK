I'm 5'11" and pretty thick in the hips/tummy/butt. It's so hard to find yoga pants that fit well especially in length and not being see-through in the butt. After reading the reviews I decided it wouldn't hurt to try so I ordered a L and it arrived a week later. Like most I was concerned about how small they looked right out of the package. But the material seemed sturdy and they ended up slipping on like a glove. They are perfect in length and fit well! Flattering shape and perfect breathable material. There's still a bit of transparency in the back side but that's something I'll have to deal with forever longer tank tops and dark thongs help make it less obvious if not indecipherable. The "fold over"  part is really short in my opinion and they make them a little too low cut in the back to be comfortable so I just keep it folded up and wear them like higher wasted pants. I'm not sure how they will hold up after a few washes but for the price I'd rate 5 stars. They remind me of a pair of yoga pants I bought years ago that I spent almost $50 on! Definitely recommend I will be buying more.
