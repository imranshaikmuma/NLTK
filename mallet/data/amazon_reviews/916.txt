I like this phone.  My regular cell is an iPhone.  I got this as an international travel phone because it is cheap simple unlocked and dual SIM and has a long battery life.  It takes full size SIM cards.  Inserting the SIM cards isn't immediately obvious.  The instructions are useless. I figured it out by carefully studying a little icon impressed into the plastic above the battery compartment.  Taking the cover off to get to the SIM cards is a little bit of a pain to take off and put back on again.  You'll need a microSD card if you want to take pictures.  I previously had the Tank T190 and liked it.  This is an incremental improvement except for getting to the SIM cards.  If you are going to frequently change SIM cards I wouldn't recommend this phone.  Otherwise this make a great little travel phone or backup phone.
