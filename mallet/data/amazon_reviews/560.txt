I wanted a waterproof camera to use on a vacation to Mexico. We knew we would snorkel and such so I wanted something cheaper we could use for that.This camera turned out to be awesome for us. It is exactly what it says. We took many pictures above and below the water with this and nearly all turned out great.Understanding a cameras limits on power we did purchase lithium batteries for it as designed. We took 160 pictures (all in high sunlight so no flash was used) but we still had 3/4 left on the batteries. I never changed them out on our 10 day trip and still have plenty left.Â I have no problem opening the door i just read the instructions. push the lock while sliding. Opened right up and we were set.All in all please let me say this this camera took our 10th anniversary pictures and these were the best of the bunch because we took them in and on the water where we could not take our other camera and you cant tell the difference between the two when we look at them on the PC.
