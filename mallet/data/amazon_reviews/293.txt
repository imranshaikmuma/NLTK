i'm not a professional.  i love photography and have had many cameras.  started with nikon switched to canon.  last 2 cameras are pentax.  buying a camera is a big deal to me i do not have money to burn.  decided on the k70 and i could not be happier.  the camera is pretty intuitive first time out of the box it felt like an old friend in my hands.  i will not get into features you can read that for yourself.  but i will say if you want to put it on auto or play around with the settings there are enough bells and whistles to keep you happy. feels like quality in your hands. only negatives and it's not really that big of a deal no usb cord full manual is on pdf form on line.
