For a shoe with "gel" in its name I was expecting these sneakers to have a cushy gel insole or padding & be comfortable to walk in. Instead there is no gel anything about these. The insole is extremely thin with no support or spring back. I could not wear them until I purchased a different GEL insole. The tread is so hard that it grips on smooth concrete floors causing me to stumble/trip if I stop too suddenly at work. The only positive thing I can say about these is that the ankle area has extra padding and that is at least comfy. Will not purchase ASICS ever again.
