Pros -lightweight very good battery life decent sound overall fast performanceCons - really noticeable backlight bleeding phenomenon both at left upper and right lower parts of the screen -perhaps not big deal for those who mostly use this laptop for office applications but if you work with dark screen or watch movies it may become really annoying.I am thinking about return as I find this level of quality below acceptable. It seem to be a known problem of Zenbooks of previous generation which ASUS did not bother to fix. If not monitor bleed I would call this laptop close to perfect ( addition of backlit keyboard would be big plus)
