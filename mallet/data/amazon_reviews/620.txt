I got my B700 3 days ago. So far I'm extremely impressed. I bought this camera (to replace my Canon powershot sx50 hs) with 2 criteria in mind: Ergonomics and raw/high res. pics. The ergonomics work perfect for me. I can hold the camera with one hand when using the viewfinder without inadvertently activating various functions which invariably happened with the Canon.Shooting raw produces 30 MB files and when converted are about 10 MB jpg with the Nikon  progs or 15-18 MB with Photoshop. The detail and clarity is amazing!Couple of other points which might be useful for some: The lens thread is 52 mm for mounting filters/hood and pinpoint focus can be found in the scene/bird-watching mode
