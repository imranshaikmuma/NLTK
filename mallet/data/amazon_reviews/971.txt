I have been waiting for years for the inevitable moment when my continual exposure to the microwave radiation emanated by cell phones will give me super powers.Sadly that moment has not come.HOWEVERI live in a somewhat remote area. My Samsung Galaxy S5 would frequently lose signal along my road and I would get a bar or possibly two while at my house. I had the same problem with the Galaxy S4. Ever since I have purchased the Motorola G4 plus I haven't lost signal once and I have almost full bars everywhere in my service area.I did some pretty exhaustive research on unlocked phones and which models would have the strongest antennas and radios. As was my experience back in the pre Android days Motorola makes a solid device and I can see that this trend has continued. I am very pleased with the UI and the general features of the phone but I have to say that as a person who has had a difficult time holding a conversation from his house this phone is a godsend.The absolutely cavernous onboard storage and big fat chunk of memory (4GB; double the normal 2GB)  made it an easy choice over the Nexus phones. The fact that I was able to bring my phone up to 128 gigabytes with the addition of a 64 gigabyte SD card was just icing on the cake.The only real detractor is that now I can't ignore my boss's phone calls and claimed I didn't have signal. So....yeah.
