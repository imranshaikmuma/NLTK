I am older and not very computer savvy. I had only used Windows and had a HP computer. I had someone recommend the MacBook saying how much they loved it. I was afraid that I would have a hard time trying to figure out how to use it since it is such a different configuration than Windows. Well I decided to take the plunge and boy I am so glad I did. It took a couple of days but it was not as hard as I thought it would be. I had to use Apple Care one time because I couldn't find files/photos that I had transferred from my old computer (told you I wasn't very savvy) anyway the lady I talked to was so kind and helped to walk me through what I needed to do to find them. I highly recommend you getting one if you are on the fence. It is so lightening fast and the touch pad is great. I had still used the mouse with the HP but it is so easy on this Mac that I don't use it anymore.Hope this helps someone.
