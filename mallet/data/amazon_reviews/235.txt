The camera is all I wanted it to be and even more....however having said that due to problems with SnapBridge I have knocked the whole package back to 3 stars. Nikon needs to refine how SnapBridge is paired with the camera or iPhone or iPad. On several occasions the same photograph was transmitted from the D5600 over 300 times to my 7 Plus iPhone. What a hassle having to delete over 300 of the same photograph. Thinking the my iPhone 7 Plus was the problem I then paired the D5600 with my iPad and got the same results with another photograph...over 300 times. I will say 99 % of the photographs I took paired perfectly but it's that one percent that created major problems for me. This is obviously some sort of software glitch. Has anyone else experienced this same problem....it is absolutely driving me nuts.  Help!!!!
