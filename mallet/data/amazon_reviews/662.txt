This phone is a unbelievable value.  I've had all Iphone products Samsung Nexus 6 etc and this phone is not them.  However this phone resets the bar on what the others should be.  Will this phone do 99% of what just about every user demands?  Dual sims work flawlessly runs all the apps in the PlayStore.  You won't be able to just install everything your hearts desire you'll have to manage storage memory.  There is a slot for a up to a 64 gb card for media and apps that allow you to move them to the SD card but you'll see that few apps can be moved to SD card anymore (not the phone's fault).  The screen is not HD or Retna but it's 100% acceptable.  Good viewing angles clear bright etc.  I've had phones that had poor displays and you couldn't see the screen if you tilted the phone this is not the case with this phone.  Battery life is really really good.  I run dual sims (work/personal) and I'm 60% when I go to bed.  Build quality is much better than I expected very solid.  Call volume is a bit low but this seems to be a common issue with Android not the hardware.For $60 you will not be disappointed.  You'll probably wonder what an extra $600 for a high end phone really gives you.My family member also has a Blu phone different model and it's been 100% for 1.5 years.  She loves it and laughs when she tells people she paid less than $100 for it.
