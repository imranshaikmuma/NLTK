Update January 2016 - We completed the new house and moved in. This time lapse camera captured the entire process! I am busy editing out the extraneous segments to produce a short beginning-to-end video for us.  Now that the house has been built I plan to use the camera to capture various landscaping projects and also as a security camera (bought the motion-sensor accessory). Well worth the money.Original review:Great product we are using it to record the construction of our new house.  Very easy to use we highly recommend this.Each week I download the daily videos and a compile them into a single video. I especially like the fact that you can set a start / stop time per day and that you can adjust the time interval between images. I didn't want to waste a lot of shots on night shots when there is nothing to record. I now have the camera set to take one shot every 15 minutes from 7:30 am to 6:00 pm.Once the house project is complete I plan to re-use the camera as a security camera. Double duty!
