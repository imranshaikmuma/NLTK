We've purchased many of the Core i5 version of this laptop with SSD & nVidia graphics for our customers and they are very happy. This Core i3 version with regular 1TB HDD & Intel graphics has the same build quality as the higher performance versions but at a substantially lower price. If you don't need quad cores or discrete graphics but want the fast boot times of an SSD you can buy a regular 2.5" SSD and replace the mechanical drive OR you can buy an M.2 SATA III SSD (Not NVMe compatible) and have two drives one for fast boot and programs the other for file storage & backup. I recommend the Crucial MX300 www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IAGSDJ0. Also apparently they are shipping these laptops WITH the M.2 mounting screw (see attached photos) so you don't have to purchase or jury rig anything! (Careful installing the M.2 SSD as it plugs in only one way)
