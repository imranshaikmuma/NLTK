Had to have them hemmed up by a full inch +. This is in spite of having multiple pairs of the same model and style for many years  which all fit perfectly. This leads me to believe that they changed the dimensions of the style over the years but did not change the actual measurements. Regardless it is only a minor complaint that I had to pay $10 per pair to have them fit as perfectly as previous pairs... but still I had to pay $10 for the same model and style same measurements and same ID number for pants that I never previously had a problem with.These pants are excellent for people don't want to dress in pedestrian and plebeian bleu jeans but dont want to appear pompous and conceited as they would with more professional looking slacks. A perfect blend of classy functional sophistication and comfortable.
