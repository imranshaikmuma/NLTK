Very nice pant light weight for summer very well made.  I am 5 ' 6" and about 125 - 130 lbs.  I ordered a medium in black and a large in Navy blue.Unfortunately both were way too big on me.  The inseam appears to be geared for a taller person.  I would suggest anyone my height and weight might want to try XS or SM.  Other wise I really liked the scrubs and hope to reorder and try the XS.
