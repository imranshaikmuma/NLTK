Disappointed. These are really inconsistent for how expensive they are. Not worth the money. I've toughed it out for a few weeks with these as replacements in my nice Thorogood mock toe workboots thinking maybe they would break in and start feeling more comfortable but they haven't. They fit perfectly inside the boots. However the arch support on the left footbed feels like it's way too far back on my heel without enough room in the heel area. The right one feels like it fits right but still isn't very comfortable. They're hard and uncomfortable. I have a high arch and it looks like these should fit my feet just right and feel good but they're just super uncomfortable in all the wrong places. The quality of the materials isn't anything special I can't believe they charge this much for something that must be super cheap to manufacture and that seems to have poor quality control.
