I love everything about these scrubs! The fit color and style are just what I was looking for. I don't understand how people are eating them out of the dryer wrinkle free and all. I fried mine and immediately pulled them out and they are wrinkled worse than when I first opened them! It's a wavy kind of wrinkle pattern that is all over and will definitely need ironing! Is there some secret to it?! This is the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.
