i work 9 hours m-f in these and they are the most comfortable scrub pants yet! the stretch is so comfortable and the material is light weight and cool. another thing i like about these is that they are very forgiving when spilled on and do not absorb stains like regular cotton scrubs do. these fit true to size and are the perfect length on my 5'6 frame!
