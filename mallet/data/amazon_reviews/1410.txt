I switched to Fruit of the Loom because Hanes flat out told me they stopped making white boxers/boxer briefs. This is not because all consumers are idiots; it's not always the consumer's fault or because of demand.To a lot of us white boxers are classy clean. However when you manufacture white or lighter colors you have to use more expensive material. You will notice that black boxers only contain 75% cotton whereas whites and greys contain 100%. Thus it is cheaper to make more colors and patterns.... even though colors and patterns are for kids in my opinion. Unfortunately consumers will buy anything because they are in a bind they have no choice. I'm grateful black and grey are available in case white goes away completely some day.  Can't imagine wearing red or plaid underwear.  More expensive underwear companies always provide white boxersetc....they know class.  Hopefully Fruit of the Loom continues to make white underwear.
