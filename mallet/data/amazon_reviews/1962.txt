Spent 14 hours researching what computer I was going to buy before I stumbled upon this one. I think it is the perfect balance between the power and value that you really want from a computer. It really seems to have all of the most basic features you really would like to have in a computer: 4 processing threads running at a decent speed an SSD of decent size for fast boot times sufficient memory (4GB generally works but this has 8GB)  a DVD burner a full HD screen a 12 hour battery life (haven't tested that yet but it seems likely to approach that if you put it in the "battery saver" mode multiple USB3 ports bluetooth a LAN adapter both VGA and HDMI connectors that support multiple monitors and what I consider to be very nice extra bonuses include a backlit keyboard and a decent nVidia graphics chip embedded. The only thing this computer is missing that higher end computers have these days is a touch screen display (but who cares? I don't like finger prints on my screen anyway...) and a lot of hard disk space. For an extra $30 bucks though you can buy a fairly fast 128GB USB 3.0 thumb drive that increases the size of your drive to something that would last you a year or two before you run of space or you could just use cloud storage (slow) or buy a micro SD card and use that (medium)  or buy an external drive (medium) for storing all your videos and music. Connect to it over the network even.Anyway the point is I'm really happy with this computer so far. I have only had it for a few days but I've tested it under some heavy programs and it seems to be running smoothly. I also recognize that Acer products often have some bad reviews and in the past I have tended to avoid them but I really think they did a great job with this one.  A++ Acer!And that's my two cents...
