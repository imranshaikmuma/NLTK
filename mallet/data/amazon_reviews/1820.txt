Good machine for the price. Fairly sturdy case no bloatware and quick setup. Music sounds surprisingly good and full. Much better than expected and much better and slightly louder than my other HP Elitebook. Keyboard is good and keys feel solid not too mushy. No backlit keyboard but at this price I wouldn't expect it.Complaints: Plastic. I know everything's made of plastic but this thing is ALL plastic even the track pad which is incorporated into the case (see pic). It's not very sensitive and just doesn't feel great. Also the mouse keys are harder to press than they should be. It takes a bit of extra firmness to click them. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time but I wish HP had made this better than they did. One positive about the integrated trackpad is the ease of cleaning. It's smooth and rounded 3/4 lip won't trap stuff like a fully-seated pad does. I hope that makes sense. I think it does. :/That's about it. Otherwise it's a good value and I'd purchase it again.
