I've been wearing asics for years now after visiting a local running specialty store and having my gait analyzed. My last pair (and pairs before that) were a size 8 so that's what I ordered this time despite seeing some other reviews saying to go up a half or full size. I'm unsure as to whether these shoes do run small or if I'm just used to my older pair (that are fairly old) that might possibly be stretched out a bit. But either way the pair I received were a tad bit small but not unbearable. If I ordered this same pair again I would probably try an 8.5.Also wanted to say that I liked the colors in person better than on the website (wanted the blue pair but they were sold out so I got the gray/purple).
