There are so many reviews and they are all true this is a great camera so I won't go into details on that. One thing I wanted to let you all know is that you see any weirdness (for example moving waves in the video) with the 18-55 mm lens or other lenses make sure to UPGRADE the FIRMWARE on the LENS to the latest available at Fuji site. I would upgrade the Firmware on the lens even if you do not see any problems at the moment as your IS may not work optimally. The camera does not have Firmware upgrade as of the writing of this review. Check all of your lenses!The many great qualities of this camera outweigh  the few things that need improvement. Things I would have liked to see for video is the headphone jack to be on the camera and not on the grip. But maybe they did that because the battery  life is very short for video that you pretty much will have to use the grip. But still.  The shooting switch selector (video-BKT-L-H-S...) is hard to use.
