I absolutely love my Nikon D3300 and am a very amateur photographer. What I like best about the camera are the options. You can leave it on auto in order for it to pick the best settings for you or you can play around with the settings yourself. The instruction manual is pretty easy to follow along with and I have read it twice at this point but keep it handy for questions as I become more familiar with the options and buttons that I'm currently using. There are a lot of buttons though so it might not be the right camera for someone who could be overwhelmed with that.Another great part about the camera is the resolution of the pictures - they are not grainy like you can sometimes get with the smartphone cameras. These pictures are going to come out clear.The basic package for the Nikon D3300 comes with a lens of 18-55mm. This is a good lens for landscape and portraits and general taking pictures for memories but if you want something very closeup or are taking pictures of something far away you will want to also look into another lens.
