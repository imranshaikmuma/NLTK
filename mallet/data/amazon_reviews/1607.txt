As a professional carpenter I have used Carhartt for many years and have always been pleased with the quality and durability. They are made of heavy duty cotton duck and are especially useful during cold weather. I highly recommended these to professional tradesmen as they stand up to anything you can throw at them. Also if your an outdoorsman these are ideal for camping hiking or any outdoor activity. And by the way they look great and can be used for casual wear. Once they have been laundered a few times they be come very soft and comfortable. These will quickly become your favorite pair or casual everyday wear. Try them out you won't be disappointed!
