This is a very good phone for the price. Like all cheap BLU phones the battery kind of sucks. I'm kind of a phone addict who is used to expensive phones so maybe that's why. The screen is very nice and the camera is pretty darn good. I previously had the BLU Advance 5.0 with Lollipop and that one had a couple bugs. So far no bugs with this one.
