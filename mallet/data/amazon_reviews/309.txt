I love this camera. The photos and videos are awesome. You need to be close to the subject for any kind of detail. The camera is easy to use. There are only 4 buttons on it. It can also be connected to your smart phone to use as a shutter release or to make changes to the settings. I bought this to make some 360 videos for my motovlog. I wanted to give my friends a feel of what its like riding the motorcycle. I mount the camera on a selfie stick connected to the sissybar on the back on my bike. I get a really cool 3rd person view of the bike and the surrounding environment. My main complaint with the camera is the recording time. 25 minutes sounds like a lot of time but if I am riding all day I can fill it up. The battery lasts longer then the recording time.This is good when the camera is mounted behind me. I can start and stop the camera with my phone but can't power it on/off. I just got a battery pack so I can plug in and charge the camera and leave it on for the duration of the ride.I have 2 videos on my youtube channel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvWGL9IiG5sThe first video I handheld the camera and the second one was mounted behind me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bkwiwg6mlA
