I am a Veterinary Technician and I am on my feet for long hours so I spent weeks talking to fellow technicians and nurse friends about what the best shoes would be to save my poor feet from the pressure and pain of being on them for 10+ hours a day.Dansko clogs were always the first answer I received.But as many know Dansko shoes run $130+ and I was skeptical about spending that much when I had no personal experience with them. So it was a delightful surprise to find a pair for $80 on Amazon.I read the reviews here and decided to order a size up as many said they run small and wore them the very next day.I am very happy to report that even brand new they are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I also recommend getting a size bigger than your normal shoe size. If I had bought the shoe size I normally wear they would have been too tight on top.I hope this helps new buyers in your decision to try Dansko clogs.
