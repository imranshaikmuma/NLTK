For what it cost- this thing is great!Its cheap.No wifi- so you have to sync to your phone or give it a SIM card.One thing took me a few minutes to figure out.  The Sync/ Notification app for your other phone:1. it does not come in the box.2. they do not provide the link.To get the app:Tap the pale blue icon to the right of the camera icon it will open a QR code.  Use a QR code reader on your phone to get the app.Apparently my vibration doesn't work.I'm not sure what the sleep monitor does.  I clicked start when I went to bed.  It started a timer.  I clicked stop when I woke up.  It stopped the timer.  That's it.  Nothing more.Its not as small as an iWatch-Its pretty much all plastic- which also means it is very light on the wrist.So- for the price- I am impressed I'll update this review after I've used it for awhile.
