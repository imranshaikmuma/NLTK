I am self employed and use these as a part of my uniform paired with a custom made company t-shirt. Very nice for crouching and moving a lot. I like the fit much better than the standard scrub pant design. I'm not sure how you'd say they run for fit. I got the XS petite and I am 5'3" and 120lbs and wear an 8 short in American Eagle jeans. They are not a tight fit I could probably go to a XXS petite but I'm not sure if I'd get as much movement in that size. The length isn't too bad in the petite I do find that they get under the heel of my shoe every once in a while but not terribly.
