From what I read everyone said the scrubs ran large so I bought a size smaller than I usually wear. I am 5'8 and a size 16 and the large fit perfectly. The pants were however really tight in the butt ( I have a really big butt though) so if you are like me maybe just get the next size up. My friend also purchased these for a costume as well she is a size small and that's what she bought and it was way too big. Just something to keep in mind.
