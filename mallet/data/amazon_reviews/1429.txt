With 60% of the USA population either at or quickly approaching overweight status it seems like most of the clothes makers decided to change their sizing patterns/forms to accommodate them.  While that may make the manufactures rich and a lot of customers happy it makes it very difficult for a person of normal weight and size/shape to find jeans that fit properly.  It seems like all the jeans made these days are made for people with large thighs and/or butts of which I am not blessed with neither.  So every time I purchase a set of jeans they made me look malnourished and fit very oddly.  Some even look like they are riding pants because the thighs stick out on the sides like balloons.  I was about to give up looking for normal fitting jeans but decided to try one more brand and see if that made a difference and it did.  I came across these regular fit straight legs jeans made by Lee and tried them on.  Low and behold they actually fit like the jeans I used to wear when I was younger.  No saggy butt no balloon thighs and NO malnourished look!!!!  Wow I am very pleased and my wife is as well.  She says I don't look like an old man wearing "hand me down" jeans from a larger person any more.  FINALLY jeans that fit.  I was so pleased I purchased several more pairs because you never know when/if Lee will change their sizing patterns/forms.  Thank you LEE for making me feel like part of the population again.  PLEASE do not change you sizing patterns.........  A+++++
