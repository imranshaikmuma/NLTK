I offered the same review on the burgandy snap up jacket this fit is the same so I figured I would repost. I had to order a white warm up and got this and I have to say I like the zipper better in this style more convenient. Now onto the fit..The fit reviews are most important to me since I'm buying online. I don't care about thread counts or looking "stylish" because this is medical profession attire NOT for a fashion show. These are not the most beautiful jackets in the world but very comfortable. Anyway I have bought cherokee because I find it to fit me the best. I have a small chest and a big butt & hips most reviews don't talk about the fit of this area. When you buy online you need this info.What I have found with Cherokee scrub tops is they are small in the chest area this works for me but may not for others. Most likely if you are a C Cup or above it may be uncomfortable. But with this jacket it's actually big but the butt/hip area is small for me. So I ordered a size up from my normal size medium cherokee fit. I ordered a large in this and I'm glad I did because the lower band on it is snug on my hips/butt. It is rather boxy up top because I don't fill it but I am ok with it.So if you have hips/butt order a size up because it probably won't fit if you order your normal top size. I am 5'3 and the length of this covers half of my butt snugly.Hope this helps others with the "booty" struggle!!
