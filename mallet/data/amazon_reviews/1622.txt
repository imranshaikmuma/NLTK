this is just amazing. this is the 3rd waterproofing spray brand i have tried and i am the most happy with this one. I left my review for 303 (30604) Fabric Guard Trigger Sprayer 32 Fl. oz as well which explained all the differences in all the waterproofing sprays and my personal expericne. Even though this is 10 oz 2/3 of the bottle did that 303 fabric guard 32oz couldn't do. the result was very good too. if you think all the waterproofing spray is the same and then you are wrong. there are real differences in consistency. this sprays the right amount and covered large areas. I used it to treat a pair of outdoor curtain and i couldn't be happier. if the spray makes you fatigue for a bigger job and go get a spray paint trigger to add it on. It costed my $1.99 at Walmart which i previously purchased for pray paint jobs.
