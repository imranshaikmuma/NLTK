I'm on my second pair of these shoes because I love them.  They are attractive fun and comfortable. I only run short distances in them because I need more support for running but I wear them all day long and also when riding my bike. Eventually after about 6 months my big toe will rub through the fabric on top--that's the one drawback. When that happens I will invest in a third pair.
