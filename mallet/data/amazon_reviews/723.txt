It's a very entry level android phone you will come around a few problems like not being able to install many apps or running any new or currently updated apps without the phone running out of RAM or freezing. I recommend this for traveling or having an extra handset in case of emergencies when you lose or break your current phone. May also be good for the elderly who would like to learn to use current technology and not break the bank for it. Battery life is OK just like any phone supports dual-sim card BLU Android software is sub par.
