I've had this phone for a little under a week and it is amazing! I love how to operating system works and how beautiful it is. The camera is crisp and clean. This is coming from someone Who obsesses about picture quality on Instagram. It launches quickly whether you double press the home button or click it on the screen. In the time I've had it I haven't had any app problems. The phone itself is quite responsive. I remember reading the reviews and seeing that someone complained that it gets hot when charging and that the box was opened and resealed(mine came sealed). I did notice that the first two instances where I charged my phone it became a pretty warm however I believe it's due to the phone's first charge similar to the phone taking longer to charge the first time you use it. In addition to that I've also noticed that the battery life got better after the first few charges. The fingerprint scanner also works very well comparable to the iphone 6s.Will update if anything changes.
