I just received these boots today and I am over the moon for them. Aside from a quick trip to the bus stop I haven't really given them a full hike yet but they are fantastic so far and incredibly warm with full insulation. The color is fantastic and not accurate in the preview images. I've included a few images for a more accurate reference.
