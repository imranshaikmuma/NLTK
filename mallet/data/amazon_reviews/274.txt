So I have to admit I wasn't sure this set up was going to be strong enough or comfortable enough to actually use but I have to say I am extremely impressed! I'm one of those women whose shoulders are so narrow that any strap purse etc... almost automatically slips down my arm the minute I place it on my shoulders. I also had no desire to have any type of "belt" around my waist. This set-up is EXACTLY what I was looking for minus the $100+ price point. The straps are padded extremely well the straps can set up to be very long or very short and the hardware is very strong. I haven't had a chance to put this set-up thru a full day of shooting sports just yet but I can already tell it's going to do the job!
