I have shot thousands of photos w/ the Coolpix P600 over the years. I got this camera for the RAW feature and the added Megapixels.This is the same P600 body but in a Matte Finish and so a bit grippier.Uses the same battery EN-EL23 and the same cards so I was good to go.After setting to RAW + F (fine) Image Size to 20 M and turning off the digital zoom I took it for a test spin.I'll be using this primarily for birding so I started there.First impressions are Viewfinder is FAR better than the P600 Zoom is smoother and Auto Focus (you probably will not want to us Manual Focus as it's a pain) is faster VR (image stabilization) is KILLER!Single point Focus is dead on as you can see from the shot of a Sparrow buried in the rose bush.Full Zoom (not digital) is dead on crisp. The Cardinal was shot on a windy cloudy dark day in AP Mode (lighter Cardinal shots) and Bird Mode at about 50'. Hand held and braced. Cardinals at full optical zoom.So far I am VERY Impressed!If you are a Birder and Nature shooter you will LOVE this Camera!P600/610 on steroids.Haven't used the Wi-Fi Snap Feature or Video yet so I can't speak to that.
