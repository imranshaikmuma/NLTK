I must say and admit I was a little concerned about this choice after I bought it but I said "Well what the heck let's give it a try!" It was for my mom anyway but on paper it looked like a nice budget phone and also I had extra concerns cause I'm not from usa so retuning this was out of the table. I had to accept whatever came on the box. Fortunately I was wrong.. The product came in perfect condition and brand new of course no problems with packaging or shipping. And after first hands on the phone you won't believe you pay 60 bucks (after taxes and handling) for this phone.. I MEAN IT! This guys  (BLU Inc. ) are doing an awesome job with budget phones. This phone is really awesome. Of course it doesn't look fancy or premium because it's obviously plastic but you fell like you have a 500$ phone in your hands..So if you are looking for a budget phone DO NOT hesitate of this one.. you won't be sorry!!
