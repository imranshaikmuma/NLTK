I recently purchased this camera to replace my D5100.  There was nothing wrong with my old camera but I wanted to upgrade anyway.  The kit lens does a great job of being a nice walk around lens.  I don't find myself swapping lenses nearly as much.  I also really like the built in wifi feature.  I took some photos at a nephews graduation and afterwards I was able to drop them into the family's phones so they could do the usual uploads to social media and email them to other family.  Have 2 SD slots is a nice touch as you can set one to store images in JPEG and the other in RAW.  While I did like the flip out screen on my D5100 I didn't use it all that often so I don't think I will miss it much.  I think this camera is a great stepping stone before going to full frame.
