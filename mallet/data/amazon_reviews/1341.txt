These arrived today with the afternoon mail and I never want to take them off!  They fit perfectly so comfortable so soft!  I am 5'3" and about 190 lbs.  I ordered XL and I guess I could have gone down one size but I really wanted these for comfort so went for XL.  I will definitely be buying more!So....I did buy more - in the Black this time and the same size - and now I am sad!  I can get them on...just barely.  These must go back.  I do not understand how the color could make a difference in the size but...there it is.
