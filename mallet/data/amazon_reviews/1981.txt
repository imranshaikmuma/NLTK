I love this pc. It does everything I need it to. I downloaded ms 2016 word on on. Not a glitch really went smoothly. I was able to start typing up APA papers in no time. I had to adjust to the shift key being a bit smaller than my HP. I keep hitting the arrow key. That being said I am adjusting. I love how fast it runs and helps me get my school work done. Very pleased for the price and what I use it for. Updated review I think the speaker quality is poor. One good thing is it is Bluetooth compatible so I just hook it up with my Bluetooth speaker and it works. For those who want good sound it's a must. I have still not figure out why it has the ability to go in tablet mode but it does it.
