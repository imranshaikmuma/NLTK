I've read all the other comments and everyone seems happy I must have gotten a lemon. The camera fit all my needs; small size wide angle lens and AA batteries but I am so frustrated with the inconsistencies and issues with it I want to throw it in the trash! First it does not have a setting to force the flash which I need all the time to take interior photos of homes (real estate appraiser). Either the flash will not flash and/or if I adjust the light exposure the pics are either way too dark or way too light. Several times they have been just solid black or solid white. I have wasted hours on end trying to get it adjusted and when it is finally right (at the moment) it reverts back to the default as soon as its turned off & back on.  Very unhappy!
