I love it. It works super. Its easy to use. The first time I printed pictures that I took with it I had to sign that I was the photographer. They looked to professional to the clerk. I'd definitely recommended it to anyone looking for a camera that takes great pictures. I admit I stalled a little at the price but after seeing how good it takes pictures I don't regret buying it.
