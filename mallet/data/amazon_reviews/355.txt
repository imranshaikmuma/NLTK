I am on holiday with this camera now.  Thought i should give potential buyers the good and bad.So far it seems to take good pictures from what i can see on the camera's screen or from my smart phone when i move pictures over.Now for the bad.There is already dust collecting under the top lens.  There is no way to clean it off.  This will only get worse with time.  Poor design to allow that to happen.Second problem is the mode indicator dial has wiped clean.  See the picture i loaded.  Whatever ink they used did not last more than 10 days.  Another poor design choice.I would think about returning it but cannot as i am on holiday with no way to return it and then replace it.  I am not confident of its long term reliability with what i can see in a few weeks use.  This camera is too expensive to last maybe a year and have to be replaced.
