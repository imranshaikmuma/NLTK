The fit was great I wear a 4/6 in dresses ordered a size medium and its a nice comfy fit and not tight. The length was right above my knee and I'm 5'6". The black color is sheer in bright lights. As soon as I address my concerned customer service fixed it. I would recommend this seller since hey customer service was amazing. They responded within a few hours and made sure I was happy with their product. Shipping was also faster than expected.
