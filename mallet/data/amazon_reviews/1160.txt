Me:  5’2 116 lbs Purchased size small (fits fine the way I like).I purchased all 4 pairs and will give individual reviews on each accordingly:1.  90 Degree By Reflex 22" Yoga Capris Lightning Blue S2.  90 Degree by Reflex Power Flex Yoga Pants - Red – Small3.  90 Degree By Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Shapewear - Power Flex Capri Legging - Quality Guaranteed - Reflex Blue Small4.  Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Watermelon S22" Yoga Capris Lightning Blue S:  I purchased the same pair from Marshalls and am the kind of person that if I like something I want it in all colors and even have double of things.  After not being able to find my size and the color I wanted at several of the Marshalls and TJMaxx I went to I found it on Amazon.  I love the color and fit.  The length is nice it's below the calf which I like and about 4 inches above my ankle.  There is a fingers width space between the leg opening and my skin but I don't mind that loose look and beside I can hike it up higher if I want it to be snug.My complaint is because I'm very particular and will examine every stitching and line this capris is slightly a lighter color than the one I have and they're supposedly both lightning blue.  Another thing is the stitching looks a little cheaper (see picture the one in the back is from Marshalls and the one in the front I ordered from here).  The stitching is off a little and there's a "hump" in the waist band that probably wouldn't bother other people but it bothers me.  It's not bad enough for me to return and not worth the hassle to return so I will be keeping the pants.
