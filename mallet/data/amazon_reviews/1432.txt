I was looking for an alternative to Wranglers for my brother that is classic and at the same time fashionable and I'm very pleased with how these jeans turned out. My brother has been using these as his go-to jeans when going to school (alternating them with his Wranglers). The 30L is just perfect for someone who is within 5'7" - 5'8"—there's just some wee left over to cover the shoes but not much that they touch the ground. They also don't look baggy. One might think that at first glance when they are out of the bag that they are going to be hip-hop baggy—but no! They are in the smaller side though waist-wise. Case in point 28Wx30L in Wrangler fits my brother well—though he uses a belt with them. With these jeans the waistline is a wee bit on the "just right"—too tight if one's just had their meal. I recommend if one is on the mid-sizing i.e. with some 0.5 in the measurements go a size higher—it is easier to keep the jeans in place with a belt than have a product returned.Overall they are great and I bought several of these!
