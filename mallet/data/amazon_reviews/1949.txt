This laptop replaced a 5 year old Macbook Pro 13" that performed perfectly.  What I bought was almost identical to the super 5 year old laptop.  The newest Macbook Pro was almost twice the price as the one I just bought and I didn't like the latest laptop with it's magic bar feature that replaced the usual function keys.  $800 extra dollars for that 'magic bar' wasn't worth it.  I'm very happy with the new laptop and the seller performed great in all respects.  I'll buy from them again when the time comes -- 5 years from now.
