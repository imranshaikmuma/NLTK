These are decent compression shorts. I usually wear either the UA Mesh Boxerjock or Nike Pro Combat ones as boxers and not necessarily for athletics. The fit on these is good although there's not much support for your important bits. The construction feels okay but not quite on par with the UA or Nikes so for a few extra dollars I'd recommend either of those instead. If the price of those is a deal-breaker for you then these are quite alright aside from a very long and invasive tag on the inside. Seriously it's almost 2017 there should never ever be a physical tag in any pair of underwear at this point. Manufactures need to print the info directly on the inside of the fabric and save people having to cut them out or deal with the discomfort.
