This device does not have very many reviews like other Blu devices. I have ordered many Blu devices in the past and most have at least a few hundred reviews. These have been very helpful in allowing me to decide on whether I am interested in the device. So I will post my review here and offer some insight for those interested.In the box you receive the typical Blu package: the phone a power adapter earbuds a TPU case and a screen protector. All of these items arrived intact and met all expectations. The screen protector that came with this device had some quirks that some may want to be aware of. Unlike most screen protectors this one was NOT completely transparent. The screen protector had a special color print for the bezel of the device covering the white face and replacing it with a rose gold finish. This was fine except that the size of the print on the screen protector was slightly off making it very difficult to place the protector without covering the screen or the ports. I was able to get down pretty close but the added printing made it much more difficult to apply.When installing the battery and SIM I ran into the same difficulty removing the backplate of the device. Once removed however things were easy. Do not let this deter you from purchasing this phone. The phone booted up nicely with a vivid and colorful display and otherwise had 0 issues. A great phone for the price thus far.
