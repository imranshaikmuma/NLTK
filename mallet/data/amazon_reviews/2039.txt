This computer is sweet runs everything I play on max settings and doesn't get hot. (Dota 2 Rainbowsix Siege Battlefield 4 GTA V Starcraft) No problems or complaints at all. The lowest I've seen fps get to is about 80. I've owned a lenovo y50 with an 860m and i7 and an msi GE62 with an i7 and 960m. I like this one a lot more.
