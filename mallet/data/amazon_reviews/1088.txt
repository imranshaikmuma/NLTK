This is a fantastic petticoat. I'm a size 18/20 and I think the XL could even fit up to a 22/24.  The sizing chart is spot on!  There are two layers of "chiffon" with a red under slip beneath that. The top has elastic at the waist but also has stretch to the material.  It could have a slimming effect but this depends on your body type. The skirt shook out to a flounce (I didn't need to steam) and was very well priced. Thank you!
