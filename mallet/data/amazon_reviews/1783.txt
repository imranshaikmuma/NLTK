I purposely ordered these shirts to be oversize since I was using them to wear to bed. They are thin like an undershirt should be and they are quite long which I imagine would help keeping them tucked in if worn as an undershirt. They also seem to be well made and should last a while. The one big problem for something described as "ComfortSoft Cotton." the shirts do not really seem that soft. While not scratchy I also would not call them soft. I guess from the description I was expecting something more along the lines of pima cotton.
