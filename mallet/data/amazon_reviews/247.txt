My review is geared more towards beginners like myself who are just getting into the DSLR world.I've been shooting with the D5300 for a few months now. I bought this camera because it was at a lower price point for an entry level amateur photographer and I've been having a great time with it.I've used this camera mainly for photographing friends and family nature/scenery my dogs and random still-life scenes that captured my attention. I haven't really captured action except with the video.Pros:1. Light weight (for a DSLR)2. Good beginners camera. Controls not too difficult to learn (the user interface helped me get used to different ISO aperture and shutter speed settings)3. Swivel screen is very useful especially when taking videos low to the ground or photos above a crowd.4. Great battery life (new to me compared to point-and-shoots)5. WiFi useful for quickly transferring photos to a tablet and emailing to friends and family.  I haven't used the GPS function though.Cons:1. DX format (starting to learn about the limitations versus a full frame (i.e. more expensive) camera2. Video focus tough to use (I guess I still have a lot to learn :P)3. Lenses are expensive and there are soooooooo many accessories out there (my wallet is much lighter than I anticipated)4. Settings can be a bit cumbersome and overwhelming for a beginner but I'm getting the hang of it.I definitely recommend this camera but I would recommend getting the only the body if you plan on picking up additional lenses (starting with the $200 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor). I bought this camera with the 18-55mm VRII lens which is a good beginners lens. I've stopped using that lens since I got the 35mm f/1.4 Nikkor and haven't used the kit lens ever since.Overall this is a great camera and I've been having a great time with photography. At the end of the day the camera is only a tool but I'm glad I got this one and have no regrets about it.
