I am seeing some professional photographers saying they aren't a huge fan of the Rebel series but that's simply because their needs and talents have surpassed the level of the Rebel. I am not a professional photographer. That being said THIS CAMERA IS AMAZING!! I started taking photos with a Rebel xti which is about 10 years old so you can only imagine how excited I was to play with something from this decade. I love the swivel screen because it makes it easier to take pictures that are maybe lower to the ground (babies dogs etc) or at some other weird angles. While I haven't yet figured out the complexities of photography I wanted to share a few pictures I took so you could see the absolutely GORGEOUS quality of photos it takes. One of them you can see the little flecks of dust and pollen on a flower! Are you kidding me? If you're wanting to try photography as a new hobby or get a camera that can help you take photos of travels and family just take the plunge and buy this. I've been suggested to get the 55mm f/1.8 or even 55mm f/1.4 lens for great portraits but I haven't gotten it yet.
