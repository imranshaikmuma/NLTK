This is NOT a sturdy camera. The first trip I took it on was overseas and I tripped in fell. It was not a hard fall and the camera was closed and in my purse.  Nevertheless the screen broke and I was unable to take pictures for the rest of my trip.  Giving it 2 stars because the few pictures I got were OK and I liked the pretty blue color of the camera.My other objection is that the memory card Sony uses is proprietary and not a standard card that can be interchanged with other cameras. Will be looking for a different brand next time.
