You can not get a better value for price. Everything about this laptop is amazing.Following is a list of my personal PROs and CONs. These factors may or may not be important or relevant to everyonePROs:1. Super fast. Not just fast but super fast. Thanks to DDR4 RAM and NVMe M2 SSD this laptop will ruin every other laptop for you. Because everything else seems slow after you have this laptop.2. Looks really nice.3. Excellent battery life.4. Light weight.CONs:1. It has a glossy screen. However It is a wonderful 4k screen which works perfectly fine indoors and I also use a secondary monitor. It does not bother me so much. Only sometimes.2. Sound. The highest volume is average at the best. Okay for indoor use. Could have been louder.
