My prehistoric computer finally died and I had to get something to replace it.  Having a very...helpful four year old I didn't want to get anything terribly expensive as she murdered my new tablet as well.  After looking into the whole Chrome vs Windows thing I decided that everything I do is via a Google app/site/thing so why not.  I don't need to store a lot of stuff since cloud.This came in a nice little box within a box. All parts were in excellent order with the cute little plastic clings to show how new it wasSet up was in less than five minutes and the little intro was helpful.  This thing is C-U-T-E!  I'm not used to the touch pad nor the whole laptop thing but I'm finding it works well.  Fat fingers aren't an issue.Now I'm no techie nor do I know anything about computers so I am pretty useless with that part of the review; keep in mind my PC was running XP.  For someone who needs a cute little computer for light use this is perfect.  It isn't terribly heavy which is a bonus.The tutorials on how to convert Word programs to Google apps is quite helpful as well.
