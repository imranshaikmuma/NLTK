It is an OK camera. Small and very portable. Takes decent pictures as long as the flash is not used. It gives you options to adjust exposure but there was no difference in the brightness of pictures with different exposure settings. Do not use flash when taking a picture of a near by object. All you'll see is a white blob. No memory for the settings that you make. As soon as you turn off the power all changes you made in the setting goes back to defult.
