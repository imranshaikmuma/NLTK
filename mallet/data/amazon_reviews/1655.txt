This is my third pair of these shoes.  I walk about 15 miles a week in them. They are light and supportive with a nice cushiony feel inside. I bought the wide because the Normal width wasn't available and it was the answer to my pinched toes. I'd rather tighten the laces than hope my shoes stretch. It seems they wear out more quickly than other shoes I've purchased for walking. 6 months is about as long as I can use them for my 3 mile walks. Even when the tread is getting thin and the sock liner is compressed they are still comfortable.
