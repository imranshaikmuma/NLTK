We ordered this camera as a REFURB and were not sure exactly what a REFURB would end up being.Knowing that AMAZON would stand behind the sale we took a chance on a NOT NEW $846.00 Camera package.Camera arrived today and in a white box clearly marked REFURBISHED and then we held our breath.Camera Body Lens Manuals Cables Camera Strap Battery Wall Charger etc... are ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS!Not a single mark scratch rub spot or anything to show that this was not a brand new "A" stock item and we saved about 180.00 from the new one.This is an AWESOME DEAL!Includes a 90 day versus a Year warranty from Nikon. If anything was wrong with the camera  it would certainly show up ( develop...( I couldn't resist that one )) before the warranty period expired.Took the Difference in $ and ordered a hard case (Mega Gear) Silicone body cover (Delkin) Extra Battery grip (Vivitar) Screen Protector (Larmor) and still have some coin left over.If you are looking for this type of camera. Try the REFURB!
