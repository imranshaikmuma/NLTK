It's rare that I get something that I talk about constantly. This is one of those rare occasions. I researched computers for three weeks before making my purchase and when you combine price and functionality this is the best that i found. I've had my Zenbook Flip for a week now and I'm still excited about it. Battery life is exceptional it's light weight easy to carry and intuitive to use. The only thins that is taking me some time to get use to is when I pick it up my clumsy fingers change the tab on the open window. This is all in the way I pick it up though. This is a product I would recommend for people who do a lot of traveling.
