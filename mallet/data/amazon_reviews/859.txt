The description says new but the phone came used when I opened the back to put in my SIM card there was dirt and went inside and smudges all over the speaker and camera lens. There was no protective film on the camera lens and the box was papers and slide on cover. I bought a exact same phone last year and still had everything that came with it. Don't waste your money! Buy a new phone from a reputable dealer
