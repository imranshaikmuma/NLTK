It works.  This is a tiny camera a little smaller than a pencil in diameter.  It took a couple of tries to get the app to recognize the camera but once it did it worked well.  I had hoped that the camera woul dbe able to focus on objects really close to the lens but it appears that the minimim focal distance is a couple of inches.  Great for looking into wall cavities and other hidden places.  Ever wondered what was inside of .... this will let you see it.  Stiff enough to feed it in through a small hole and control it's whereabouts.
