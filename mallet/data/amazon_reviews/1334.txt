I love this shirt it fits snug even though its cotton. I am able to move around just fine without any restrictions. I wear it under my nursing scrubs  and even though this shirt did not cost me $ 25 .00 or more it is just as good as the ones I have paid that amount for in the past. The sleeve length is appropriate and is not too short and some of the other reviews state.I am pretty picky too so I am confused at some of the other not so favororable reviews that I have read.
