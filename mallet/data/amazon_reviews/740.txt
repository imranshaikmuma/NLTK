I received the phone in time. Bought it from PRIME ELECTRONICS. It looks like new and it works great. The phone is an iPhone 5s unlocked. I have checked the imei and it is all clear. Tried the battery. I opened all the apps at the same time and I left the gps on. The battery was still 30% after 8 hours. Overall I am very happy with this product.
