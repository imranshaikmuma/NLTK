I am 5'7 size 10 36C so I purchased a large.  It is very roomy really needs a belt to make it flattering. It hits me just above the knees.  I like the pockets and the contoured seams. I purchased it in red the color is a bit lighter/brighter than I had hoped.  It's soft and comfortable so I decided to keep it but I will likely order a medium if I order another one.
