I am 5'3 and 129#. I wear 34D bra and my hips are approx 36 ". I bought the small. It is snug yet comfy. The arms are snug. It's snug across the chest and hips. My only problem is that it did shrink lengthwise when I washed and dried it. The fabric is thin and comfortable. The neck is not too tight which is an issue I have with normal tshirts.It can be worn alone or under scrubs. I bought the Caribbean blue which is a little darker than a lot of scrub brands (Cherokee wonderwink). I would say it's pretty true to the product picture.I ordered another one in black :)Pics shown in Adar Caribbean blue shirt with Cherokee Caribbean blue pants.
