I just wasn't impressed with these the material is a bit thinner than I expected and the fit was just a bit awkward on me.  I think this has more to do with me than the pants themselves I ended up also buying a pair of dickies I love much more.Overall these will get the job done but I just wasn't impressed seemed more flash than function and certainly didn't fit as loose and comfy as they looked (but I'm also not a super thin person either)
