Camera:I Love This Camera!  Upgraded from a Pentax K-x (now 6 years old)..What an UPGRADE!  It's so much quieter faster and full of amazing technology!  It takes such amazing quality pictures!  This is actually pushing me to go beyond and improve my understanding and knowledge of photography...how?  it does not have the "pre-set scene settings"... Like "Portrait" mode or "Landscape" mode....Which I started breaking away from on my k-x that's how it I knew it was time... Upgrade!Lenses:All of my lenses for my K-x fit on this camera and work just fine!Recall:About the recall the serial number I have does fall below the "622...." number...However I have had Zero issues with the camera.Competition:I did buy a Nikon a few weeks ago honestly could not stand the thing!  I took it right back to store for a refund!!!Seller: "Web Offers"Shipping from this company was BLAZING FAST!  Tracking was fantastic too!  Fast to respond to inquiries and answer questions!  Thank you!2 of my pictures using the K-3IIHere are 2 pics I took in the last 2 days -  1 is a Sandhill Crane the other a Sunflower.Yes there are areas for improvement I'm not a professional photographer (YET) just a rookie that loves....photography!  Hope this is helpful!
