I was really impressed.  I have been using a 5 year old Canon Powershot with water housing to take underwater photo so D30 is a real step up.  I have an older Nikon DSLR for photo on land so D30 gave me HD Video and better MP.Transitioning out of water (beach snorkeling or pictures on dive boat etc.) and having to wipe the water off the glass covering the lenses is an annoyance when you have no access to dry towel.  Some reviews mentioned using Rain-X I wonder if that worked.On the last day of my trip the camera took in moisture and fogged up the LCD display.  It seems the water leaked in from the HDMI door on the side of the camera NOT the SD card and battery door. So at least it didn't fry the camera or damage the SD.  I only open that door once when I received the camera and I had no issues in 10 meter salt or fresh water scuba dive.  It only leaked in shallow water.  I was able to "dry" the moisture by opening both doors and put the camera under the sun and let the moisture evaporate and the camera seems to work... I am leaning towards returning this within Amazon's return window and get a new one in case this is a lemon.
