They seem like well made boots that will keep my feet cosy warm and dry from rain or snow. The whole inside is insulated including the top inside of the toe.Color- I got the yellow ones and it's not really yellow I'd call it tan or brown mustard.Fit- fits as expected. Loose enough that I can wear a pair of thick warm socks and it fits nicely. They are also easy to take on and off with the zipper.Comfort- soft and lightweight. Footbed is cushy not much arch support.
