Great buy so far. Haven't had any problems and all the reviews about its specs were pretty spot on. Some big pluses I personally have noticed are its battery life being 5 hours+ watching movies or doing homework (3-4 if playing a game maybe less if it's more hardware intensive) and stays relatively cool (warm but never hot like other laptops I have used). Pleased with the machine.
