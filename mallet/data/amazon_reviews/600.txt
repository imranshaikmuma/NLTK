The camera works well but make sure you do some testing before you miss an irreplaceable moment (or many of them).Here's a big tip.  When you prepare to gather your camera to process the videos make sure you press and hold the enter button until the screen says processing.  If you just press it quickly it starts recording a new video RIGHT OVER THE ONE YOU ACTUALLY WANT!!  Then you just have a time lapse video of your feet.You'll also need to test how often it takes a picture and the frame rate to make sure it turns out correctly.  Don't spend days filming something only to find out it isn't what you were expecting.Finally if you are recording a long term time lapse and not including nightitme hours you'll need to download some free video editing software such as Windows Movie Maker to stitch them back together because it creates a new video for each day of recording.Overall I have enjoyed using this camera.  I have used it mainly for demolition and construction projects.  It can be fascinating to watch over and over.  I also like to watch quicker ones for cloud activity etc.  For a time lapse camera that doesn't require a continuous power source you'll have a hard time finding a better one.
