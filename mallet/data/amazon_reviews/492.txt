Not happy with this camera I bought it to replace the camera on my Note 5 cell phone. The note 5 is better. I had a very hard time making this camera take decent shots everything indoor was so blurry even with sun coming through the windows! I would say 9 out of 10 shots were so blurry that I had to delete them. It was like the shutter speed was stuck on turtle mode. The pictures taken at night were not any better than my phone as well so a miss on that. I guess this camera is good if you are only going to take pictures outside of things that do not move at all...like a rock.. if there is any wind to blow the subject then you can forget about it.I really wanted to love this camera and I'm sad that I can't.
