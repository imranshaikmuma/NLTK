Initial reaction to this laptop has been very positive.  It seems to be a really great unit for a mid-range user especially for the price.  A big drawing card was the user-reviewed absence of the bloatware that makes many computer purchases the preamble for the ordeal of removing all or most of it.  The "precision touchpad" turned out to be a bit schitzoid for someone accustomed to having a touchpad with right/left click buttons.  Dealing with it while grappling with Windows 10 as a new user resulted in the computer frequently doing strange and unwanted things.  A very comfortable solution was to turn off the touchpad in favor of a Bluetooth mouse.  The internal battery poses some mild concern but time will tell if that is or isn't a problem.  The laptop is reasonably light and thin without feeling flimsy and the slightly textured exterior makes it easy to hold.
