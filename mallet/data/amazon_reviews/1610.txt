These are the toughest pants for the price - worth double what they are listed for.  I own a landscaping and irrigation company in AZ and I wear these almost every day. I switch them out with the brown pair.  It's now May so they might be a little warm during our 110+- coming in June July and August but we will see. Quality is superb!  If you're on the fence DO NOT HESITATE. These are the best and made in the USA!  I did just order the Carhartt Force Tappen Cargos and they will probably be what I wear here in AZ during summer. The colder states would probably be fine year round.SIZINGI wear a 36x32 in Levis 501 and the waste on the carhartts is similar but the inseam is pretty long. I ordered the 36x32 in brown and they are way long (fit more like 36x34) but I don't mind too much. If you're riding a motorcycle or horse you will like the added length. I ordered the black in 36x30 and I would say they fit closer to a 36x32 if you were comparing to levis 501.
