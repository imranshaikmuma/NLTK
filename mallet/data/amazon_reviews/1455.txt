I buy these shirts all the time for my husband.  The sleeves on these shirts are over an inch shorter and the collar is tighter and the whole shirtis slightly smaller.  I noticed these were made in Haiti and the shirts that are the same size that he bought last year are made in Honduras.  They are much more comfortable.  Also the short sleeve shirts I bought earlier in the year from you were make in Honduras.  I already threw away all the shipping packaging.  If you  have some make in Honduras I would love to trade these in.  Can I still send them back without packaging?
