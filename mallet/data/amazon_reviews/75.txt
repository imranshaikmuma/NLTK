Excellent shooter with friendly controls.  I'm not a pro but was looking to move to a superior "prosumer" grade camera.  I wanted to find the right balance between cost and performance that offered a good value for my skill level.  This has been great so far and has great picture quality. The ability to rapidly shoot with little to no shutter delay has made all the difference when taking pictures of my small children and it is light enough to easily carry around all day while on vacation overseas. The controls are not intimidating and I'm looking forward to learning more about the many features the camera offers.
