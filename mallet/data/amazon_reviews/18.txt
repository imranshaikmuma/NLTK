While this camera has a 4.5 rating right now on Amazon potential buyers should know: in order to use Bluetooth to transfer photos to your phone or tablet Nikon does not allow you to use third-party apps. You need to use the Nikon app Snapbridge which currently has 1.5 stars with 279 reviews on the Apple App Store. The main issue is the camera simply does not pair to devices. Nikon Support has an article which says they're having trouble with the new Apple iOS but this article is over a month old and the poor Snapbridge reviews pre-date the iOS update. I bought the camera based on the high Amazon reviews and now wish I had made an informed decision considering Snapbridge's poor performance which is why I am posting this for other potential buyers to see.
