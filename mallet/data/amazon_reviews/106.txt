Great starter DSLR.  This is my first camera that is not a point-and-shoot and it's great especially for the price.  The lens that comes with it is also pretty darn good.  The automatic settings do a really good job of picking shutter speeds f stops and white balances for great photos.  I also really like the aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings.  The shutter speed priority setting is especially useful for taking photos when motion is an issue such as from a moving vehicle.  lso there is a great feature in some modes that allows you to set 3 exposure levels and take 3 photos at different exposures.  Doing this is not very intuitive though and takes some manual reading.I do wish that this camera could take photos in aspect ratios other than 3:2 but that's all it can do.  There is no panorama setting either.Overall a very good camera as a first DSLR.  A huge upgrade from point and shoot.
