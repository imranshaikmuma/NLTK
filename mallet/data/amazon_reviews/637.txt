I buy one of these each year for work. I know what you may be thinking...one per year? they must be junk!Not really. I take 100 photo's per day in some of the worst places...attics and crawlspaces...it gets dropped in dirt onto wood porches off roofs and even in my pocket that gets dirt into it. ...so it takes a real beating over a period of a year....they continue to work but the buttons start falling off and it becomes unusable.It takes great pictures for the price and wifi download is so simple...takes about 5 minutes to transfer 100 photo's.Downside is that the cost of this little unit is getting out of hand. I first started buying them at $120 now they are close to $200.00.Finding the right model is tough...there are just too many cameras with the cybershot name and trying to distinguish b/t each model is difficult.....looked for awhile to find the model that still has wifi that was affordable. Affordable being...a camera under $200 that will only last me a year.
