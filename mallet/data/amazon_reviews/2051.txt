**Update: Targus 45W USB C Charger works perfect to quick charge this laptop and my Nexus 5x.  Got it for $29 and has foldable prongs.Upgraded from a 7 year old Macbook Pro finally been a long time coming.Pros are it's refreshingly light (amazing what they can do with a 15 inch laptop) the screen truly is beautiful in its color rendition and minimal borders (craigslisted my 1080p monitor because this one does the job almost as well just make sure to change display scaling back to 100%) the keyboard is comfy has a webcam and microphone in the normal spot on the screen (niggle with how Dell's XPS line does it) runs quiet side firing speakers are loud and sound great depending on the surface you place it on thoughtful collection of ports something I would've personally chosen if I designed the laptop upgradeable cheap m.2 SATA3 ssd (1TB for $250 on amazon) boots up in a couple seconds includes wired ethernet adapter clean thin modern design that isn't gaudy.Cons are the trackpad drivers aren't as well done as Apple's Macbook lineup (Windows laptops have come a long way though and this one is surprising good just not as good) the battery life estimate fluctuates quite widely from 10 hr to 3 hr but generally it should last a while even with its puny battery because of the low wattage components (they did sacrifice battery life at the alter of a light design) the material is like half plastic half metal feeling scratches easier than a pure aluminum laptop hard to find accessories compared to Apple's laptops like multi colored plastic cases etc Windows 10 is cool but still less polished than Mac OS X there are duplicate options everywhere (4 different locations to change 6 different power settings) and you have to be ok with tinkering with it to get it to work the way you want (persistent registry entries when you uninstall apps) and definitely glitches on the daily to troubleshoot.  I've used Windows before college so I know my way around and I like tinkering so it works out for me.Two years ago I would've never considered a Windows laptop they were too ugly the trackpads were inferior user experiences the display quality was lacking poor battery life and lol Windows 8.  Now I have a Windows laptop and I love using Windows 10.  Also sold an iPhone and got a Nexus Android 7.0 device.  There are so many choices out there if you want to try something new doesn't necessarily mean its better though it does give you more freedom over your devices than Apple's ecosystem with the tradeoff of less support accessories and one-off designs.
