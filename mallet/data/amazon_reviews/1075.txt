I was very skeptical about the "one size fits most" thing. These are the most comfortable pair of leggings I have ever adorned my stems with. There were minor physical imperfections (i.e. slight runs near the thigh areas loose threading) but for the price and comfort I don't care. These are wonderful and I will buy more in the future.
