I bought this camera to replace my Canon Rebel T2i that was water damaged irreparably. When choosing this model I preferred the options of the T6 over the more expensive T6i. For example I do not need stabilization because any lenses I have which may require it (mainly telephoto) incorporate that feature. I recommend any buyer carefully decide what features they'll actually use (not just what sounds good) before choosing between this model and the T6i. You may save yourself some money and still get a good camera. Also for anyone who may need it this model is very good in low light. If you shoot natural light photos (no flashes here I shoot insects and arachnids) you'll have more color range in lower light settings.
