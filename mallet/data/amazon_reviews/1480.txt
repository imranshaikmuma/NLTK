So I bought a few sets of black scrubs last week to wear for my new job this week. Washed the scrubs this weekend and wore the second pair today. Midway through my day I realized the small memo tab I had in my side pocket felt like it was slipping on my leg. I placed my hand through the pocket to find a ginormous hole. Basically the entire seam line running through the pocket was completely split. Such a waste of money :(
