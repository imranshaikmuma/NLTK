After the considerable issues I had with the iCamera keep (wouldn't stay connected to Wi-Fi never connected to live view!) I didn't have high hopes for Spot. I was wrong.Super easy to setup was up and running within a few minutes with zero connection issues. This little camera has restored my faith in iSmart alarm.The video quality is acceptable at 720p but where it really shines is with the night vision. I wasn't expecting much but I was blown away at how clear everything was in total darkness.As others have mentioned the audio is a little annoying because you have to switch back and forth between talking and listening within the app but really are you expecting to have a full on conversation with a thief or your pet? I can live it.To anyone debating between the spot or the iCamera? Save your money and go with spot!!
