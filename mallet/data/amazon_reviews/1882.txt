Great PC for the money just have to be willing to store large files on Google Docs Microsoft OneDrive ICloud etc as hard drive space is limited.  That should not be a problem if most of you activity is email & Web Browsing.  Nice compact package & good quality hardware Lenovo used to be IBM Laptops 7 good to see they kept the quality up  I had to call customer support (because of my mistake) & they were quick to respond & had me back in operation under 30 minutes.
