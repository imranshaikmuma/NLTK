I've had this camera for over 3 years and have never had a problem with it.  I've taken a few thousand photos with it!I also have a Nikon D-500 and a Panasonic Lumix Mega Zoom. Each has it's own unique features / abilities so I also have a good point of reference.You do need to spend some time learning how to take advantage of it's features. The image stabilization can be turned on or off.You need to make sure when you take a picture that you have the dial in the correct position.  If you have hit the Macro button for close ups you won't get a great photo of objects at a distance. On the manual mode you can do a lot of programing but you need to understand how that willaffect your picture. The visual aids on this camera are wonderful. I would suggest you leave them on to help in getting the right settings.I most recently took this camera to Scotland and used it while sailing on a grey day with wind and rain and it took some great photos with no blurring.Don't go cheap on the Memory Stick Duo/PRO Duo which you have to purchase separately and make sure it matches your camera.As I said this camera has performed well for 3 years and I have no complaints and highly recommend it.
