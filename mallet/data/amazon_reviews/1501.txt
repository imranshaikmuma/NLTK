a much more fitted shirt than the ones from the school uniform company--that's why I put that I thought it ran a little small. It fits nice just know that it is not loose around the body it is somewhat tapered and fitted. My daughter wore the same size as in the other brand  (kids 6) but most of her play clothes are a size 5. These are super inexpensive compared to the uniform store and seem to be of a similar quality. Great for the chocolate milk dribblers in your house!!
