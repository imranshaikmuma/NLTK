I'm sure you'll read lots of specs about this camera in the reviews so I am going to talk about it from my perspective.  I am a massage therapist.  I use this camera to vlog about products and techniques.  Since I do all my own filming it's nice to have a camera that tracks my movements amazingly well.  It's nice and light to carry.  I get great quality video from it.  I also can plug in my mic and record sound with my video.  This camera comes with so many options that make your life easier in post production.  You can shoot time lapses slow motion etc.  People complain about no 4k but I don't care.  I'm not a filmmaker.  I'm a massage therapist that uses photos for my website marketing material and youtube vlogs.  This does the job perfectly.
