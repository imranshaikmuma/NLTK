I need size XL-Tall in T-shirts. The two I find work best for me are the Eddie Bauer Classic and this one. The fit is equally good on both but the Carhardt fabric is a bit heavier. In colder months or cooler climates (meaning just about anywhere but Phoenix) this isn't a problem. In the Phoenix summer? Problem.I don't really like the pocket but it's useful at times I guess. Gives Carhardt somewhere to put their logo which is still a bit of a status symbol while in certain company.Great durable shirt at a good price. Just have some lighter ones for those 110-degree days.
