We used this for a new home construction time-lapse project. This Brinno lasted 7 months in the snow rain and summer heat. There were no issues with leaks. Although we don't think it needed one we changed the battery once (just in case) during this entire time span. We had this set at 15 minute intervals during the daytime. The only issue we had was maintaining the foliage that was growing around the pole we installed this camera on. Though it was entertaining to see the leaves growing over the camera view. Highly recommended for any time-lapse projects.
