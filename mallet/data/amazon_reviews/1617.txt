Have used on several pairs of shoes so far and have had zero problems! I got the "boot" protector this time because I wanted something heavier-duty than the regular Suede Protection (though it worked fine too... but this IS better protection). I've used it on purses too and on a suede blazer.Make sure to follow the instructions completely and let the suede dry fully. I also suggest that you get a couple good brushes both for cleaning your items up when they get dirty/wet as well as the Suede cleaner.Definitely recommend! If you take care of your things they'll "thank you" for it by lasting and staying in good condition!
