I am very disappointed with this shirt and am returning it without even bothering to try it on.I own this exact shirt in this exact color that I have owned for several years.  My older shirt is made of much heavier fabric than the new one I received today.I read a number of other negative reviews here that mention the Haiti manufacturing facility as being the source of the poorly made shirts and low quality fabric.  From what I learned today about the Ash color XL Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt I have to agree.I purchased two of these shirts.  One Ash and one Black.  Both are inferior to the Ash colored XL that I currently own. I'll list the facts which confirm to me the poorer quality of the fabric in the new version.My original Ash colored shirt- Made in Honduras | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 424gm/15ozNew Black colored shirt- Made in Guatemala | 100% cotton | Weighs 402gm/14.2oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.New Ash colored shirt- Made in Haiti | 99% cotton/ 1% polyester | Weighs 384gm/13.5oz is slightly larger and was weighed with tags and stickers still attached.The fabric on the Ash/Haiti version was very coarse to the touch and practically see through when held up toward a light across the room and is immediately noticeably thin.The fabric on the Black/Guatemala version was ok but not great and I hope it softens up in the wash.  It blocked a fair amount of the light when held up but was still noticeably thinner than my older shirt.My Ash/Honduras version is obviously softer after years of washing but blocks most of the light when held up and feels thick and substantial.I am returning the Ash/Haiti version because it is such poor quality and had it been my first ever Carhartt shirt I would assume that the brand was over-hyped and made crappy workwear.I will keep the Black/Guatemala version and wear it around for a while before deciding whether or not to keep it or send it back. Regardless both of these shirts were a big let down and the quality is not what they used to be.Both of the newer shirts ran larger than sized and even with all that additional fabric as compared to my other shirt still weighed in at 1-1.5 ounces lighter even including all the cardboard tags and stickers.FYI: After many many years buying from Amazon this is the first review I've ever written. That should tell you something about how negatively I view this product; Carhartt Men's Workwear Midweight Jersey Pocket Long-Sleeve T-Shirt.
