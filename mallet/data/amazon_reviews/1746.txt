I ordered these in a L Tall. I'm 5'9" and usually wear between a 12 & 14 closer to a 14 and they fit perfectly. I've been rotating through 5 pairs one for each work day of the week for 6 months. They withstand washing exceptionally well don't shrink up in length seams are strong everything is holding up beautifully! And they are very comfortable. I will definitely be sticking with Koi.
