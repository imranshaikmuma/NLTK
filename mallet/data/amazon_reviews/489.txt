Well I decided to get another Sony Cybershot since my other one got stolen. I am not sure of the model I just know I bought it a couple years ago. It's pretty much the same quality as my other. This camera does best with animals and outdoors which is fine because I mostly take pictures of my dogs parks and then pictures of family&I. The low light pictures are good however they do come out blurry. The camera takes excellent pictures on flash no red eye and actually really makes your eyes pop if you have blue or green eyes. The one thing I don't like is on the top the wheel to change the settings it's super tight and chips my nail just to turn it. I feel for the price I could have gotten an older Cybershot and got the same quality pictures it DOES have some lens flare... but overall it is a good camera and does exceedingly well on automatic. I have attached pictures in my review of pictures I took with the camera.
