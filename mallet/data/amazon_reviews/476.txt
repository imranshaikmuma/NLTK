This is a truly fantastic compact camera with capabilities and performance that far outshine most smaller cameras of its type.A little background: experienced semi-professional photographer here used to shooting with a full-size pro-level DSLR and pricey lenses.  I wanted a camera that was simpler to carry on off days for personal trips and just keep on hand when not working and not carrying the big camera rig.  This seemed to fit the bill and I've been extremely happy.  Image quality while not *quite* the same as my DSLR is nonetheless stellar.  I've been recommending this to anyone who asks - the performance is truly awesome.Downsides?  Well of course - first it costs a lot more than many compact cameras but the performance is another category entirely.  If you want a budget camera this may not fit.  If you want a reasonably priced camera that can produce pro-level images with less hassle - this is that camera.  On a similar note it's a compact camera....but there are certainly other cameras that are significantly more compact than this.  In it's fully-off and lens-retracted state it is still relatively thick and the weight is more than I expected before I received it.  For me none of these are dealbreakers and if you want amazing image quality you can't get it much smaller than this so that trade is worth it to me.In short - great image quality full manual control variability in control setup solid build a great viewfinder awesome lens and nice clear screen.  What's not to love?
