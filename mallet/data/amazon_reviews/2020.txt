I purchased this Chromebook for my daughter right before Christmas. She loves it and never had a problem with it until a couple of days ago when all of a sudden its operating system disappeared. I followed all the instructions on the screen and tried to get it to work. After I tried to fix it at least five times (and nothing happened) I contacted ASUS. They could not fix it over the phone and recommended that I ship it back for repair. Customer service was very good they took care of all the shipping labels and ASUS is paying for the shipping. I'll update later...keeping my fingers crossed hope it gets fixed.Update: Asus fixed the chrome book and shipped it back to us within a couple of days. It works again!
