This laptop started out amazing all the specs and hardware listed was working as advertised and it was doing everything very well performance wise. And then the dreaded GPU issues started kicking in that I had heard about on some other reviews on here it happened right after I updated my drivers and the GPU has been barely functioning ever since. I have tried every fix under the sun so it is definitely defective hardware. The laptop is now getting returned to Amazon for a refund since it went BAD AFTER 2 WEEKS OF PURCHASE. How is that even possible Asus? These 1050's seem to be plaguing other users on gaming laptops also after the 378.66 driver update. Good luck with this one guys.
