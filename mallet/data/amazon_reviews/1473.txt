I repair appliances and spend much of my time on my knees.  Our company provided uniform pants tended to rip at the crotch so I've been looking around for a better pant. These have survived longer than any pair I've used with no obvious loosening of the seams or other unwanted changes. The color is near perfect.I do wish that they had a opening or vent to insert pads into the double knees. However there is a solution since they have double knees. I cut a small horizontal slit in the inner layer of knee material near the top and was able to slip a rolled up square of neoprene between the layers then unroll it. So far this has worked great and allows me to remove the pad when worn out.
