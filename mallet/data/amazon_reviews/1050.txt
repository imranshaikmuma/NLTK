These leggings are hands down my favorite skinny black pants. I got my first pair of them on a clearance rack 2 years ago at an irregulars-type department store for $9 and I now have 4 pair.Yes I have worn these tights to yoga - but more importantly I've worn them EVERYWHERE. They're a perfect legging fabric - opaque thick but not bulky great quality warm without being too hot AND DID I MENTION OPAQUE?! Curvy ladies I am a 12/14 and I think we have all experienced "the sheen." You know - when your leggings are too tight/thin and you get that iridescent look that is your skin showing through? These leggings have none of that. I can comfortably wear shirts that don't TOTALLY cover my hips and butt - like tshirts!! - without any fear of the dreaded see-through butt effect you get from so many other leggings.The tummy control top on these is THE way to go; they shape and fit your curves really well and don't roll down at all!!! I have a legging addiction - over 60 pairs from LuLaRoe to BlackMilk to lululemon to Danskin to you name it - and these are my everyday go to pair. The only issue I have with them - and it is minor - is that sometimes the only ones I can find at the store have a logo on the back calf which everyone thinks is a sticker and tries to remove. However the ones I've ordered from Amazon don't seem to have that issue anyway so problem solved!
