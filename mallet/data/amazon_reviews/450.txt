Purchased this camera to take on a Florida vacation.In terms of construction and toughness - we used it in the salt water at an ocean beach in Miami several hotel pools and had no issues with it. The camera held up against everything we threw at it including my 9 and 5 year old kids =)The pictures we got off the camera were actually surprisingly awesome. In daytime light the pictures are great. In the water things also were better than expected. Lower light situations the camera seemed to struggle a bit but that might be to be expected for a camera in this price range.One feature I like playing with is the time lapse feature. It's pretty interesting to set up an interesting scene and let it capture for a while and then see what you get in the end.
