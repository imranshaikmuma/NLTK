I love these shoes. As soon as you put them on your feet you feel like you're walking on clouds. I have scoliosis and back problems and have started working so I needed to find a good pair of shoes. I ordered these because I read that they provided comfort and great support for your feet and back. They do the job. They are however bigger than I expected. Reviews said they run small and to order a size higher so I ordered a half size higher and they are still pretty big.
