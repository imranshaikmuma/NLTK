I really like the style of these pants.  I had purchased an XS several years ago but they were a little bit short.  I'm 5'6" 123lbs size 0-2.  These pants fit fine in the waist (drawstring and elastic) but are quite large and actually a bit too long!  My legs are kind of big and muscular for my size but I'm still swimming in these pants.  Overall I do like them a lot though and they look just like the ones pictured.
