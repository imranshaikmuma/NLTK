I have a service job and it has me on my knees a lot which as consequence leaves me with sore knees and worn fabric! I have been through so many pairs of pants in my line of work and well I'm tired of it to be completely honest. I purchased a pair of these pants two years ago and they have weathered the storm that is my occupational hazards in champion compared to other pants of this price point. The double knee lining adds the extra comfort I had desired for so long and finally in triumph stands up to the ill-mannered intent of the unnecessarily treacherous depths my career regularly entails. These pants are the definition of comfort in darkness of the endless rotation of 10-hour shifts that punctuate my time on this earth. The convenience the cellphone pocket brings to my daily routine cannot be qualified in words alone perhaps it should be best expressed as a color which I would be inclined to say--in opinion of course--is a green hue polka dotted with a translucent purple. In all honesty I wake up excited to wear these pants to have them support me and to have the validation and confidence boost that comes with knowing that I am the only thing holding these testaments of human ingenuity erect. These pants are my partner; they have my legs (quite literally!) and I have theirs.To anyone questioning these pants I insist you should have no doubt; these are the pants you are looking for.
