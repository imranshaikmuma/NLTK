There are 3 divided pockets on the right side (may not be deal for lefties) with a net on the inside of the largest pocket for even more organization. I put my lancets here so they're easily accessible and don't roll around my pockets. The left sided pocket is one large pocket with multiple elastic bands for even MORE organization of pens penlights or a scissor. I can't emphasize enough how handy these pockets are when you're a nurse! Highly recommend. Regarding the fit I'm 5'8140 lbs and the small fits well with room to spare.
