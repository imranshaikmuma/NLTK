A nice step up from my D7000 and before that a D5000.  Great low light performance color rendition hand feel controls a huge boost in MP's...I cant think of one negative thing to say about it.  Well actually I did discover that I need to get Lightroom  Creative Cloud as Photoshop does not support the raw images from the D750.  That was a bummer initially but Lightroom has so much more to offer than Photoshop so that was a good move looking back. I did a lot of homework before I made the jump to a Full Frame.... yes I lost $ on some lenses that would not be compatible but dont regret my decision at all. The photo's that I have taken are far superior to the D7000.  I did also look at the D7200 and D610 but decided that this one is a better choice(although the D7200 was close I had a hankering for a full frame and the D610 was not much less $$ than this one) for what I feel would be the best fit for my photographic needs.  Everyone's needs are different mine were for Landscape photographyLow light photography as well as some macro and a little wildlife photography.  I wanted to take some great photo's but (sometimes) do not feel the need to get all anal about it.  I do occasionally suffer from gear acquisition phobiaMy best source of photography information comes from a web site known as Photography Life.  They have done a wonderful job of not only giving great reviews on this camera and lens they also have great tips on photography as well.  This lens by the way Rocks !  Its replaced my Nikon 18-200 as a walk around (DX does not work well on FX bodies).  I love the extra f stops and by cropping I dont really feel sad about the loss of reach either.
