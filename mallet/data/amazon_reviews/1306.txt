This brand was stumbled upon to find better workout clothing for the gym other than Walmart. This is my first time with the brand Tesla and found that the prices are equal with Walmart but the quality is far better. Like any other pair of shorts there is a lockstitch style at the waist line that is reinforced on the inside. The non-abrasive fabric is stretched section by section to keep it together giving it more reinforcement and better contour of your body. (This is much better than a 1 section piece of fabric). I'm 5'11" 160lbs with a 30" waist and 24" thighs and purchased the medium size compression shorts. Once I tried them on they were a tad snug and had to break them in for a day while at the gym. They held up very well and gave comfortable movement throughout my workout. (They will show your package). The great part of these shorts was the quick dry wicking material which kept me cool during the workout. As for washing these shorts I recommend you put them with like clothing (polyester or spandex) on low wash and very little detergent. Do not try to dry these in the dryer just hang them up to air dry which only takes about 30 minutes on a hanger (This depends on where you live.) Overall I give these compression shorts two thumbs up and will stick to Tesla. Now I have to try their compression shirts.
