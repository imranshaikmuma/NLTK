I've gone through 3x Nikon D700 and 3x Nikon D800 bodies over the past few years. All my bodies have been through a lot and I can pinpoint what's wrong with the D800 and how Nikon failed to capture the essence of the now legendary D700 with the way they danced around not releasing a real successor.I set my expectations super low when I heard about the D750 release and I was throughly unimpressed when I read through the spec sheet - first noticing the consumer level command dial which I would honestly never touch after switching the M the limitation of shutter speed capped at 1/4000 and for them to further cramp the focus points towards the center which is quite inferior to what it was if you ask me.I received the camera today and put out my Df D800 and this new D750 to compare.First thing I noticed is the grip... boy it's lightyears of improvement comparing to the D800 which I struggle to hold on to every time I use it.  The D750 grip is very similar to the D700 and if anything it's actually better.  They now give you enough space to lay your thumb and made a little bulge to improve palm grip. They have also rearranged the battery compartment so that the grip itself is smaller allowing your fingers more surface area to hold the camera.  I know most people wouldn't care as much but when you continue to use the camera over and over this is the type of little things that makes a huge difference.Live view response time is dramatically improved comparing to the D800.  The refresh rate isn't near the Df level which feels instantaneous but it's fast enough; the real difference is how soon your camera allows your input again after taking the first image with live view.  The D800 is so bad that it feels like a bug they never fixed it takes up to a few seconds for your camera to come back to live; whereas the D750 is simply very responsive in this department.The tilt screen actually feels very solid and this makes the D750 a great camera for those who shoot both still and motion.  I've been hoping this feature would make it to the professional bodies and this might just be it.Initial response with image quality is very positive even after living with D800 for the past couple years which spoiled me with the amazing dynamic range.  They somehow seem to have improved that even further with the D750 which I have to say is mind boggling. The slightly lower 24.3 megapixel vs 36 from the D800 is actually a welcoming "feature".  I have to say 99% of my pictures don't ever call for a full 36 megapixel so a lower 24.3 which is sufficiently almost all the time will save me so much headache with storage space.  (I have added a total of 10 hard drives over the past 2 years thanks to shooting D800 as my primary cameras)*** updated AF section ***The auto focus performance on the camera is far beyond the D800.  Not sure how well it is in comparison to the D3S and D4 yet but it's at least pretty close to the D700 besides not having the focus point coverage. In low light situation even with my ISO jacked un to 6400 it's focusing just fine; and also when I try to point the camera towards direct sunlight it's still not missing much at all and I can still rely on it.  On a contrary when I put it in live view it's actually failing to focus sometimes which the camera has no problem not using LV to focus.  Strange but so far so good with AF...Instead of CF+SD combo this body actually has 2x SD slots.  It's not a deal breaker but if you're concerned about SD reliability you may want to keep this in mind.The button layout is similar to the consumer level camera but still retains enough similarities to the bigger brothers so the pros wouldn't feel too unfamiliar.*** video portion of the review to come after thorough testings this week ***The new movie settings menu is a very welcome addition which would allow those of us who shoot video much easier access to the functions.  Nikon seems to also have given us more flexibility to customize the buttons for movie mode as well.Wifi is definitely a great addition.  This opens up new ways for us to use our cameras allowing us to instantly extract photos out of the camera and manipulate or distribute them with our cell phones.  I sincerely hope that this will continue to trickle down to the entire Nikon line of products.They stuck with the EN-EL15 so we don't have to buy new batteries - awesome!*** The bad:  AF focus points are cramped... this is a huge set back and I was really hoping this wouldn't happen.  At this point it seems like Nikon is set to designing their future cameras like that which is a step back.*** The maybe:  This isn't a professional line of camera although it feels very good and feels just like the pro bodies but it's not. The omission on 1/8000 shutter speed and the consumer level shooting mode dial is a huge put off for a lot of people but then the above par construction makes up for it.  Now whether this camera is durable enough like its bigger brothers remain to be seen.  But so far I have to say the D800 isn't very durable.  I've got the AF knocked out several times on my bodies in the past without apparent impact already so I'm keeping my fingers crossed hoping they did not cut corners on this one.Conclusion: *** update***  I'll admit that I was skeptical actually very skeptical.  But after using the camera for one whole day on two weddings shooting both still and motion I have to say I actually look forward to using this more than my D800 bodies.  I can't say about the D810 but if I never needed the 36MP I don't see why I should go that route.  The wifi feature works beautifully and it sets the camera apart from the other cameras.  60fps on 1080p HD is quite impressive although I haven't figured out how I would use it.  The high ISO performance is amazing... you will see some lab tests results soon online and I'm sure it won't disappoint.  The grip is amazing and I really cannot stress enough how well it is designed.  Huge props to Nikon on this one finally listening to our complaints for once.In short this is not your D700 replacement but it is probably even more than you had asked for.  It's a slightly more compact D700 with a tilt screen 24 MP wifi still solid construction. The downside I see is minor issues like the layout of the buttons where WB is #2/5 from top down and ISO is in #4 and there is nothing to indicate them other than the writings meaning there are no engravings or anything to help you distinguish what you're pressing when you're not actually looking forcing you to pull the camera away from your face and see what you're pressing and that slows you down.  Movie mode highlight zebra is great but it would be even better if they put in focus peaking.Will I buy it again? Yes!  In fact at the time of this update I have sold both my D800 bodies and switched over to two D750 bodies.  I think every era of cameras there's just one amazing camera that's really worth buying - back in the days it was the Canon 5D 5D-mk2 D700.  Those are the bodies that people always go back to compare to because they set the standard in their times.  The Nikon fans have always been asking for a D700 successor.  This even thou isn't a direct descendent it's definitely worthy to be ranked among one of those very few DSLRs that in time you will go back and compare to and years from now you will be asking Nikon to make a D750 successor.Hope this helps you make your camera purchasing process!
