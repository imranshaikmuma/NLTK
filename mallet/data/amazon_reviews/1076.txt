I had recently ordered the leggings in khaki and had liked them so much that I decided to order more. I was disappointed when I first saw them because of how small they looked but upon trying them on I was surprised at incredibly stretchy and soft they were.  Not only did they look good but they felt good also  The one size fits all is a perfect fit. I'm 5' tall 165 lbs and wear an X-Large or 14/16 so  most leggings in this size are too small and too long bunching up at the ankle. I will definitely order more of these in the future!
