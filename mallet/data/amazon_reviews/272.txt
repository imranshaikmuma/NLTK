The plate screws don't stay on the plate.  The retainer clip fell off of one.  Also within 2 weeks the clips on the screw hooks broke.  I replaced them with small carabiners and it works fine.  Product is inexpensive and you should expect relatively inexpensive performance.  Replace the hooks and watch the screws so you don loose them.  Also make sure you have the straps locked down well with the plastic locking blocks.  It came apart on my first use because I didn't check this.  This may be my fault but it should come safely assembled out of the box.  So ya decent rig for the price if you watch the above.  You get what you pay for.
