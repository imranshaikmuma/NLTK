Great phone for $200.  Use it for work and play.  Been using it over a week and zero issues.  Setup was easy.  At home put SIM card in from old AT&T Samsung phone and within an hour my apps and contacts transferred over. Wife's Samsung Galaxy 6 is very comparable.  ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser is a bigger screen finger print security and just as fast without the $20 a month contract.Pros:Good Battery life. (12-14 hours heavy usage)Easy to setup from old phone.Camera is good.Opens apps fast.Screen is clear and bright.Call quality is good.Text Facebook Outlook email works exactly the same.Finger print scanner works great.Cons:No lights on the home button.Limited accessories.Lots of preloaded ASUS apps but some are very useful and hasn't slowed down performance.Very well made fast as advertised and great alternative to flagship phones that cost 2x or 3x the cost.  This family will probably never buy a phone from a cellular carrier again.
