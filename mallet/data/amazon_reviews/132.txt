This is a great beginner camera! for the price i think you get a great image quality and many features that will help you grow as a photographer.  I love the functionality of the flip out screen which is larger and more sleek than the canon models.  when I was searching for a camera I was debating between the canon and nikon and ended up with the nikon d5500.  in my price range this camera had so many more options and I love the build.  this camera is a great deal as it even comes with built in wifi (which would cost $40+ extra to get on any other camera that lacked this feature).  with in camera wifi you can download the nikon wireless mobile utility app and use your phone as a shutter remote! you can get great quality photos with this camera without breaking the bank.  it is a great body and you can invest in good glass to enhance your photos.  perhaps the only downside I can think of is that it is a crop sensor but at the time when I was a beginner and I was looking at cameras I had no idea what that meant.  if you're looking for a full frame sensor then skip on this camera but if you are not sure what those terms mean this camera will get the job done.  I do recommend to upgrade your lenses as soon as possible  do not stick with the kit lens forever.  personally I love the 50mm f1.8. don't be afraid to get our of your comfort zone and get our there and start shooting! :)
