I purchased this laptop after much deliberation. I am the opposite of an impulse buyer; this purchase was years in the making. I am not disappointed. The 13.3 Samsung notebook 9 is currently the lightest 13.3 that is available and while not the thinnest it is still very slim. I believe the reviews for this laptop are a bit misleading. While offerings from Dell and Asus receive negative reviews due to poor quality control and faulty hardware most of the negative reviews for the NP900X3L are due to software issues that are largely beyond Samsung's control. This was of no concern to me anyways as I am a GNU/Linux user. Mint 18 is great on this laptop.
