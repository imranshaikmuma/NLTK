This is a wonderful camera. I'm a doll artist and I needed to take cleaner detail photos of my work.  This camera did the job beautifully! I can't believe it. When I was taking pictures of the doll art I was working on the pictures were so detailed that I had to lotion my hands really well because the camera showed how dry my hands were. I love that this camera!!! The camera looks traditional and professional but I know looks aren't everything.  What was included with the camera are batteries a USB cord which works really well with my MacBook Air.  It used my iPhoto as the way to down pictures.  It also included a strap and projective cap over the lense. You'll need to by a SDHC memory card. The camera has a nice heft to it But even with that weight  I can still take a picture with one hand while trying to take photos of what I'm working on.  I am an amateur at cameras but I know what I wanted my pictures to look like and this camera did that for me!  Just fantastic.
