This little camera is great! it was easy to connect to my wifi. iPhone & iPad viewing work well. Good quality video & time laps photos. Night vision works great too! I did take off 1 star because it's not water proof (so it can't stay outside) it does work through a window make sure you have night vision off if you place the camera against glass because the red light will make your video solid gray. Against a window w/the outdoor lights on works great for night viewing. I'm happy with it & I purchased a 2nd camera shortly after receiving the 1st because I like it so much.
