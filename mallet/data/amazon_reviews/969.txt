I really like this phone.  It's fast and does everything I need it to do.  I am a heavy cell user : emailing  texting  shopping online  YouTube etc... (Everything except game playing) The signal is great & that says a lot bc I live way out in the country.  (My old cell  LG G4 h815 couldn't hold a signal out here but my Nexus 4 & 5 could) I'm able to use the Hotspot connection as well  but only bc of a tip from another amazon review -  you have to insert the sim card & count to four  then immediately turn on your Hotspot & it works.  If you do it too soon or late  it won't work &  I'm on cricket wireless network  on the unlimited plan. The phone gets a little warm at times but not any more than any other cell I've used.  The turbo charger works awesome - charges faster than any other charger I've used in the past.  So far I'm pleased & pleasantly surprised.
