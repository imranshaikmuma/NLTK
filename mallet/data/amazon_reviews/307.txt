This camera has a lot of potential. It's exciting to put 360° camera in the hands of consumers. I have a few things I really love about this camera and a few things that have room for improvement. I will start with the pros: 360° video capture high quality picture capture compatibility with both iOS and Android free software from Richo's website for video processing simple to use and setup easy remote access to camera via smartphone. My main list of cons would be: low video quality (especially after it's uploaded to youtube) no expandable memory (you're stuck with 8 gbs) built in battery (video transfer's to your phone are slow and drain the battery) and very strict recommendations to charge/recharge the camera via a PC usb port (although my iPhone charging brick does the trick). If you can live with this list and pros and cons it's still a great camera!
