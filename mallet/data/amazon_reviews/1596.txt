I must start by I LOVE THESE SCRUBS ! With that said I have tried many of scrubs. We all work hard in our scrubs so I need lightweight with some sort of stretch that do not slip off my hips after adding something in the pockets ! I LOVE THESE SCRUBS...i have washed them with no shrinkage and wow no ironing. You can wear them right out of the dryer and have a professional look! Pockets are deep and roomy . I would like to maybe see a Velcro tab on the back pocket so I could feel more secure about placing Money or credit card. As for the fit . I am 5'2 and weigh 128 and a small petite fits fabulously ! I do not wear my scrubs tight...they are roomy but not dumpy! I love these scrubs and you will too!
