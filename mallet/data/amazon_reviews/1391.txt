The Go 3 has more padding on the inside of the sole as well as on the bottom of the shoe and inside the heel; the foot "sits" a little higher as a result than it does in the older Go 2 version. It's not a bad redesign just different. The padding offers more support and was comfortable out of the box for a 5-mile walk.
