This is my first time buying a DSLR and as someone who is relatively new to photography/videography I'm impressed with how quickly I've been able to learn the ins and outs of this camera. The kit comes with plenty of materials that helped me get started and I couldn't be happier with the results I've gotten. I'm still learning the techniques but I'd say this is a great DSLR to start out with and it can be used equally well in the hands of an amateur or a professional. I've included some untouched photos that I've taken for anyone who would like an idea of the types of images one can capture even at a beginner level.
