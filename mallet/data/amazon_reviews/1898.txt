It's good. If you're looking to hold you off for a few years so you you set your stuff straight this I think is your computer. It gets you the most bang for the smallest buck. 1000gb of storage? big ass 15" screen? HDMI and (idk off the top of my head) 2 USB ports? Which I think is enough. It works pretty fast and it comes with a graphics card. I actually play Overwatch on this computer but on low settings. A little glitchy and not as fast to respond sometimes but I get to play so I'll take that. I think a big con for a product being produced and selling now is that the keys aren't backlit in other words the keyboard is not visible in the dark. A light will fix that but it would've been more convenient to have it there. I will admit the mousepad is a little weird as well. I like buttons but this mousepad is like the Apple Macs which are just plain. I use an external mouse not a big deal. It doesn't come with a lot of ads or bull downloaded in it so it's fast right from the start unlike this toshiba I bought before had. Overall it's a steal
