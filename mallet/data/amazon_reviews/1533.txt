I have just received the four sets that I ordered--black khaki teal and pink. I wear a size XXL and the fit is perfect not tight not baggy. I am glad that after reading a few reviews  I did not order a size down. From reading the reviews it appears that the smaller women have the issue of the sizes running large but the plus-size women find the sizes to be true to usual fit. And this is what I have confirmed with my own plus-size purchase. The fabric is only a little stiff but I find the stiffness keeps the look more professional. I washed before wearing and the scrubs held up nicely colors not fading. I like the elastic in the back of the pants to supplement the drawstring in the front. Nice purchase for the money. The only reason I am not giving five stars as a rating now is because I need to see how the scrubs wear.
