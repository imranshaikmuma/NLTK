I ordered these to make work as a mechanic more bearable in the hot months. I'm wearing these now having received them just under an hour ago.The new fabric is stiff but not scratchy or uncomfortable. The thickness is nice; they don't feel like they'll tear easily. The loose fit is very convenient for kneeling crouching sitting etc. The hidden metallic zipper and buckle are typical of most industrial clothing but it's well executed (none of that nonsense where you have to do a button hidden in a pocket just a simple hook fastener). The pockets are spacious and the cell phone pocket is appropriately sized and should fit even the largest of mobile devices (my co-worker's iPhone 6 plus fits perfectly although sitting or kneeling would cause it to fall out).After a couple washes it should soften up. Time will tell if these shorts will actually put up with the abusive environment they are designed for.Note that these belt loops are designed for thinner belts made for industrial work wear. Typical belts tend to be about an inch or so thick; they won't work in these shorts.
