This was everything I was looking for! If you are a gamer and use an XBOX One they both can be synced together! it was very easy to setup and start using it right away! I have had this laptop for about a week now and still love it! I have been using an apple Mac for so long but this laptop is awesome! The battery life can range anywhere from 5 hours to 8 hours depending settings and usage honestly I don't pay attention to the hours remaining i only look at the percentage remaining.
