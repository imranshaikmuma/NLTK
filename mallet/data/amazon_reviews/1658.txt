I've worn Skechers for the past couple of years as they fit me well (albeit a half-size up) and are very comfortable. However when I started going to the gym and walking on a treadmill my feet hurt constantly due to the Skechers I had not being supportive enough. My husband had the men's version of these and told me I should try them as they were thickly padded and very supportive. I ordered a pair. At first I wasn't sure. They were very hard compared to my other Skechers. They fit about the same but they weren't comfortable at all. But from the first time I wore them to the gym I was in heaven on the treadmill! I can walk for miles in these on the treadmill which I can't do with my other Skechers. The support is amazing. After a few days the hardness wore off and now they are my go-to shoes for the gym. If you need firm support and can get past the initial stiffness these are definitely for you!
