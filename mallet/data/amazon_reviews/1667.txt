I usually wear a 2XL and unfortunately I have been feeling a bit constricted in 2XL due a recent expansion project in my waistline.. But I ordered a 2 over a 3 anyways.. It seems pretty big on me. I would imagine it is built that way for layering under work shirts and thermals. Also due to the stiff nature of the fabric the sleeves kind of hold a ROUND shape instead of the fabric falling which even makes it look bigger. I imagine after ready the other reviews that it wills soften and shrink a bit.. I am 6'4" so I ordered the tall 2X as well as the reg 2X to see which one fit best. The reg fit good but It came down right right to my belt line. Any kind of movement outside raising my arms resulted in my stomach area being exposed. The 2XL tall is about 3 inches longer and I feel works better for tall people to avoid wind getting up under the jacket constantly.I have only worn it once outside with nothing but a t-shirt on underneath in about 55 degree weather and was sweating to death lol. So It does work well so far
