Feels great on hand(you'll understand when you go at your camera store and try one). The buttons are on the sweet spots where you could easily press them while taking pictures. Only use PSR on tripod. Weather sealing is great. Works well with vintage lenses. Live view is great. The built-in shake reduction works really well for me. I generally prefer built-in geo tagging(depends on what you shoot I shoot street and landscape)than the flash cause I never really use the built-in flash. This camera is best for outdoor photography(hiking beach street forest wildlife etc) and it doesn't give a damn about the weather. Durable body you could shoot with this camera all day. (with extra batteries ofc)
