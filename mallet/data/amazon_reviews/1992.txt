Bought it solely for showing videos in a Children's Sunday School class.  Works fine for that purpose.  The battery stays charged more than long enough to accomplish the mission.Wouldn't recommend buying it for a heavy-duty replacement for a Desktop PC as the processor memory or disk isn't sized for that kind of usage.
