It is very comfortable and falls very nicely on my body. Unfortunately I cannot wear it to work (I'm a teacher) because my bra shows on the side when I raise my arm. I suppose I could wear something underneath but it would've been nice if that were built in. The price is great for the quality and the availability in a lot of colors is also a plus.
