I ordered the first phone 2 months ago. That phone now will not charge. The second phone or replacement phone I ordered a month ago. That phone refuses to connect to my unlimited data plan or wifi. I know I need to return one if the phones to the company but at this point I'd prefer a total refund. I'm using the first phone to do phone things and the second phone to charge both the batteries for the first phone. I bought this phone knowing it was an American company and hoping for better results than anything I've had in the past. Instead it's pushed me far away from ever buying this type of phone again. Highly unrecommended.Update: it's now January 2017 and I've had the phone 6 months. I've used protection on it and suddenly the battery won't charge or the screen turn on. It's just like throwing $150 on the ground and being totally screwed.
