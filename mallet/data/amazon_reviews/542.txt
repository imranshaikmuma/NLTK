I purchased this camera in March 2016. I used it in May at Stingray City in Grand Cayman no snorkeling but it did get wet. It takes fairly good pictures and is easy to use. The rubber grip on the front makes it easy to hold and the operation is simple. Fast forward to June. I was attempting to take pictures of grandchildren in the water. Keep in mind this is only the second time I have used this camera. I took just a few pictures and the LCD screen went black. I couldn't see what I was shooting which made the camera useless. I did get a few pictures by just blindly pointing the camera. But it was a big disappointment.  When I came home I opened the compartments expecting to find water but all the compartments were dry. I turned the camera over and water came out the disp. button. I have mailed the camera to the repair center and I will see what happens. I won't purchase another camera like this ever again. It wasn't an expensive camera but way too expensive for having been used only twice and getting just a few pictures.
