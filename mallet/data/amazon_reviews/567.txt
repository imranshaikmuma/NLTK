Right off the bat it bears mentioning that this camera chews through standard disposable AAAs like my pregnant wife with a tub of Baskin-Robbins.However once I loaded it with a set of 1100mah rechargeable batteries I got a serviceable life out of it though I would advise having spares on hand.The image quality isn't outstanding for all-around use but it shines at its intended purpose underwater photography. Picture quality is good though not outstanding.Durability is a strong point for the unit I gave it to my adorably clumsy 7 year old daughter for photography in our soaking wet Oregon forests. It's been through multiple drops onto dirt rocks and fallen tress with no signs of damage. Holds up to pouring rain well in situations where you wouldn't feel comfortable pulling out a smartphone or point-and-shoot it's a perfect stand-in.The interface is a bit lacking but to be expected for the cost.As far as VIDEO is concerned I prefer to pretend it doesn't exist as the video is low quality with atrocious audio though that's really not the main selling point so it hasn't impacted my use negatively.My daughter loves the front-facing screen for 'selfies' and so do I as it's made her 'selfies' look less ridiculous now that she can see herself.Overall I'd say its worth the eighty or so dollars I bought it for given that it has survived much more than a similarly-priced point an should would have at the trade off of features and image quality.
