I have bought these Lee Women's Relaxed Fit Straight Leg Jeans for years and they have been wonderful and fit me perfectly.  In my most recent purchase I bought two pairs but each a different color.  What I discovered is that the cut of the jeans have changed drastically!  The darker pair of jeans fit as all my other purchased jeans fit but the lighter pair (Azur) fit awful!  The new cut dips down significantly in the back/butt and so literally will not stay up in the back and are embarrassingly almost showing my butt!  The waist used to fit high up at the natural waist in the back and the front but no longer!  The labeling on both pairs was identical the only difference was the color but in actuality these two pairs were not anything alike and fit totally different.  Why is Lee altering a classic fit that has been in production for YEARS and selling this new cut/style as if they are the old style?  This new fit is terrible.  Oh and don't even get me started on the difference of the stretchy fabric Lee is now using!  So disappointed!
