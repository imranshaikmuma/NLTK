Great waist trainer! (especially for the price).  Not that I have tried any other waist trainer before but based on the fitness gurus online this waist trainer meets all the requirements for top quality (multiple boning that is flexible yet durable breathable yet firm fabric strong hooks that are spaced  an inch apart and the correct vertical length).  I measured a 32" waist when I first purchased mine and I bought a size Large.  I started in the first row of hooks.  Don't get discouraged when you first try to put it on.  I had to lie on the floor on my back and my husband had to hook the hooks. I almost decided to give up.  I hung in there though.  After the first day I could stand and hook the hooks myself. Your waist starts to conform after 24-48 hours. Now only 2 1/2 weeks in I'm down to the last row of hooks.  Although I have not re-measured my waist I plan to order the medium in a week or so.I decided to start waist training because I could not get my "diastasis recti" closed and back in place after child #4.  Diastasis recti is the separating of the lower abdominal muscles that happens during pregnancy to accommodate the growing uterus. Because I always carried children low in my abdomen my diastasis recti grew worse with each pregnancy.  As a result I had a huge "pooch" and some pretty severe back pain.  Only 2 1/2 weeks into waist training and my pooch and back pain is severely decreased (without the waist trainer on).  I started doing planks and other ab exercises during week two.  The combination of the waist training and exercises is going to save my waistline.  So glad I did a little research and discovered the healthful benefits of waist training.***Note*** I do wear my waist trainer daily for 8-12 hours while at work and whatever else I'm doing.  Now that it's fall/winter I can conceal it pretty easily under clothing (I bought the black waist trainer).***Another thing*** Wear a thin camisole or undershirt underneath your waist trainer so that the boning does not injure you.
