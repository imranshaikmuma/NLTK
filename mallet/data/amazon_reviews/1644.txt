I've had the bistro ba talk in graphite which is on the right side of the picture. They fit larger than a normal size 8 shoe roomy fit still comfortable and feels very well made. Comparing it to these black ones from Amazon the shoe is smaller than I expected since crocs advice to order a size down but I ordered an 8 in women still and they fit perfectly. These are a lot lighter than my batali edition. It is also narrower not roomy fit. I can barely feel the nubs on the foot bed. It also says  made in Vietnam vs the batali which is made in China.These are a lot lighter though & still pretty comfortable. The material is also a lot softer than the batali which is weird because they are supposed to be made in the same Croslite material.
