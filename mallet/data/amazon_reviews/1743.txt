I purchased these pants for an 80's dance that I was attending. I am 5'-9"  and wear a 12-14 . I love wearing cargo pants. I have large thighs and there's usually more room in this area with this type of pant.. They are also very comfortable and the material is quite soft. The length is indeed long so I love that the "tall" is actually that. (Even at my height they cover the heel but don't drag on the ground) I also have quite a round/full bottom so I love that these pants keep this area covered when sitting or bending over. I will probably buy more colors to wear them for everyday..... So comfy!!
