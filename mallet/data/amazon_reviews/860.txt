Bought this unlocked so I could use Straight Talk and was a little worried that it would be refurbished wouldn't work with straight talk or be some weird International version. Well I have had it almost 6 months and it works wonderfully synced up to Straight Talk with no problems at all and is exactly as I hoped it would be at way less in price than the stores. In fact this is the second one I have bought as I also bought one for my daughter over a year and she also sings high praises.Great purchase!
