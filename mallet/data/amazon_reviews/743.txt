I personally hate leaving bad reviews but what the hell CyberDime?My last order of a unlocked Iphone 16 GB was perfect in every way until I dropped it in the ocean. (My Fault)So I figure let's order from them again and get the 64 GB since I loved my old phone so much and for about a day and a half everything was just peachy couldn't be happier.Then this morning it decides "Hey! I want to die right.....Now!" and the whole screen won't slide anymore. I can't even turn it off or even slide to unlock. Still turns on (Thank god for Touch I.D.) oddly Assist touch works all the physical buttons even the headphones too. Leaving me completely confused.The screen isn't damaged or even looks out of the ordinary but I can't slide nor select any apps.The only positive note is when it died I was on my Kygo playlist so I got that going for me which is nice.TL:DRPhone was perfect for about 36 hours then the screen won't respond to almost anything luckily It still plays great tunesEdit My badIt came back to life after I bled out the batteryJust a tech scare is all
