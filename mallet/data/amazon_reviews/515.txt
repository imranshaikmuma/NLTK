Great travel camera! This is the best "all in one" camera on the market right now. The improved image sensor in this model provides stunning image quality and excellent 4K video clips. I had the original RX10 and really liked that camera. However this latest model blows the original away in mage quality and lens performance. The 24 - 600 zoom has an incredible focal length range that allows for detailed close ups from quite a distance. The images have excellent color dynamic range and contrast straight out of the camera. The camera is pretty easy to set up. The price is on the high side but the image quality is almost equal to my 4 year old full frame Canon DSLR. The only downside is that you can not make deep crops of the photos you take the picture quality goes down in a hurry. But if you don't crop your images the quality is awesome.I highly recommend this camera for all forms of general photography especially if you need extreme telephoto coverage. This would make a great wildlife and birding camera without getting into the expense of a DSLR. I recently returned from an awesome trip out of the country and came back with photographs of a quality that previously would only be available hauling a full frame DSLR around.
