A great phone at a superb price.I bought this from Amazon to use on Tracfone's Verizon network. Had to go to WalMart to purchase their $10 sim BYOP activation package.I needed to  transfer from one smartphone to another. Setup on Tracfone was a breeze and the phone was active in less than 10 minutes.I went for the cheaper of the two phone options so it includes the Amazon apps but they were easy enough to get out of the way even though you can't uninstall them. Compared to the bloatware Verizon stuck on my Edge 7 the stuff on the Moto is pretty minimal.  Android 6.0.1 so plenty of stuff to customize the screen has nice touch sensitivity and the resolution is just fine. Tried a couple of quick snapshots with the camera and that looks like it will get the job done.This will be used by a disabled person for casual and emergency use so phone and text were the two biggest items.  There's over 11 gbytes open after the OS gets its bite out of the 16 gbyte system memory so just in case I ordered a 32 gbyte microSd card. I also ordered a case and screen protector; total for the sd card case and 2 glass screen protectors was less than $25.  So for less than $140 she has a phone with no payments that will cost her maybe $120 a year on Tracfone's plans.Calls are very clear and the default text app is very straightforward.  The phone this replaced was Tracfone's own LG Rebel which was an abysmal phone.
