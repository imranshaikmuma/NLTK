Got this to replace my old Carhartt hat that I lost. That was my favorite hat ever.This color isn't available in the women's version so I got the men's hat. It fits just like my old hat there haven't been any changes in quality and it's as warm as ever. I think my old one may have been a slightly different color but the color of the new one is fine and it matches everything. The colors are off in my picture but it's one of the legit ones... can't fake Carhartt quality. These hats are practically perfect.
