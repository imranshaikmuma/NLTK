I have numerous pairs of these scrub bottoms and like them very much.  I have worn a small tall (5'10) for years.  This pair and a couple of pairs I have tried from other sellers were longer.  All sellers currently advertise them as a 33 inch inseam.  Not so from a nurse who also does alterations.  That was accurate for my older ones but the pairs I have tried in the past year are 34+ which leaves them too long.  Interestingly enough the inseam is listed as 34.5 in some spring 2015 catalogs advertising Koi products.  Just be aware.  They fit as expected otherwise and are durable with a bit of shrinkage.  Too bad I can't wear them anymore regular inseam is too short and the current "tall" drags on the ground.  Might still work for those who cinch the bottoms but I don't.
