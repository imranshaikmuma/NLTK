Posting under my husband's account. This was my first experience purchasing clothing online and I was quite nervous about it. I'm 5'4" and generally wear a size 10 and have a large bust (D to DD). I bought a Large and it fit me well and was quite roomy. It hung perfectly not clingy at all. The fabric is very soft. I paired it with a blanket scarf. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
