I've been using the laptop for several weeks now.  I like it.  I wish I'd paid attention that it was NOT touch screen.  Would have preferred . . . BUT for those who have voiced complaints about sticky/whatever keys/etc.  I found it took a few days for the computer to adjust to my touch/ or more likely me to adjust to its response.  With a little use the keys issue vanished.
