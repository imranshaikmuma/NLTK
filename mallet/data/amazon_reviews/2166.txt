I was looking for a laptop that could use the Elgato screen capture device as well as play games have a nice wide viewing angle screen lighted keyboard and have a 1060 Nvidia but not spend over $1300 either.  This is the only thing I could find around December 2016 that fit my requirements.I returned a 4K Dell 960M based laptop (to Walmart) after it broke within an hour of operation (video chip issue).  I like HP Omens but found that this model was a better deal.  I also tried an MSI GL62 but the screen was not great (limited angle and washed out) and sent it back.I have been using this Asus for everything and can run a bunch of programs at the same time and no issues.  I do video editing as well and there are no issues and I am surprised at how fast this renders the final output.  There is no touch screen and it is only 1080P (the Dell screen was 4K and looked really nice) but this is fine.  I have 16GB of memory and see no need to expand it at this time.  There is no m.2 included however I plan to install one for the OS.  The Dell (that broke) had an m.2 and was super fast in booting.  The 1060 is great but the machine will kick the fans into high gear when you push it.  It gets a bit loud but not too bad (better than a couple of HPs I have).  Heat is fair but it does get warm when those fans are needed.Overall it is a fine well built and good working machine.  The weight is acceptable and the thickness is average.  The screen has a nice bright display with good viewing angles.
