I bought this on january 20th and finally opened it on the 29th (I was away but delivery time was on time).First I would like to say that this laptop is amazing it has great build quality a good responsive trackpad and handles games in a great way.However like I read some other reviews while first using this laptop I had a problem with the GPU drivers and would get an error code : TDR failure that would reboot the computer every half an hour. I looked for help online and saw an update made to GPU drivers of the nvidia 1050ti on january 24th I downloaded the new drivers and uninstall the old ones and everything seems to be working fine so far.UPDATE:Turns out I have been playing games with my Intel HD graphics card and there is a code 43 for the Nvidia GPU display.I would hope that ASUS handles this GPU driver issue in a better way as I have seen I wasn't the only one experiencing this.
