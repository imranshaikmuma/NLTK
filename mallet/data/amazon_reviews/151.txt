This is a great camera. I have one.HOWEVER...beware that this bundle comes with a lens that is non-VR.VR stands for Vibration Resistance.Unless you plan on taking still shots with a tripod and remote then the lens will prove itself useless to you.To hand hold a camera with a non-VR lens produces images that look out of focusThat's because it is impossible to hold a camera without your hand having some degree of shaking/movement.I recommend spending the extra for a VR lens.In my opinion I think that manufacturers should make it clear to consumers that non VR lenses have limited functionality.I have known a few beginners who have put money into their cameras/lenses not knowing the significance ofthis and so disappointed that their photos aren't crisp and focused.
