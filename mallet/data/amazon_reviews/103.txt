What a great camara. I love the fact that it can be used it auto mode or manual. I use the manual mode while my wife likes the auto. Picture quality is fantastic and because of the high resulution enlargements retain the clarity. I have received compliments on some of the pictures the short time I have had it. Great camera for the budding photographer or someone whose hobby is taking pictures and does not want to spend alot of money.
