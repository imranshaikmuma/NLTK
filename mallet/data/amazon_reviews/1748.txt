Great lime color bright but not dayglo.  Pairs surprisingly well with other scrubs I have as well.  Bought to go with the Leaf Print Koi Top in Medium.  Awesome match!  Only one cargo pocket on right - wish the pants had two as I use the LEFT cargo for my pens but I can adapt well enough.  Elastic waist without much give in it but also has useful tie to pull up the slack.  I don't use the bungee pulls at the ankles because I'm 5'9" and need the length.  Purchased the M size (I'm 125lbs) and have room to spare but I like freedom for bending etc.  They don't look ridiculously large but are roomy.  Could probably get away with a S but I don't like anything remotely snug.
