I am 66 years old and have buying Carhartt work clothes for most of my adult life but not anymore.Their quality which used to make them a favorite with working people everywhere has disappeared.Their Pocket T-Shirt looks good washes well fits great but does not last.I have found that over the past several years that neck material in all the shirts I have bought only lasts a fewmonths and then it starts to fray.  The body of the shirt is well made and wears well but the necks are so crappy that I amstarting to look at other brands to buy.  If I am going to throw a shirt away after only 6 months I might as well startbuying cheaper ones.It saddens me to have to write this negative review and until Carhartt goes back to making top quality products once again I'mafraid I am now an ex customer.
