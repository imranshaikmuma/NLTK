I have purchased other shirts from MBJ that were sized differently.  For this shirt choose your normal size (as expected).  I tried to size down and the shirts were too small.  I am 5'9"/160/36 DD and purchased a Medium.  I really needed a Large (the medium was too small in the chest sleeves and stomach.)  The return cost is at buyers' expense so be aware of that when you buy.  Also the "jade" color is not as pictured.  In the photograph it looks to be a teal-based green.  The item I received is more kelly-green based.  The quality and cut of the shirts are great and I will be buying the Large size in other colors.  My normal shirt size is a Large.  Hope this review was helpful.**Update.  I received the Large size and they fit great in the shoulders and chest.  The Large is however still pretty snug in the waist/hips.  I have a 30" waist and 40" hips and you can see the top of my jeans through the shirt.  If you are pear-shaped or have larger hips I would suggest to size up.
