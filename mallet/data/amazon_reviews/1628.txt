This is the problem buying clothing online. You try to read the reviews to find out but even then they can be wrong. Purchased them in 36wx32L and the size said it was that HOWEVER it's not!! Much smaller all my jeans even new ones r 36 however with These Carhartt ones I need 38w so I am sending  them back and waiting for the new ones to see ill update after that. As for everything else  Very smooth feeling not rough at all seems a little light not sure how they will stand up but im willing to find out. The price seems inline with everyone. Ill update more once i have the new pair and wear them for a while
