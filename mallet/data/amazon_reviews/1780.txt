Okay I bought these for me and I'm not a man so sue me haha! I buy them for wearing under sweaters in the Fall and Winter as the white is a nice neutral color and it keeps wool from making me all itchy. I love the Hanes t-shirts because they hold together for a LONG time don't fall apart in the wash and they keep their size so I don't have to worry about them shrinking up on me. I also love the 'tagless' feature that keeps me from scrabbling at the back of my neck because of an itchy tag corner.
