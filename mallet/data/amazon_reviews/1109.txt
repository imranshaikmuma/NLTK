its a great fit .. I am 5'3" - 150lbs and medium was perfect fit for me .. not see through and good flexibility.. i have read about the muffin top thingy and yes if there's any extra pound it might form one .. but if it's not something major then you are good to go.. ! Oh and the design is good too!
