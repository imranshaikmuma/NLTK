These are by far the best scrubs I own. Once I purchased a pair I won't try any other kind. They fit true to size and have a flattering fit cinch slightly at the waist. The fabric is high quality and can by washed and dried without shrinking or loosing color. One more amazing quality is the wrinkle resistance - I have left these in the dryer unfolded overnight and able to pull them out and wear them without many wrinkles. As an Occupational Therapist I am very active and squatting/bending/running all the time and these scrubs have "give" but look structured and professional. Highly recommend.
