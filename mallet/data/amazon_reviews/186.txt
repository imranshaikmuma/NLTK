Great Camera! I'm switching from an old Canon 5D that broke after years of use and I can say I'm impressed with this camera. The camera is small enough with the kit lens on it to throw in any bag or a jacket pocket. Yet when you throw on the EOS M lens adapter and you have the ability to use some of the best lenses in the world. The seller (Beach Camera) made the camera even better with remarkable service!
