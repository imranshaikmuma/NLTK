As a plus size woman I struggle to find scrub pants that are a good comfortable fit. These are usually a pretty easy fit. In most jeans I wear a size 20 or 22 and the 2X in these pants is a nice comfortable and slightly roomy.I wear 2X in most of the Cherokee Workwear Core Stretch pants and they are usually a more snug fit. Comparing to another brand the 2X has a similar fit on me to Koi Lindsey pants in size 3X.These have been a go to pant for years for me.Pros: the price the roomy fit.Cons: no stretch no cargo pocket and they tend to wear down easily where my thighs touch while walking.
