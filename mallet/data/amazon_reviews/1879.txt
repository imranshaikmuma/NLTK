After 2 months of use I can't complain about anything. It starts extremely quick and I am able to play many demanding games with no problem as well as just getting my assignments done. It looks pretty professional with no flashy gaming led lights or designs so it's great to use at work or school and yet still have pretty good specs to play some games with no problem.
