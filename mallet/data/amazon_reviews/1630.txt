I own several pairs of these pants and generally speaking find them to be pretty nice.  They are mid-weight with a fairly nice fabric (nice dull evenly colored twill not shiny or stiff).  They are best for early autumn - spring I personally find them a little warm during the summer.  Several people have commented that they fit small and to size up in the waist.  My own experience has been pretty consistent that the actual waist fits well but as someone with fairly muscular thighs the legs are on decent but slightly on the slim side (I wish they were another 1/4-1/2" across each thigh when measured flat). I like them because I actually wear them both in an office setting (I removed the hammer loop and wear them with oxfords and sweaters) as well as in the shop setting (wood working and welding; if/when I ruin them they are cheap enough to replace without much worry but last well otherwise).
