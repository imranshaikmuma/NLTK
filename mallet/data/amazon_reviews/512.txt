I've bought and used practically every super-zoom "bridge" camera that's come on the market in the past 10 years looking for a "grab and go" option to my DSLRs and assorted lenses.The list includes Nikon Canon Panasonic (Lumix) Fuji etc.Although I have questions about the mental health of the persons who designed the internal menus...and wish it had phase detection focusing...the new SONY is hands-down  the winner in overall quality and utility.That Zeiss lens is simply amazing! At comparable resolutions the image quality is nearly indistinguishable from my Nikon D810 with pro glass!
