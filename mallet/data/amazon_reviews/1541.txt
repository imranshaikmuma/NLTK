I love ASICS shoes & have owned many pairs over the years.  I always wear a size 8.5 in this brand.  My current shoes have worn out & in looking for a new pair I didn't think I'd have any problem purchasing the correct size.  Imagine my surprise when they arrived & I could barely get my feet in them!  I checked both the box & the shoes & they all said 8.5.  On the upside the box came with a return UPS label & the return was easy & credit was given right away.  While I'm very happy with the vendor I was very disappointed with the shoes.
