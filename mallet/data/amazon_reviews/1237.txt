I hike a lot so I wear socks out quickly. I decided to try these Balega socks out because a friend recommended them. These socks are so soft and thick. I love the way they hug my feet!I like the way these socks stay in place without slipping around in my shoe. The socks stay comfortable during a long hike because they wick out moisture.I wear a size 8 -9 shoe so I ordered a medium. I am pleased with the plush feel of these socks.I haven't had them long enough to see how long they will last.They are a maroon like color. They are made of Drynamix polyester 84% ply idle nylon 14% Elastique 2%.I do like these socks and I will be trying some other colors to match my shoes.
