I have owned many Canon DSLR cameras over the years and I loved this one so much that I sold my 1D X.  Lightweight great image quality fast focus acquisition great high ISO image quality...really good tracking for BIF.  I could go on and on.  Mated up with the 100-400 Mk II it's a killer combo.  I shoot with friends that have the "pro" bodies and long prime lenses (like I used to) and find that I get just as good if not better shots than they do.
