I just got this laptop a day ago and so far have not had one issue that anyone else has had with it. I started it right up and have been gaming with it since and honestly does not get warm or hot and is even quiet while playing. I really like all the Asus utilities that come with it are very nice and let you control everything from fan speed to clearing up memory. It lets you monitor heat source and all spots of heat on the CPU and GPU. I hope to have this laptop for many years and I will say if you are one of the people who have had a issue with your laptop I would say to give it one more try and swap it for another one. It is a great system and all BUT the only ONLY thing I wish was different was the case. My monitor case feels like it is made with steel but the rest of the system feels like hard plastic but looks like steel. Overall I highly recommend this and say for the price you will not get anything better.
