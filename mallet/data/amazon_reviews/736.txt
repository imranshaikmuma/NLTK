I have bought many phones within the last 5 years. Obviously some are better than others. I have to say that I have become sort of an experienced Android phone purchaser. I have purchased Android phones from low range to mid range to top of the line . I am so impressed with my Huawei Mate 9. It is absolutely a top notch high range Android phone with a mid range price. Not too much bloatware (very little) super responsive I have not run into any glitches whatsoever. Did I mention that the finger print scanner is super precise. I love this phone no hype. It's a great phone at a great price.
