These crocs run a little big so you should buy 1 size down.  I work in a kitchen and these really reduce the fatigue on your feet.  I've had my current pair for two years and they're still going strong.  The last pair I had worked great until I left it in my car on a hot day and they shrank and completely deformed.  The non slip works great unless you get the bottom gunked up with a bunch of flour.  The shoe material doesn't give much airflow so the shoes can begin to smell after a short time.  Cleaning it with rubbing alcohol or baking soda and water seem to keep the smell away though.Pros:extremely comfortableeasy to slip on and offeases feet fatiguenonslip works greateasy to cleanCons:lack of airflowno ankle supportwill shrink and deform if you leave in your carsize runs a bit large
