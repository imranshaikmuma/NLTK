Although other reviewers have posted about how fragile this item is I ordered it hopeful that my order would arrive in good condition. The product itself was packaged well and I didn't see any viable signs of it being crushed or mishandled. However soon after opening the base of the re device already shows some damages. This makes it pretty much useless as a waterproof device and also guarantees the crack from opening up even more over time.I tried the camera and while I can live with the mediocre picture quality the wifi connectivity is unreliable.I really wanted to love this device and am disappointed by its poor quality. This should never have made it past the production line and any good manufacturing company would have done its due diligence to do some drop tests before it launches to market. I know because I work for a major HW company and we launch products all the time. Suffice it to say I'm not buying another HTC product ever again.
