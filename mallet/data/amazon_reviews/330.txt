Pros: Nice quality for a digital. Very good zoom. If you know nothing about cameras this will serve you well. Just point and shoot. I almost never have to use the flash (very good quality in low light). Captures the image very quickly. Does very good quality video. Wi-Fi works well with the phone.Cons: the view screen is not touch screen. Wi-Fi to PC is difficult to get working so some will have to use the USB to transfer images. You have to go to Cannon's website and download software for windows.
