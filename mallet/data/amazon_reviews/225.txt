I've had both of the predecessors to this camera--the SX20 IS and the SX 30IS.  The new processor in this camera really works where those were 'iffy'.  Stabilization is excellent even at 840mm (equivalent) and the pictures are crystal clear with minimal chromatic aberration and fringing (means they are sharp and relatively undistorted).  The burst mode is fantastic--you can shoot up to 8 frames at 10 frames per second with this camera and it really works the way it is supposed to.  It even uses the programmed settings and will do exposure bracketing in burst mode.  My only complaint is that the zoom framing assist button (which is the same as the one on the SX30 IS) is placed where your thumb would normally be so it is difficult to shoot without inadvertently pressing it which is why I didn't give it a 5 star rating.  The zoom framing assist button itself is very helpful because it is difficult at full zoom to find a fast moving bird in the frame so it allows  you to back the zoom off temporarily until you can re-acquire the image and then zoom in to shoot it.  Picture quality is excellent with the new Digic 5 image processor often rivaling the quality of pictures I've taken with my DSLR.  This is a great all-around camera that although it is not pocketable is small enough and light enough to take anywhere.
