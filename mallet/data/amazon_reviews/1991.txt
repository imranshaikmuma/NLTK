It's here! My new HP laptop arrived via UPS this afternoon and I've been tweeking the day away installing programs changing settings and putting all my Favorites back in EDGE browser thankfully I wrote down all my favorites on a piece of paper as a reference point so it was just a matter of locating all the websites on BING. I'm pretty Happy with the LAPTOP only things that bother me are 1- it's got no BLUETOOTH and 2- on the ad it shows that it's got 2 USB 3.0 and 1 USB 2.0 but it's actually 1  3.0 and 2  2.0 and also the 3.0 input isn't Blue as in other Laptops or PC's. Overall though the price was low so it's worth it. If one just wants to browse the web read e-mails see some movies and play some simple games then this is the Laptop to buy.
