I recently purchased 2 maxi skirts and wanted a form fitting (but not skin tight) top to pair with them.  I am 5'3  have a wee bit of a "paunch" (I'm working on THAT one!) and not one to flaunt my upper arms except at the beach....in my bathingsuit... up to my neck... in the water!  (Yeah I'm working on that too!)  That being said I read the reviews for assistance in which size to order.  When not a form fitting top I'll order a M.  In this case I figured L would do and in white.  It arrived earlier than expected.  Immediately I took it out of the package and tried it on.  I LOVE this top!  It looks and feels fabulous and fits very much to my liking. I can pull it up so the shirring is more around my belly making it appear smaller (yaaaay!).  The sleeves are a perfect length and when I lifted my arms and you can't see up the sleeve. The material is like that of a stretchy tshirt.  AND best of all it's made in the good ole USA!  It's ok if it's a hand wash/line dry.  It's worth it and the price is right too!!  I just ordered it in Black and Purple just before I wrote this review!  Thank you MBJ!
