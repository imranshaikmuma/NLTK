I stepped up to this camera after shooting with a Canon EOS Rebel XS for a couple of years and I couldn't be happier. What I like most is the articulating LCD screen which I use frequently when shooting in Live View mode. When shooting a fast prime lens wide open the depth of field is tight and focus is critical - I use the LCD in Live View zoom in on the target make a final focusing adjustment and the result is perfect every time.The Canon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens is my everyday lens on this camera and although I like the range from 18 to 200mm it's a pretty slow piece of glass. Two things help compensate: 1) The lens' image stabilization and 2) The camera's high ISO & long exposure noise reduction technology.Dislikes? The only one is a delay in writing data to the memory card when shooting RAW + large JPG mode with noise reduction turned on. It essentially doubles the image write time regardless of the speed of your card. So a 10-second fireworks shot will take 20 seconds to be captured & written to media.I'd buy the body all over again but I'd save for faster glass.
