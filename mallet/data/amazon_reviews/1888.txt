The unit works very well for what I need. A computer that easily travels and connects back to my main computer. However I can only give it 3 stars because what I got is not what was advertised. What was advertised was an Intel Dual-Core Processor 2.16GHz. What came was an Intel Celeron 1.6 GHz. I was expecting a bit more power.That said the feel is good while typing the screen is readable the construction is solid.Does have one minor issue. The Micro SD periodically disengages. I saw this listed in other reviews and is not a big deal for me. I just reseat it and go on.
