I usually wear a size L top but I read the other reviews suggesting to order up and I'm glad I got the XL (38DD). The fit is flattering.  The fabric is soft but it is very thin; I'll need to wear a tank under this shirt. It arrived with a small hole in the fabric near the bottom of the elastic shirring; it looked like it was knicked with a scissor when someone cut away the thread. Very disappointed in the lack of QC.
