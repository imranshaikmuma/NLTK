Bought several styles of Carhartt pants from Amazon to try in my size.  I expected some differences in fit obviously as the different styles were advertised as having their original loose or relaxed fit (from roomiest to skinniest).  Still I was very surprised that the pair of these that I received was extremely tight and much much smaller than the other styles.  Hopefully I just got a fluke because as I write this about 71% of other reviewers said they thought it fit true to size.  My experience was that would only be true for hipsters who want skin-tight and constricting pants.  I sent these back but did keep some other Carhartt relaxed fit pants in the same size.  Go figure.  Aside from the fit the fabric was indeed much softer-feeling than any of the other styles I tried on account of it being washed twill.  As for thickness and stiffness it was reasonably good not as thick and stiff as my jeans or some classic Carhartt B11's but not as thin as dress pants.
