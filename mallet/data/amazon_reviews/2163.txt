This laptop is a real Beast. I moved from a dying Inspiron n5110 to this it was quite an upgrade.I have always had a good experience with Asus so I thought I'd invest in this laptopas far a build materials I like it and I don't know why others thinks that it is cheap plastic but bear in mind that this is the first quality laptop I ever bought so I can't really compare it to other brands or models.Pros:1- GTX 1070. the GPU can take any game thrown at it easily.I played: Arkham KnightWitcher 3Battlefield 4 and more. all maxed out without a single stutterbe also informed that I render some games at 4K and then downscale through nvidia supersampling.2- blazing fast SSDI have over 50 programs installed and still it boots up like the day it has arrived. I have Android studio SQL serverVisual Studio Adobe PS illustrator ...etc and many heavy programs installedthese are the things that are SUPER and not just good.cons:1- 60hz monitor. the GPU capabilities is way beyond running ANY game maxed out on 60hz on 1080p it is a shame that it wasn't at least 90-120Hz2- the back is a fingerprint magnet. while I don't really much care about this aspect but there are some who do. no matter how you do there will always be fingerprints at the back ALWAYS.3- trackpad right "button". it is quite confusing sometimes it works just fine and most of the other times it doesn't respond at all like I never clicked anything and I have to do the two fingers click.Summary:I am a guy that a 1700 USD are fortune for and worth months of saving. and I am a very heavy user that requires as much as a machine could offerI use it for gaminguniversity programming running multiply virtual machines at once ..etcit only required putting another 16GB RAM stick and all is good. I would totally recommend this investment and it is worth every penny.
