I might have made one review before but I wanted to talk about this phone.  I got it today put my AT&T sim in logged into my Google account and transferred everything to this one.  So far calls have been good and clear.  Picture quality I'm happy with.  Screen size is great  I'm coming from a Galaxy SIII.  Phone is more responsive than my last one.  I do wish it had an octo core processor but for the price and 3 gig of ram I jumped on it.  We shall see how I feel in a month but for now I'm happy.
