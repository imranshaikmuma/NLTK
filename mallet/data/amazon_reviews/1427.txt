Lee jeans used to be my go-to jeans.  I ordered 4 pair and split 2 of them in the rear starting at the back pocket the 2nd time I wore them.  The two that did not split yet already have a small hole showing that they're going to split soon.  I'm 6'2" and 170 lbs - I do not fill these jeans out by any means.  The material is simply too thin for any kind of durability.  You can see light through them when you hold them up to the light. You should not be able to split any pair of pants by taking stairs two steps at a time.  My Walmart Wranglers are a far superior product.  I regret buying these.
