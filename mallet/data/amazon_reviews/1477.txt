These are soft and I love the bright color (I ordered light blue).  After washing them once I am finding some strings beginning to fall out.  I'm hoping nothing begins to unravel but I'm handy with a needle and thread if that happens.  I don't mind that so much because they are so cheap.  I don't love the big breast pocket on the top because it looks more masculine to me but it's not a deal breaker.  They have a more baggy look to them but again for a cheap pair of decent scrubs I think these are just fine.I am 5'8" and 170 pounds and a size Medium fit me well.
