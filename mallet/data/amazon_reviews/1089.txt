SIZE DOWN.... just to give you an idea-I wear a 10-12 pants- depending on- stretch make etc.- 30" waist 40" hips. I wear a 12 dress. THANKFULLY I read LOTS of reviews and I bought the medium- FITS LIKE A DREAM!I probably could have worn a small- I NEVER wear small.The medium is very comfortable. After trying on- I stretched the waist and hips as far as I thought would be comfortable on someone's body and it stretched 7 more inches so this has STRETCHABILITY I would say!After wearing- my advice would be this-**If you wear a 16 and over order a  size large: wear a size 12-14- small size 16  order medium: wear a 10 and under order small.I never in a million years thought I would buy this but I bought 'one of those' cute 1950 floral dresses inexpensive and this really adds a lot. I think these are so cool for anyone to buy and they are not just for costumes!
