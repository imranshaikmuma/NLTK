I was very disappointed with performance.  I have owned many Nikon cameras without problem.  the shutter was slow to respond I missed many shots. Focus was difficult. I couldn't get panoramic to work kept saying failed.  WIFI connection was null could not get any connectivity to any of my devices doesn't connect to the computer via USB either.  this is just a few issues.  now i am trying to return for a refund and only option i get is to send for repair.  I want a full refund not a repair.  It should have worked right out of the box it was not a refurbish purchase.  I would not buy this camera again. I received the 'repaired' camera back - still doesn't work.  I want a full refund guess now I have to contact AMAZON by phone to make that happen.
