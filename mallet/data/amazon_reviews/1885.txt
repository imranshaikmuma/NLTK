I really really liked this laptop: it does all the basic functions (email internet browsing music word processing that kind of thing) and is the inexpensive light-weight computer with a long battery life that I wanted. I noticed it was a bit slow with video playback but that was manageable.However about a month after purchase I started having issues charging. First it wasn't charging at all - no light no indication by the computer that it was plugged in etc. I hard rebooted it and it worked for a bit but now it seems unable to gain a charge. As in I'm stuck at 47% for the next millennium. If plugged it it doesn't lose charge but doesn't gain either. And the computer continues to read "01 min to full charge". I've tried rebooting it again different outlets chargers troubleshooting etc. and nothing seems to help. In googling battery problems with Lenovo N22s it seems I'm not alone and many many customers have had similar issues charging and even powering on their computers. If you're in a position where you're okay with dealing with Lenovo customer support and repair services maybe it's worth it but as a person traveling and living abroad with limited electricity this computer has turned into a massive headache. I cannot recommend for people who expect a reliable computer.
