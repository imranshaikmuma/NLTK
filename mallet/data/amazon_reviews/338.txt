I am a professional photographer and I love collecting camera's and lenses ( about $ 40k) invested in to it).  So I was eager to receive my recent order of a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 - but to be blown away by its performance and quality - who would have believed you could get the equivalent of a $1000 DSLR for less that [$]?My main purpose in ordering this camera was to have a digital camera that was light easily portable and (most importantly) had a viewfinder. I have severe presbyopia and would be constantly taking off and putting on a pair of reading glasses to see the screen of my Samsung which was usually visually obscured by the ambient light of everyday outdoor shooting. This camera solves that problem as I hoped it would...but I discovered it could do so much more. I couldn't have imagined it possessed so many extraordinary features normally associated with only the most expensive DSLRs. Hand-held night photography? Check. Extreme macros? Check. In camera special effects? Check. And a zoom that has to be experienced to be believed (Check my photo in middle). Focus on a distant feature that literally can barely be seen from your current position and then slowly zoom out until you discover that it is so far away that in the full wide position of the zoom it has disappeared completely! Even has a "hidden" ability to make time-lapse video in the MINIATURE setting. Take pictures in reduced sizes for social media use or go full-blast RAW for Photoshop lovers. Be sure to download the full users manual PDF file for a course in this cameras many many features.To the cameras amazing feature list  add an exceptionally protective and handy carrying case with internal straps that allow the camera lens to be cuddled by the case and leave room from the neck strap as well...and I scarcely need to mention that the kit comes with a 16GB high speed SD card. I am a confirmed addict of Amazon and this cements that relationship once again. I am SOOooo happy.
