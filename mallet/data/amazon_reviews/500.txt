Bought this for a trip to a waterpark - it worked great!  No problems at all. I bought some Duracell Quantum batteries for it (it takes 2 AAAs) and they lasted through two days of picture and video-taking and are still going strong. You do need to buy a micro memory card for it as well. Was very durable we took it down slides and swam with it underwater quite awhile. Then our son played around with it afterward at the hotel pool taking photos and videos as he jumped in over and over.  I was so impressed at how well it functioned never any issues with it. Photos came out nice as well although I can't really give a good review of those as we were just taking pictures for fun not for documenting underwater wildlife or anything. The photo I'm putting on here was taken with the medium-quality setting but there are higher-quality settings as well.
