I don't think it looks cheap at all as some people stated. The directions are awful and not helpful at all. I ended up using SmartWear app downloaded from play store. I have a Galaxy Mega the first large cell phones with a 6.3 inch screen that I purchased in 2013 and still works beautifully. I purchased 8 smartwatches for this Xmas as gifts. I have been reading the comments trying to see if anyone has found a solution for the IPhone which three of the people I gave this watch to have. I gave 4 stars because some of the items on the phone does not operate like the web browser and how do you just put in your sim card and make it work Daaaaaaa! not getting it. Also I accidentally got it to Sync to the BT app lol! I think it would be a great watch if someone would put up a video on how to set it up and make all features work on any phone. Boo on you IPhone you just want people to only use your products with your phones RIGHT! I really like the look of the watch!
