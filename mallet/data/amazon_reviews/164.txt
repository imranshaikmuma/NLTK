Pictures say it all.  This camera can do anything my full frame cameras can do and I like it better.  Im a pro wedding photographer who covers about 40-50 weddings at my current rate.  This camera is essential to my workflow.  I can do great shots with much less global editing.Pros- Pro Quality- Lighter than my DSLR- Smaller than my DSLR even with a grip- high fps- AMAZING jpeg files-easiest camera Ive ever owned when it comes to shoot in full manual and not accidentally messing up a shot.- best wifi experience of any pro camera I know of- can print directly from camera with instax eich my brides loveCONS- low light focusing can be kinda slow or miss but its the best mirrorless Ive had for low light focusing.- need battery grip to do long eventsAll shots attached are jpegs straight from the camera
