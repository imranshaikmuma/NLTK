Great shirt for layering. Comfortable and a good thickness.  I was hoping that it would be a bit longer than it is.  I'm 5'10" and prefer a shirt that's longer in the body.  From the image here it looks longer than average though it would be difficult for me to tuck in for warmth.  Otherwise great top and I'll wear it frequently.
