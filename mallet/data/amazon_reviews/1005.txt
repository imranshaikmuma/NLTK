I really love Blu phones because of their prices and quality (not big deal but good enough). This phone looks beautiful. I specially love size the camera and screen quality but I don't recommend it at all. This phone comes with charging problems. Just had it for about a month when it started to not even recognize the charger and when it used to it didn't charge more than 40-50%. I had it plugged in for more than 12 hours and still did not charge to 100%. It was a waist of money going to Blu products' workshop and still the phone is having issues. I went online and it seems to be a common issue with this model. Totally disappointed.
