It's not even passed one month and started giving problems . I have activated finger scanned lock so when I am not using it I lock it with the button which is on the right side on the edge or the power key if that's what it is called  so after that when I unlock it at the time when I want to use  sometime it doesn't work means like it is unlock and I can see what's I. The screen but I can't use anything like when I am texting someone the cursor can be moved but the texting pads the alphabets it stops working . Then again I have to press the power key again to lock it and unlock again then it comes to normal .  And one more thing I haven't received head jack with it
