I love these socks. I didn't realize how little my feet were breathing until I tried these socks.I am a socks guy and I have dozens of fun/funky/stylish socks that I usually enjoy wearing. Ever since I have bought these socks I wear these much more often just because how comfortable and well-circulated my feet feel compared to my other socks.In comparison to my other "athletic" socks these socks blow them out of them water in terms of how comfortable they are. I do not own any of those socks that cost $15 per pair but compared to the standard athletic sock these are amazing.I bought these about a month ago so I am not sure how durable these socks are. If the durability is abysmal I will appropriately lower the rating from a 5-star product.
