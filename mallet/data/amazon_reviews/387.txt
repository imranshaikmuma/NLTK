UPDATE: Still love the camera. Amazon sent me another (with a strap brand new!) Great product great customer service. I was going to delete my comments about my first order but I think it's important to know how Amazon responds when something isn't just right and I appreciated the help. Great videos great photos! Buy this camera!I love this camera (have an older version) but I have a concern about the condition. It came with photos I didn't take on the internal memory. I'm not sure if this is a reconditioned camera and I'm not sure how to contact Amazon about that.  It also didn't come with a wrist strap (as advertised.)Pros: The lens is awesome. It takes great photos and great videos. Great resolution.Cons: The flash isn't great but I don't expect a huge flash for a point and shoot. The door to the battery is a little flimsy (again I knew what I was ordering.)It's a great camera and takes great photos. My only concern is why someone else's photos are on this camera!
