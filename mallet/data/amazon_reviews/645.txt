A great entry/mid level smartphone for anyone wanting a versatile decent quality phone that doesn't cost several hundred dollars (true there are plenty of better phones available for more money but this one packs a lot of bang for the buck).  Great screen resolution.  Decent camera.  Good selection of pre-installed apps (I actually like the Prime Video Kindle and Music apps already loaded and ready to go) and it doesn't come loaded with a lot of useless bloatware.  The lock screen ad is unobtrusive -- it's there when you first turn on the phone but one quick swipe and it's gone and you're at the home screen (you won't see another ad til next time you turn on the phone).
