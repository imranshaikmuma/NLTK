I brought this phone abroad with me for a few months because it was unlocked and I didn't want to risk having my more expensive phone stolen. Overall this phone for a backup is a pretty good choice. It works decently and has a good battery life. The reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 or higher is because this phone has so little space for apps on it. You can add an SD card and I added a 64 gb one thinking that would allow me to install whatever I needed. However most apps cannot be put onto the SD card and also even apps that can be put either completely or partially install to the phone first and then have to be moved to the SD card which kind of defeats the purpose (there is a setting where you can theoretically have it install to the SD card first but in my experience it didn't work). 4GB sounds like a good amount of memory but most of it is taken up by junk apps that you can't delete. I currently have a gmail appgoogle maps  groupme whats app venmo and a pdf reader on my phone (some of which are partially on the sd card) and my phone is completely out of space. Also theres a few random bugs (might just be my phone though) for example if i turn brightness on when my phone goes to sleep the screen will not come back on unless i hard reset it (not a problem though if the brightness is kept off). Also the camera takes really awful pictures (I generally use my phone to take pictures of notes for class but it is impossible with this phone to do so). Overall though its cheap and works pretty well in doing the basics so if you need a backup I recommend it but if you want a full time phone I would not get this one purely because of the lack of space.
