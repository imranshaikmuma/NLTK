UPDATE 2 1/2 years later.The colors are still bright they don't bleed or fade..  A lot of the stitching came out in my first washing (see below) but they have not frayed much since. I use these daily despite the loose stitching.  They are not square or evenly cut and will not fold into a triangle.  I am upgrading my rating from 1 star to 3 stars because the colors and fabric are actually very good.  It's the construction that's bad.-------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this 12 pack of 12 colors after reading the reviews of MANY of these Chinese made bananas.  Many reviews here complain they are not color-fast so I washed all 12 bandanas together three times with cool warm then hot water to let them bleed alone together and set the colors.ALL 12 BANDANAS ARE FALLING APART AFTER THREE WASHES ALONE.The stitching is beginning to unravel in several places and the ends are fraying !!The colors are nice the fabric is good but *ALL* bandanas are fraying ........ pathetic.I suggest you look elsewhere.
