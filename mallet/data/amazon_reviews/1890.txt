Budget friendly laptop with solid performance. Good enough performance for most assuming you upgrade the RAM which I changed to 12 GB because the stock RAM 4GB is not enough. If you want to do photo or video editing or play the latest games RPG first person shooters you should look elsewhere. This comes with a DVD burner whereas other laptops in this price range and all netbooks do not. If that's important to you then this may be a good option. There is 1 USB 3.0 drive on the side and 2 USB 2.0 slots in the back. It would have been nice if all the USB slots were 3.0.As a major plus this didn't come with any bloatware that you will get with HP laptops and other manufacturers. It's my fist Acer but for under $300 I think it is a solid laptop that most people would be happy with.
