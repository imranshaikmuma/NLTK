A very nice and small point and shoot camera. We took this to Alaska two weeks ago and used it extensively to photograph animals in Denali Park. The zoom feature worked very well. The only limitation using the zoom is that the image on the viewfinder is so small that I did not know if I got the images I wanted until we got back to the lodge and I loaded the memory card into my laptop. Then we could see the full image magnified and could edit or delete those we did not want to keep. I have other larger cameras and chose not to take them as they are bulky. This little camera fits in a pocket. I gave my big digital SLR camera to my daughter as it was a pain to carry on a trip. Others with us in the park had elaborate equipment and several commented favorably on my images when seeing them on the laptop. It is a good choice forma trip unless you want superzoom capability and are willing to put up with the equipment. The battery life is also excellent. I have taken trips in the past with teenagers who were always having to recharge batteries. I did not recharge this one at all.
