the worst experience ever even now that I am writing this review I still have not succeeded for this camera to work properly. I followed all the suggestions the support team gives me but until now no results at all. I really do not know what to do because at the end neither the support team helps me. They have been giving me the same answers they gave me in previous emails and until now I don't know if its a hardware problem of the camera a software problem of the application or a problem with the cube (that seems that it works satisfactory). A serious company would have suggested to return immediately the product. After all these weeks that have past and if i was not in Greece I would do it immediately.As for the camera I cannot give my true opinion because until now it does not work properly.
