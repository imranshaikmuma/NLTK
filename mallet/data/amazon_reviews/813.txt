The device performance is snappy and paired with a very nice screen. The front facing speakers are clear though not particularly loud. A sore spot is the camera which is a tad slow to focus.The major problem though is that Nextbit the company has been bought out and the Robin discontinued.Furthermore the warranty has been reduced to 6 months. That means July folks!! Broken Robin? SOL!I like my device but recommend you think twice before hitting the Buy Button.
