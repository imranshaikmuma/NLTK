I was looking for a waterproof camera to take on the family vacation that I could reuse (ie. not a disposable). I figured I'd give this one a try since it was only $80 digital took still pictures and video and the dual display feature seemed neat. I got this with Prime shipping with enough time to test it out before vacation. Note: the batteries and microSD card do not come with the camera as it states. So if you do purchase this also get the microSD card. Amazon packaged it with the SanDisk. I got a 32G microSD card for $13. That was cheaper than other vendors I checked out.I tested it in the pool with my daughter and took video and pictures. I attached a picture here's the video link https://youtu.be/jnU55pOE6f4. It was pretty good quality for the price paid. I didn't want to pay $$$ for a GoCam or equivalent so for $80 I'm really happy with my purchase. Other reviewers thought less of the item but perhaps they just got a bad one. IMO I'm happy I got this for vacation. By the way my daughter dropped this several times already and it is pretty rugged.
