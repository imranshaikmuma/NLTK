Oh my gosh this camera. I'm coming from using a Nikon D700 and I can tell you this is a nice step up all around from that old workhorse. The low light performance is spectacular and the noise is very polite even at ISO 12800. I only needed to take the noise reduction/luminance smoothing up to 50 in Lightroom to clear it up at for the pictures shot at ISO 12800 vs having to take it up to 75 with the D700 after shooting at ISO 3200. I took it out to photograph an accident that happened last night (see pic) and I was using a 70-300mm f4.5/5.6 Nikon lens @ 300mm and I didn't have a tripod handy so I kept the shutter speed above 1/30 sec and set the ISO to 12800 and the pictures came out pretty clear and the noise was very manageable. This thing owns the night (see church pic). I tried to get that shot earlier this year and I could never get the focus right. This camera just nailed it right away and I could leave the middle of the road sooner (always a plus). I'm big into astro-photography and also not having to use flash in indoor social situations and this camera delivers. AWB is pretty spot on as well with astro shots being the only issue. Video quality recording is something the D700 was lacking and I am pleased that I now own a 1080p 60fps camcorder as well. The microphone doesn't like being too close to a baby grand piano but that is to be expected. All other videos have been just fine. All in all I'm very pleased with this camera's performance and I look forward to a long a prosperous relationship with it.
