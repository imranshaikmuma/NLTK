I used to wake up in the middle of the night barely able to walk the 15 feet to the bathroom because my feet were so sore. These insoles have made a measurable difference. I still have some soreness but it is greatly reduced and I have no problems with that 15 foot stroll at 3AM.It took about a week to adjust the the shape on my foot and it wasn't always pleasant but totally worth the week of a bit of discomfort as my feet adjusted for the comfort they have provided since.An antidote I will add... I was trying on a nice pair of Allen Edmonds at one of their stores and the salesman told me he has had several customers who use them and had heard good things about them as well.
