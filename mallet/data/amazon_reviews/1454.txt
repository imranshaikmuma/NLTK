This shirt is made from a very soft material that feels smooth against your skin. While the material is a heavy weight it is not binding because of a generous cut. The body of the shirt is extra long that stays tucked in through a full day of many different body movements. The chest pocket is larger than a standard t-shirt pocket. I have quite long arms these sleeves are a great length for me.
