I like these pants. They aren't my favorite but they are fairly comfortable and fit well. I bought an XS-petite I am 5' tall and 120 lbs athletic but hourglass figure. They fit me nicely and are flattering on me. I find the material is sort of thin however and the stitching doesn't seem as strong compared to my other scrubs (I prefer Dickies). I think if you live in a hot environment the thin fabric of these pants would be good because I find in the summer these allow a little more "breeze" to get through than other pants. On the downside I also find these pants are not very forgiving with panty lines..but if your scrub top covers your bum then you may not have to worry about that or if your rear end is not so big then maybe it isn't noticable at all. My rear end is definitely on the large side and so that's something that I don't like about these pants. I also don't like that the pockets are very "basic" compared to the similarly priced Dickies. Overall I prefer my dickies but these are still comfortable pants and if you live in a hot environment or get hot while working you might benefit from the thinner fabric. I gave these 4 stars because they are very modestly priced and I didn't expect anything more than what I got but I didn't give them a 5 because I feel that the Dickies are superior quality and you are in the same price point. There's nothing wrong with these pants I wear them regularly and might buy more if I move to a warmer state but I wish the pockets were a little more organized (pens always fall out of these pockets..). These are very modestly priced and I'd still say these are FAR better than the cheapo scrub pants you can get at Walmart. Cherokee is a good brand I just have a preference for the Dickies pants.
