I have been struggling with plantar fasciitis and bought these to replace the insoles in my workout shoes on the recommendation of a friend who had used them.  They are much harder than the standard insoles that come with sneakers and I don't feel as if the arch support reaches far enough in toward the center of my foot to provide good support. I finally went to the podiatrist a few weeks ago and purchased the insole they recommend the Powerstep PRO Protech full length and wish I had purchased them first instead of the Superfeet!  The arch on the Powerstep insole reaches in to the middle of my foot and provides far superior support to my arch than the Superfeet did and they have a cushier feel while still providing excellent support.  Also they were about $10 cheaper.  (A tip to pass on to anyone who may be suffering with plantar fasciitis...one of the things my podiatrist recommended that I had NOT been doing on my own was to apply heat (NOT ICE) to my foot and this has helped tremendously in conjunction with rolling my arch on a baseball and stretching daily!)
