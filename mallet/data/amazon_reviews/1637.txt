I really like these. All of the pockets are great and I like their look. I recently lost quite a bit of weight so I was hesitant to check the fits larger than expected box so I wanted to qualify that with it may just be my weight loss that makes them seem too big. Also I have no butt so scrubs always fit me kinda funky. I ordered a medium which was the size I wore the last time I was this weight (150#). That being said I like these enough that I am going to order them in a small and see if I like that fit better. And even though these are large on me I'll still wear them. You should try a pair!
