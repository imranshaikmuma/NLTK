I'm a bartender at a high volume waterfront restaurant. I'm on my feet for 8 to 10 hours a day on average. I previously used "Dr." Scholl's  gel work insoles until I bought these superfeet greens. There is no comparison for someone with high arches the support level of the greens is unmatched even after hours of standing. I highly recommend these to all my fellow service industry workers.Side note: I also bought the Superfeet orange love them too they are similar to the greens but have a much softer foam on the front of your foot. I prefer the greens for work (walking) and the orange for high impact (running). Hope that helps.
