I ordered this one because it was cheaper than getting it brand new. I purchased the option for express shipping ($14) and it said it was going to come on Monday because I ordered it on a Thursday(the 28th). It came the very next day! I was a little worried that it wasn't going to look brand new but I was wrong. Everything was wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap so nothing got damaged. It looked as if I paid for a brand new one. All of the items were there and I immediately put it together and turned it on. No problems at all that I can see at the moment. The only thing I don't like is the strap. It doesn't seem like it'll last long so I'll just buy a better thicker one. But overall  Im happy about this purchase! Now all I have to do is buy extra batteries more cards a better strap and a durable bag.
