I'm 5'9'' 150 lbs...I read every review and went ahead and ordered the 2 pack Grey Medium pants after reading how others experienced their fit. I usually wear a Small or Medium (depending on the fit) but am happy I chose the Mediums because they fit perfectly around my thighs waist and booty. They are a wee bit long but I expected that after reading the reviews and I have long legs so they don't drag on the ground for me too much. I imagine that if you are shorter you will run into that issueThey are also stretchy so if you put on a few lbs these are the perfect pants to hide away in and still look cute. Being able to fold the waist band over OR keep it up is awesome because if I'm  having a "puffy" or bloated day it makes me feel better mentally knowing I can cover my tummy up some more!They also make your butt look really good!My boyfriend loves them ;)I highly recommend these if you're looking for a comfy fitting yoga pant that you can relax in and still feel sexy!
