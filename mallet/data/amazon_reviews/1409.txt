I bought these in medium but they are considerably smaller than my other medium underwear from Fruit of the Loom. So I can√§t use them. The fabric is also very thin but I guess thats OK considering the low price ($12 for 5). Will not buy again though. I will stick with the regular "Fruit of the Loom Men's Boxer Briefs 100% Cotton Underwear" which are thicker and will last longer.http://www.amazon.com/Fruit-Loom-7-Pack-Briefs-Underwear/dp/B00U7ZLAAC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1462057211&sr=8-4&keywords=fruit+of+the+loom+underwear+men+7+pack
