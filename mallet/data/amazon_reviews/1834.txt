Pros: it seems rather stable. I've not yet had it really freeze up. The screen is large. The number pad is a nice addition.Cons: it's slow as can be! Given the specs I'm surprised it's as slow as it is. It starts up quickly but programs take awhile to open and there's often hesitation before it seems to register a click. Also the graphics processing is sub par. With a screen this large I'd like to see higher resolution. This may be good for some but I would prefer more utility out of that screen area.
