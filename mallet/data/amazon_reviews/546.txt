Used it on 10 snorkles over 4 days in Mexico.  8 snorkles in saltwater off the beaches 2 snorkles in freshwater cenotes including a deep cenote which included diving down about 25 feet.  Battery lasted a long time.  Underwater videos were pretty good quality.  The photos were ok but not that great.One thing to note - most cameras have the lense in the middle.  Because the lense on this camera  is in the corner you need to adjust how you are taking pictures.I always found small drops of water when I opened the seals to access the battery or to plug in the USB cord to download the pictures to a computer.  I dont know if water was getting into the camero or the water gets into a portion of the seal and when you open the seal it gets into the camera.  Once I opened the seal I left the seal open so that it was completely dry before I closed up the seal.
