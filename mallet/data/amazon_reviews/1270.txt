I'll give two starts for effort. It's a cute design and sexy idea....but not really made with us curvy girls in mind. I'm 5'7" wear 16 in jeans 38D chest and this just fit very awkwardly. If you're a little jiggly in the belly like me all this does is enhance the view of your love handles. And if you're taller the crotch less panty part isn't exactly in the right area. And being busty this just barely covers your nipples and forget trying to move and keep em in place at the same time. It's just pretty much awkward looking and uncomfortable. Like I said I give credit to the idea but if you don't look like the model in the photo it's not gonna look or fit all that great.
