Best laptop I ever purchase and that's not an overstatement. Very quite light and extremely portable. Have mostly the hardware input you need in 2016-2017 era (USB-C USB 3.0 etc.) Will heat up a little bit while charging (so don't use it on your lap - while charging) but nothing serious. Everything heats up a bit while charging. Also a very good battery life. A regular workload can last a whole day (min 8hrs)
