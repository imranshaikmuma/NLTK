No surprises -- Lee jeans still fit exactly like they always have at an affordable price. Something I can count on!  Jeans that look & feel good right away (none of that "breaking in" stuff) and they keep getting better over time as you wear them. Nothing flashy -- just well-made practical jeans that look good and last forever. Well not quite forever.Like threadbare PJ's or a favorite teddy bear those old Lee jeans finally retire making way for new comfortable ones. Studies have shown that this process -- outgrowing and casting off a beloved pair of jeans then buying a new pair just like the old -- can inspire sudden urges to go get a haircut or jump into a playful litter of bouncing puppies. There's nothing quite like a new pair of blue-jeans to remind us about relaxing and feeling good in our bodies.
