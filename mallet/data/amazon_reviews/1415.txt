These are excellent boxers. They fit very well and they don't ride up. They are extremely comfortable too. I used to have other kind of boxers but they weren't nearly as comfortable and they would ride up. I am happy I found my go-to brand and style so I don't need to experiment with other junky brands. It also helps that these are very cheap. Some other brands I've seen charge this much for just one pair. Luckily it is not the case with this. Because it is so comfortable I would say it definitely earned every single star and I would highly recommend it!
