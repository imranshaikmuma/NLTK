I purchased the SX620 as a pocket camera for special events traveling and so forth. The camera is quite easy to use and provides decent photos with very little effort. For the novice photographer it is a great camera. If you simply need a simple camera for weddings museums galleries parties insurance claims and those sorts of things this is a nice camera to have on hand. The camera is a decent size not too small but also not too large. You can easily carry this camera in a jacket pocket but it might be bulky for trousers. I did purchase an extra battery and extra memory card which both came in useful during a casual day of shooting photos. The camera is still new but I have had Canon cameras for years and count on their reliability and craftsmanship. You do have to get used to the flash not being automatic as the user has to raise the flash manually. The quality of the photographs is great! For the cost to include accessories it is quite a good camera!
