Wow! Best scrubs ever! I've only ever owned Wonder Wink Grey's Anatomy and MedCouture scrubs but I was tired of them shrinking and ripping and then having to buy more. They're too expensive! So I tried these $15 scrub sets. Oh my word. I'm 5'5" at 170 lbs and these scrubs fit true to size!!! They are the absolute best and they have cargo pockets! Will be ordering more! You can't go wrong with these. However if you're taller than 5'5" be advised that these scrubs may be too short for you. You've been warned.
