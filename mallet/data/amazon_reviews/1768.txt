Excellent quality that I've come to expect from Dickies.The only problem was that I took peoples advice from previous comment and bought the shirt one size smaller than normal. This shirt runs true to size. I'm 5'9" 185 lbs. I need a large and should have bought a large.Ended up giving the shirt to a friend and ordering a large.Great product. Fast shipping.Lesson learned.
