Not bad. These types of socks have a tendency to slip off and these are no exception although they aren't as bad on account of the little rubber grip pad at the ankle. The slipping off mostly happens when I'm wearing these with the wrong shoes- shoes in which I should wear normal socks. With low cut flats they stay on. I specifically bought these to wear with some classic Keds slip ons. They work really well with those coming up to just the right level to be virtually hidden but to still protect from edge rub. I wear an 8 in shoes and have no fit problems with these. They are very stretchy so they should work for most sizes.
