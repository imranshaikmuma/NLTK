I'm typing my review on this Chromebook right now. It's a really great computer. This is my third Chromebook and the best one yet. It's really awesome. I love the big screen size which is bigger than most which are 11.9. This is a full 13 inches. It's also extremely light and the battery lasts for about 15 hours with low screen and regular usage. It still lasts about 6-8 hours watching videos or doing high processing with a bright screen. And the battery charges super fast. I think it only takes about an hour to fully charge it from empty which is pretty amazing. One hour of charging for 15 hours of use. I don't even get that from a battery pack.I got the red color and that was my favorite. But I don't think you can go wrong with any of the four different colors. I also got the 4GB RAM option and I really notice a difference. With my older 2GB Chromebook then most social media sites would slow down and I had do disable Flash to get good performance. With this then it works great and fast even if I have 20 tabs open and Flash is churning on advertisements in the background.The only complaint that I have is that the space bar is pretty loud. I press it on the far right side. I'm not sure if I got a defective one or if it's a design problem with the keyboard. But it's holding up pretty well and still works. It just makes an audible click when I press on it.Overall I highly recommend this model. I already use a Chromebook every day so it wasn't a transition for me.
