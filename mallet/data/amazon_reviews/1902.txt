I love my new laptop!  The screen display is phenomenally sharp. This replaces an older Dell laptop I got a few years back so was anxious for the new & improved technology & hardware.  I use this for personal use only so unsure if I really needed to run high-end programs that this would be sufficiently fast enough.  I'm still getting used to the touch & feel of the keyboard as the 'spongy' feel will take a while to get adjusted to it. The audio is awesome.  All in all great purchase for the price.
