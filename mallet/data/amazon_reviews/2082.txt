I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I see that a lot of people are bashing this laptop for no reason so I'll set some things straight. The UHD screen is amazing as far as I can tell it is indeed a full 4k resolution (tested with 4k youtube videos vs my 1080p desktop monitor). Specs are pretty fantastic for the price - you'd have to spend $500-$1000 more to get the same specs with Dell or Mac. I've had absolutely no issues with fan noise nor are there any issues with the speakers buzzing at full volume. And honestly I can't believe people are actually complaining about the track-pad being off-center. Get real folks - it's not even noticeable. The touch screen is a nice feature although admittedly I don't really use it.My one complaint is the built-in speakers are disappointingly low even at max volume. I found that it was difficult to hear at times when watching full length movies from 5-6 feet away. This can easily be remedied by plugging into something like a 5.1 setup but it's still annoying.Overall a fantastic laptop for the price.
