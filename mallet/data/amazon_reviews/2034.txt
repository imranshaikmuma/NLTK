It is an excelent device  i am looking for mobility then i need a laptop without fans.  I owned a Dell xps 13.3 -exellent too-  but it has fans and its hots my lap therefore i need to use a book or another stuff to wor comfortably.  If you need full mobility try a core M procesor over the Core i.This device is all I am looking.I rate it with four stars because it has problems with the windows implementation the windows firts run setting program show the death blue screen.  I try so many methods to repair It and takes me four hour at least.  Another problem was the crash blue screen when I turn it to tablet.
