My old laptop had 2gb of ram and only 32 gb's of harddrive space -- i know the horror. Obviously this meant i couldn't do much on it; not that im truly complaining since i didn't have to buy it myself. As a writer and an avid player of The Sims 4 I'm sure you can see why my old computer just wasn't cutting it.This computer is perfect. I can download the sims 4 and play the game effortlessly. i can also do all of the writing i need to.The set-up upon receiving the computer took about 30 minutes give or take and hasn't once put up a fight.So far my only issue is how sensitive the touch pad is but I mostly use a mouse so that's not even really an issue.All in all I am very pleased with my new computer so far.
