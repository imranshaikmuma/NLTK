I bought this phone because I needed it to hold my other foreign SIM cards. Opened the boxed packaging from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this phone! I was honestly expecting cheaper plastic and something more tacky-looking. But this phone actually looks decent - the white casing with blue accent looks cute - and this is coming from a usually hard-to-please designer!Look & feel: The textured casing makes the phone allows for a firm grip and the size is perfect for one-handed operations. The white & blue casing with a hint of silver as the directional keypad and matte grey as the fonts looks pleasant.Keypad/buttons: Keypad/buttons are well designed with just the right size and good tactile feedback. The keypads are grooved too so this makes it quite nice to press. The keys are very responsive as well - no "laggy" feeling between button presses as with some smartphones!Display: For something that's under $20 it works well enough. The important part is I could read everything clearly!Sound: Good enough to play the FM radio - there was a talk show on and I could hear every word loud & clear without the volume turned up even. I can't speak for the music quality though I'm used to very high-end audio so my ears are forever spoiled.Camera: This phone is under $20. Let's not expect too much here. ;)Dual-sim: This works as advertised. Takes full size SIM. I have a micro SIM which I fit within the full size cutout of my full size SIM cardboard (you'll get the whole cardboard when you purchase a SIM pack from your mobile service provider).Bonuses:- The FM radio is a really nice touch. You could listen to the radio with this.- Phone also comes with a F1 racing game.- Torchlight is functional :)Overall: Definitely worth the price I paid for. I'm impressed that they managed to make a phone that looks decent feels solid and allows dual-sim for a reasonable price. If you want a back up (dumb)phone this is .
