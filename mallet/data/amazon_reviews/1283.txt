The only good thing about these is that they are actually long enough and fit right. They are see through and attract any and I mean any hair or fuzz. If you have dogs don't waste your money. If you don't keep your house spotless and dust free every second of the day don't waste your money. If you prefer to not have your skin showing through your pants don't waste your money
