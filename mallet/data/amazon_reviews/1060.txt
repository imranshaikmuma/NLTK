This shirt is simply amazing. The fabric is soft and doesn't cling to your body. It's a lightweight yet durable material that is figure-flattering. I'm 5'6" and 138 lbs. the medium fits me very well. The arm holes closely encircle your arm and don't show off your armpit. I love that aspect of the shirt. The banded bottom is fitted yet not tight. I bought the shirt in the dark gray and immediately purchased the black once I tried it on. I could buy one in every color!*The picture is of the shirt straight out of the package so it is wrinkly. I have a shoulder tattoo on my left side and I like that this shirt shows it a bit.
