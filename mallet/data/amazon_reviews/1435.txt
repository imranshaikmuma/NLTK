I'm officially stuck on Lee jeans!!! I bike a lot during the summer so I have somewhat athletic legs and I have a thin waist for my leg length. I bought one of these pairs at a local store and they fit perfectly so I decided to order some more. These fit exactly like the ones I had. They're very durable meaning I don't wear holes through the knees (unlike most other jeans I've had) without being made from a thick stiff material and mine developed a very subtle faded look as I used them which I personally like. I would definitely buy these again!
