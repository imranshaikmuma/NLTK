Phone was purchased June 1 2016.  It was been about a month that I have been having issues with charging the phone.  It would take a long time to charge and I had to hold the cables a certain way for the phone to charge. I bought an expensive cable from Best buy to make sure that it was the phone and not the cable that was causing the charging issues.  The  charging port kept disconnecting and not holding a charge. Any movement slight movement of the phone would stop the charging and the phone would think the charger had been removed. I've tried multiple chargers and a factory reset of the phone none of which has helped. .  I have contact BLU through their website. I will update once I get this resolve.Update:  10/11/2016Blu will be sending me a replacement phone at no additional cost to me.This is my second BLU phone and it is the first time I have had an issue.
