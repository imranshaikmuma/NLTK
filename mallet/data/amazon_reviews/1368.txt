These are my favorite scrub pants.  I prefer these to the drawstring waist.  They wear really well but the elastic only lasts about a year.  But for scrubs that seems pretty good with weekly wear for 10 hours a day working with animals! The petite length works best for me because the normal length seems to be really long. But once I figured out what size I wear I haven't had any problems since.
