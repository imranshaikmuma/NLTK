I am obsessed with Dansko shoes!I own too many pairs and my husband bought a new pair for me to wear for my new teaching position in the fall.This pair will probably be my informal pair.  They look better in person!Dansko clogs are terrific for everyday use.I like the "dressy" ones as I wear them daily.Many teachers wear tennis shoes and I did that myself for a few months however as a special educator dealing not only with students teachers and school professionals (admin. psych. OT etc)  I hold frequent meetings with parents I am presentable and comfortable.  The best of both worlds if you ask me.I did purchase the competitor shoes (S...ita) and I must say they do not hold their shape the same they wore a lot faster and the leather has scuffs and scratches they look awful even after I painted them sorry but they are not worth the money.I have had my danskos for years... and I have a hard time parting with them.I feel  confident wearing my Dansko clogs.They should be worn with socks especially the first few times.  I also wear them with thicker socks to break them in for the first few weeks.Nonetheless these are my favorite shoes to wear hands down.
