I was aware of comments regarding slowness of operation and "fuzzy" pictures when we bought this camera. I deliberately avoided the 20 MP (or greater) cameras since the processing speed of budget point-and-shoot cameras would be slow to write photo files of this size to memory. Most photo quality printers can only reproduce 8.2 MP in print and the human eye is unable to detect the difference between 8MP and 20 MP. The MP ratings refer to the density and therefore the SIZE of the data file... without a lightning fast processor it's going to take a bit to write a 12 MP photo file to the camera's memory stick... hence the "slow" speed and "fuzzy" photos... with the "fuzzy" part being the result of not holding the camera rock-steady while the processor writes the file to memory.You can compensate for the processor speed by selecting a lower MP setting for your pictures... this will allow you to take and write photo files to memory faster without discernable loss of resolution and quality.... you can find the "breakpoint" by taking the same still photo at different MP settings and determining at what setting you notice a degradation in picture quality and write-speedTry it.... it really worked well for me
