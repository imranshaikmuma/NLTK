Very DISSATISFIED with the camera!It takes "okay" pictures (about what I expected for the price) but it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE (I can't emphasize that enough) to get it to connect via wifi with Ricoh's app on my iPhone 5 (with latest iOS 9.3.2). The 3 or 4 times I've been successful it was only after deleting all my iPhone's wifi connection info (house work camera) making sure no background tasks were running on the iPhone cycling power on the camera and iPhone several times.  The iPhone and camera have no problem connecting the problem lies in Ricoh's app failing to recognize a connection has been made. Without Ricoh's app there's no way to remotely preview/trigger a picture.  Sadly the process is not repeatable (meaning if I go through the process described above there's no guarantee the app will work). The Ricoh website/manual instructions are of no help (tried all that before deleting all my personal wifi connection info) and neither is Ricoh customer support (they basically reiterated what their manual stated).There are a couple other apps in the app store I'll give those a try.  Otherwise the camera is solidly built connects well with the laptop via USB cable for picture upload/download. As most have already stated the design of the lenses on opposite sides of the camera make it somewhat awkward to lay it down.
