Amazon somehow shipped this to me 4 days early.I'm an Android developer and have access to a ton of phones.  I'm coming from a nexus 5x which well had a few terrible bugs (muting conference calls wtf) and terrible battery life.  This z play is a revelation.  It's blazingly fast compared to the 5x.  It feels faster even though 8 x a53 cores shouldn't be faster.  I have a s7 for work and it feels no slower.  The build is great and feels at least as nice as day a Samsung s6/s7.  Our Google pixel phones came today as well and honestly this feels as fast and build wise more expensive.  The battery life is amazing too.  Maybe losing 5% after surfing the web for an hour is pretty special.The price is a bit more than Motorola's last gen.  I had a 2015 moto x ..... And this is just a better phone than that.  Faster and nicer materials and amoled.  What a difference a year makes.
