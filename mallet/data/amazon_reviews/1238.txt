I have one pair of these and several other brands (powersox dri-fit etc).  These are my "go to" socks.  I just bought two more pair so that I don't have to worry about washing the one pair to have it ready for the next run or ride.  Very soft keep feet dry and comfortable (even on the long runs).  The Dri-fits are ok but I feel like they are "slippery" inside the shoe.  These are more substantial and feel better.
