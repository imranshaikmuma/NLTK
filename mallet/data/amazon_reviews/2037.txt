The more I use this (like right now) the more I like.  A very short learning curve moving from my iPad.  Great touch screen fast light and durable.  Perfect travel device.  Only thing wish A) it came in a different color and B) back-lit keyboard (as others have said).  So far Windows 10 is very stable and SSD gets this puppy up and working in seconds.
