This laptop has potential it's a beautiful design with a sleek finish. However I have had it not more than 2 weeks and it's already been having problems that are definitely a concern. The screen has flickered black in and out the audio on the laptop crashed and I had to install an audio driver to get it back up and the fan noise can get pretty loud (which isn't the biggest deal but still). I was looking for something more stable than what I've experienced so far with this laptop.
