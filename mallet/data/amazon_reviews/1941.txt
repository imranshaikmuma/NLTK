The seller for the computer I rec'd was Maxx Store I believe. It was Prime and arrived on the scheduled date. I was concerned from reading other reviews that this might be a used or refurbished computer so I used Amazon Chat and was assured that it would be new.  Amazon sent a transcript of chat exchange to my email and it appears to be accurate and complete.  The computer I rec'd was in a sealed Apple container and is new.Setup went very well; I fumbled a little because this is my first new Mac and my first setup but I was able to complete without assistance. The only glitch that I haven't overcome so far is that I'm not able to live stream television from Comcast using the Chrome browser. It works perfectly with Safari but with Chrome all I get is audio. I'm using the latest Adobe flash player - I think.All that said the computer I received appears to be exactly as advertised and performs as good or better than what I expected. I'll modify this review if I find a problem - keeping my fingers crossed!
