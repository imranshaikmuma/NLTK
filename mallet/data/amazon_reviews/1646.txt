There does not seem to be consistency in sizing.  This is the second pair which I ordered using the size of the original pair (W9) that was in use for about 2 years.  But this second pair was physically larger than the original pair even if I ordered the same size (W9).  I had to return this new pair to Amazon and have them ship a pair one size smaller (W8).Makes it difficult now to order again with any degree of certainly that you will get the right physical size.
