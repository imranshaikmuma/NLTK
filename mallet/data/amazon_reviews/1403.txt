I've worn two pairs of these shoes one to Europe and one to Australia.Pros: These pack easily in my luggage.  The white or off-white color will get dirty but they're scrubbable and dirt comes out.  I averaged 20-30K steps a day on both trips and these shoes stay on due to the elastic heel/back of the shoe without rubbing there.Cons: The stitching on the outer edge of the town box does tend to hurt my little toes but not enough to cause blistering or bleeding.  Since I don't wear socks with them and I wear them around cities multiple days in a row in hot climates they smell worse than typical athletic sneakers that you wear with socks - I bought Odor Eaters powder foot spray and that seems to work.
