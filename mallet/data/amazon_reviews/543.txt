Have had nothing but good experiences with the D30 an upgrade from the D10 I bought in 2009. Better zoom much thinner profile grat photos. I like the new GPS tagging it comes in handy (turing GPS and tagging on an off is a bit clumsy but not awful). If it is anything like the D10 (still running) this camera is indestructible. Most of the poor reviews of the D-series are about waterproof failure; this is likely due to operator error- failure to make sure the doors are clicked shut and the gaskets are totally clean- all gaskets will leak if they have sand in them.
