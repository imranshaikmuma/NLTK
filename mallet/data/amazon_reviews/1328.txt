I received my shirt and wore it to work today. I had many compliments on it as well!I'm 5'8" approx. 210 lbs C-cup and I went with what other reviews has suggested and ordered big. I normally wear an XL in womens too. Due to the reviews I ordered a 3XL. While it's pretty and flowy (if that's even a word :) ) I wish I would have gotten a 2XL. I never wear my clothes tight but I feel like I'm kinda swimming in the 3XL. Maybe it will shrink a little in the dryer? I'll definitely be ordering more!I hope this review helps with future orders! :)
