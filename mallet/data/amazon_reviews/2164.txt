First of all I love the look of this laptop. It's slim and fit my taste.It plays any game without any trouble. However the GPU temperature reaches 95 degrees celcius when playing DOOM. This is with a cooling pad. The temperature is scary high and I have no idea what to do to fix it.Playing games such as league of legends gives no challenge to this laptop so the temperature will stay kind of low. It will only go over 90 degrees if you play graphic dependent games such as DOOM or Ark: Survival Evolved.I'd recommend getting another laptop if you can find one at the same price with better cooling.Kevin
