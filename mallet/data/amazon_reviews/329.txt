I got this PowerShot because it took better photos than my old PowerShot.  Unfortunately this camera will not display movies on the screen.  You get a "Incompatible JPEG" message.  Neither Canon Community nor JustAnswer could give me a solution.  JustAnswer said my files were corrupt or unsupported.  NOT!  Here is my solution but I don't know why it works:  when the "incompatible" message is on the screen press the FUNCSET button then select "Play Linked Digest Movie."  The movies will run on the screen.  This also works when "SET" appears in the upper left corner of the screen with or without the JPEG message.  After writing this review I still had problems viewing photos on the camera so I sent the camera battery and memory card to Canon Service (before doing so I copied all photos to my laptop).  Canon Service's report said the camera was working normally - no charge.  I got everything back but the photos had been erased presumably through reformatting.  I prefer to leave my photos on my camera so I can share them with friends.  After a while I copy them to my laptop and delete them from the camera.  I've taken a few new photos with the camera and I haven't had problems viewing them.  I'll be taking more tomorrow at the zoo.  This is just to let other buyers know what to do in case they encounter the same issue.
