I got this camera for a trip that I'm going to be taking in august so I didn't plan on using it a whole lot before hand. I've turned it on a couple times and taken a total of four pictures. Overall I'd say I've had it on for 5 minutes collectively if not less. With just that little bit of time the battery has already died and it came fully charged. It doesn't come with a charger so I've got one on it's way along with an extra battery. I'm scared that it may not be the battery but the camera. Some of the buttons also don't want to work sometimes. It's a bit moody. Other than that everything else is positive. The picture quality is better than I originally thought it would be. The camera is small and lightweight perfect for someone like me who wants to take it hiking. I think for the price and it being refurbished it was a pretty good deal. Be sure to include the price of what the accessories are going to be. (I.e. Charger wrist strap SD card/ computer A/V cord) it doesn't come with any of that so you may end up paying a bit more. I just hope that I can figure out the battery problem and it's not something unfixable.
