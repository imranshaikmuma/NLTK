These are the absolute best scrub pants I have ever worn. They do run a little bigger than most brands but I stil ordered the same size. I'm very hippy so I am glad I did. These pants move with you. When I bend over or squat there is no plumbers crack whatsoever. I am 5'10" and I ordered these in a tall. They are the perfect length for me and do not touch the floor.The fabric is not cotton. This should be taken into consideration depending on your work environment. They may be a little warm if you work somewhere that is generally warmer.I have 2 cats and a dog at home pet hair on my scrubs is almost inevitable. These pants seem to repel hair. They are also winkle free out of the dryer. I will never go back to plain cotton scrubs.These pants also have ample pocket space. There are two hip pockets a thigh pocket and a back pocket.
