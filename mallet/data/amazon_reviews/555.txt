We are gone alot and wanted something to show us who is coming and going taking care of our home.  This camera works great but doesn't alarm very far from the camera.  We placed this camera near the inside man door and it doesn't pick up movement from the garage door opening or the side walk thru.  It only alerts if someone walks over by the inside door.  The picture quality is great. The speaker is really quiet so you really can't talk to a person via the camera.  We are still debating whether to buy more for our other inside door.
