Good design except for a key face (the number 6 for me) falling off when in the tablet mode.  In this mode the keyboard sits with the keyboard down and can catch on your clothing a blanket or whatever.  I took the unit to Best Buy but they said that they could not simply get me a new snap-on key.  Rather the entire unit needed to be returned to Lenovo to replace the full keyboard section: Stupid in my opinion!  I think I solved the problem by buying a plastic sleeve (essentially just a plastic envelope) that I now place over the keyboard before flipping the unit to tablet position.  Of course I had to cut a hole in the plastic sleeve where the fan vent is  It now works great and if a key were to fall off it is in the plastic envelope.  It would have been nice if the brilliant computer engineers that design for Lenovo would just think through what could go wrong in various positions then design the unit to address the potential shortfalls.  Maybe a mechanical engineer instead of only computer smart people.  Also I have used Windows 7 for many years and loved it;  it is taking some time to adjust to Windows 10.
