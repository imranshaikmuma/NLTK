A suggestion for anyone looking to find the right fit: I have a 33 inch waist. Normally I would choose a 32-34 'medium' pair of pants. When in comes to underwear I have found that I need to go up to 'large' to get a comfortable fit. I think this is due to the fact that cotton underwear will shrink after the first wash and dry. I recommend that if you intend to buy Fruit of the Loom underwear that you buy a test pack one size larger than your actual waist size.
