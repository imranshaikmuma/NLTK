This is my fourth Sony product after my purchase of Sony a7s RX100 and RX100III (wife's cam).  I currently also have the Lumix GH4 as I like to take videos as much as photos.  I bought the HX80 as a gift for my niece.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't quite need the prosumer 1" sensor point and shoot or who wants the extra zoom capabilities that the larger sensors can't pack in such a small form.  I will work backwards and start with the cons then the pros.Cons:*  Smaller 1/2.3 sensor as opposed to 1" sensor (then again price is reflective of smaller sensor and the 1/2.3 sensor on the HX80 is back illuminated which makes it much nicer than other comparable sensors)*  No 4k video*  No manual zoom*  No touchscreenPros:*  Pop up viewfinder*  Flash that's semi-tiltable*  Quick menu with 12 customizable functions*  Full PASM modes for manual and semi-manual controls plus full auto modes if that's the preference*  Monitor that tilts 180 degrees for selfies*  30X zoom fantastic for travelers*  High quality XAVC S video format up to 50mbps at 24p 30p and 60p (requires SDXC memory cards)*  PASM modes all available for video*  Video manual mode has auto-iso option (not all cameras allow video auto-iso in manual; i.e. the much more expensive RX100 doesn't have this option)*  5-AXIS image stabilizer works great*  WIFI/NFC included plus downloadable appsThere are many more features that I could go on about this neat little point and shoot just check out the spec sheets.  At this price level especially for those that like to shoot both photos and videos the Sony HX80 in my opinion is one of the best 1/2.3 sensor pocket cameras.  I hope you find this review helpful!
