We bought this for my son who needed a camera fora basic photography class at college.  he needed a camera that was had a manually adjustable ISO White balance aperture etc - and this camera fit the bill without breaking our budget.  If he were to continue with photography we would have picked up a full SLR but this class was just a basic requirement within his major so we didn't need the fuller featured camera.
