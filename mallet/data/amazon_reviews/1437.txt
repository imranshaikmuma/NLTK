Other then the ft these are the worst business pants I have ever owned. DO NOT buy these don't let the Haggar name fool you. The very first day I wore them (this is not an exaggeration) both of the cuffs frayed. In edition to the cuff this is the worst material weeve you could possibly have for black it's a rough texture and they are a lint magnets. No joke if there is a piece of lint floating 30ft from your position these pants call the lint over for a pants party. The weeve is also heavy and kind of cheap feeling (like burlap).The Positive.... They fit well and you don't have to iron them.Final thought I have owned Haggar before and I've never had any issues with them the quality of these make me feel like they are a cheep knock off. DO NOT buy these!
