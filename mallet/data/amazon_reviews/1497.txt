Bought two pairs same style and size different colors. They are completely different sizes although the tags both say 4t. The waistband and hips are about 2" different around and the length is about 6-7" off. What the hell? I was also expecting a higher quality at $10/pair since I can get Circo or Old Navy leggings for about $5 a pop and these don't seem any nicer at all. Thin material nothing exceptional in craftsmanship to justify the doubled price. Not happy with the order and would not recommend these leggings or this brand.
