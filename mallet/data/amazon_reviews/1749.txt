Love these! I remember getting my first pair of utility pants from Old Navy and I wore them until they wore out. Of course as fashions change utility pants were no longer a common pant anywhere. As a bigger girl I prefer wearing pants in the summer and these are perfect since they're so light. And as a youth minister I'm always carrying a million things so the big pocket on my leg and the Velcro-closure pockets on the back are ideal.I will be buying again.
