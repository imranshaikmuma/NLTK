Thanks to other reviewers I am perfectly happy with the scrubs I bought for my daughter.  I was prepared to order a much smaller size than she normally wears (I ordered an XS when she normally wears a M).I was also prepared for them to not be super soft but to wash very well.  That is exactly true.  They are not super SOFT but they are SMOOTH and comfortable for her.They wash perfectly come out wrinkle free from the dryer and hold their color nicely.I will continue to write reviews because I am so thankful for the reviews of others.  Because of the time and effort of other customers I can buy items and know exactly what I am going to be getting.  Thank you to all of you out there!
