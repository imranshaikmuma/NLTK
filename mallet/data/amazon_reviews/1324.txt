If you are a fan of lularoe you need this shirt. This shirt basically combines all the best elements of the perfect T Irma and Carly! At a fraction of the price! And frankly I think the quality is comparable! If you wash on cold gentle and hang to dry I imagine that it will last as long as any llr shirt. The t-shirt is thin and light weight and very flowy and it covers all the parts you need covered. It's very flattering! I'm getting one in every color and selling all my llr!
