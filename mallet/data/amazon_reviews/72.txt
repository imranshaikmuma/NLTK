I bought the 80D as an upgrade from my 70D. There aren't that many upgrades but I wanted to give my adult daughter my 70D so I figured this would replace it plus give me more megapixels and the additional focus points which will come in handy for my [flying] bird photos.I absolutely love the articulated touch screen and wish my 5D Mark lll and my 5DS offered it as well. I do a fair amount of macro photography and often do multiple exposures for focus-stacking. The 80D like the 70D has rear screen magnification up to 10x plus a moveable focus square which is a real blessing when using the magnification features and manual focus. The moveable focus square will also go to the edges of the rear-screen image which is very useable when filling the frame with the subject image. I have no negatives to report on this camera or for that matter the 70D...
