Definitely smarter than I am but it is kind enough to let me take really great photos.  One day I may figure it all out.  The instruction book is terribly unhelpful in many instances but it does give most of the basics.  I may figure out some of the bells and whistles before too long.  Small enough that I don't mind carrying it on hikes.
