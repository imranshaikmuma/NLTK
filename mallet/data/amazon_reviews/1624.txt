The review title is cliche but it really is appropriate here. I am a huge fan of Carhartt and their wonderfully durable clothing especially their pants. Carhartt KNOWS their pants. I have them in every grade of thickness from the heavy-duty 12 oz. dungarees to the duck double-front ones to the lightweight canvas carpenter pants. Aside from formal wear a few pairs of chinos and hiking pants I don't wear anything else.These middleweight pants are the perfect compromise between work-ready durability and clothes you can wear around town being of a narrower cut and lighter-weight fabric than Carhartt's iconic heavy duty pants which while famously durable are just intolerable in hot weather. The tool pockets and hammer loop are still there but they're unobtrusive enough not to clash with an Oxford shirt and a sport coat. The one pair I've bought will by no means be my last.
