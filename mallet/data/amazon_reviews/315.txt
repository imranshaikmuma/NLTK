I really wanted to like this but it really fails to live up to expectations. If you point it across the room it performs like a low resolution camera which is fine and not unexpected.  However when used in obscured (dark) places relying upon the built-in illumination it performs poorly.  It seems like the light from the LED's spill into the field of view and overwhelm the camera.  I've used it to look into nooks and crannies of my engine and suspension and cannot make out what it's pointed at.  If I'm able to shine a flashlight into the area there is some resolution - but trying to manuver the cable and head orient a flashlight and position my phone for viewing is a total pain in the neck.IMO it's little more than a toy.  At this price I suppose it performs OK for some tasks.
