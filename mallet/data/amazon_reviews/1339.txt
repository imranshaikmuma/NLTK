Absolutely the best deal you can get on leggings. They aren't see-through and they fit perfectly. Just make sure you follow the size guide and you'll get exactly what you need. They ride up just over my belly-button for a size Large at 5'6" height and 160 lbs. The crotch is perfectly gusseted too so you don't get the dreaded camel toe. They also wick away sweat just like my Nike leggings and aren't damp or make you feel gross even after an hour-long cycling or running session. Perfect. Seriously. I've been recommending them to all the other ladies that go to the gym with me.
