Have purchased and worn Carhartt Work Wear pocket "T" Shirts for a dozen years plus with great satisfaction however something has gone wrong with them. The fit is no longer correct the tight neck and smoothness is gone the fabric quality and thickness is also gone which used to be the best of any t shirt made. I now understand they are made in several different world wide locations but my last ones I bought were from 3 different countries and the difference in them was astounding nothing was the same they all lacked the "old  Carhartt fit." I left a negative review on Carhartt's website which was rejected however I did receive an email from Terrie in customer service asking me to call them and explain my situation. I spoke to them today 3/28/16 and explained to an Inga in customer service what I was experiencing and she tried to explain that the factories were required to make them exactly the same material fit and quality. I explained mine were not close to same and all were terrible. She apologized and was very nice and offered me a discount and free shipping if I would give them another chance and she explained that  Carhartt has run across situations where other on line stores were able to purchase "seconds" in vast quantities and sell them at a serious discount of course my first reply was couldn't Carhartt put a stop to that as it obviously was creating a very bad brand name issue for a once terrific product. She said they would love to do that but it's work in progress. I took her up on her offer and ordered 6ea 2Xl white pocket "T's" through her and we'll see what happens
