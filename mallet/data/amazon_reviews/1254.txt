I ordered these for my mom.  She is a nurse and has a hard time finding scrubs that actually fit well because she is tall and thin.  She is 5'9" and usually wears a medium. She had  pair of these before and found them to run a little large for her so she ordered a small.  She is very pleased with them and I ended up ordering another pair for her. She like the flare leg style and said the pants are very comfortable wash well and retain their color.  The come in a wide variety of colors.  She will definitely be ordering more!
