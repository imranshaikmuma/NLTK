These shirts are super cute! My measurements are 37" 31" 37" and I ordered the Red and Olive in a Medium. The olive color is a little darker than what you would think of when people say olive but I think it's still a very nice color. As you can see from the picture the red tends to lean on the orange side (it's a little more red in person but the lighting was weird for those pictures) but it's a great bright color! The fabric is light and flowy exactly as I expected. Great for summer!  They fit very well and I love the way they look! The neckline is a little wide for me but if you plan on wearing it off the shoulder go for it! I probably could've gotten away with a small in this and still look just as good. I guess I'll have to order another one and see :)
