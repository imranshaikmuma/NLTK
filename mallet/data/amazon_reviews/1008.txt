1. I have a question I just received this phone today and I am using my own SIM card that I got from my other blue phone.2. The carrier I use is T-mobile BUT when I put the sim card into the Vivo phone it didn't detect the sim card so I can't call. I don't know what's the problem here.3. I've tried both ways in which I insert the sim card into the SIM and the SIM2 slot and it still didn't work.4. I don't know how to unlock phones this is my first time using it so can you walk me through on how I can get the sim card to work? Thanks!i attached a picture below so you know what I'm talking about
