I used the Samsung for 5 months and the screen went black--called Samsung and they indicated they would repair under warrenty.Once they received the phone they indicated the color of the phone did not match the serial no.--and that it was not authorized.Why am I sold a telephone by Amazon that is not authentic or authorized???I will attempt to return the phone to Amazon.But Buyer beware on these phones--$500 for a phone that cannot be repaired by the supposed manufacturer is a bit much!Update two days later . . .hip hip hooray for Amazon they made it right!
