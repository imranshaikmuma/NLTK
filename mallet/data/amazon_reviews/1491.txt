Too large and too long. Quite a difference from my previous purchases from Cherokee. I am 5'9 and 170 lbs and there is no way this should have been big on me. Everyone knows that you usually go with a smaller size when ordering scrubs especially bottoms. The bigger problem I had with these scrubs are that they are way too long. With the hem bottoms dragging on the ground and the bottoms falling down I look quite thug while wearing these lol. I have always ordered tall but never have they been this long. The quality is still there it just doesn't fit me right and I ordered the same size and length that I have ordered in the past. Not sure what's going on.
