Totally when from an iPhone user to android and staying android afterward.  $250 for a quality phone like this one there really should be no complaint.  32gb to start. Great battery life that last over a day with heavy usage.  Duo Camera rear and great front camera taking.  The screen resolution are great.  The size of the phone is great. fitted well in hand and comfy.  Very light compared to a smaller previous phone I got.  Super fast at charging too ( if you put it in ultra life mode to charge.  1% -about 2 hours for fully charge).  Phone itself got really great features and customize option that your guys can explore yourself.  Fingerprint scanner unlocked ARE crazy fast- no joke about that in 0.3 sec.  I don't understand why would I ever spend more money on phone when there one like this out there.  You NOT getting anything better anyway.  beside most phone life span 1-3 years.  Even you didn't physically damage it. the manufacturer will make it not lasted out.  New software draining you battery like madness.  incompatibility of apps ect.  that's just how business do thing.  But when you paying for a great phone like Honor 6x for 1/3 of the price.  You can get one every year just to get one lol.
