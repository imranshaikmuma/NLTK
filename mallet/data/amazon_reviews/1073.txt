I enjoy wearing tunics with my leggings. The material used for the LL women's boatneck is very soft stretchy and comfortable. It's so nice to lounge around the house in or even wear out and about.I am not a huge fan of this particular style/cut of shirt as I found myself adjusting it all day. The big sleeves are a little awkward and I personally prefer something more form fitting up top and around my arms. This is personal preference though. I just am not a fan of feeling my arm pits rubbing. It does cover my bottom so I am able to wear it with my leggings. I ordered a 3X and it fits great. For reference I am currently 5'5 215 lbs and a 42dd.
