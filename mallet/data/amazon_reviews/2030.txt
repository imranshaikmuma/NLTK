I purchased this as a gift for my wife. I wanted something light and fanless as she often has it on a pillow or blanket which blocks the cooling slots.This is a really nice PC both in laptop or tablet mode. I would love to replace my own work laptop with the Zenbook. i might need a little more processing power than the M-series in this one but only because of running SolidWorks on occasion. For day-to-day use this computer is outstanding. I did purchase a bluetooth mouse as she like that when using as a laptop. She is very happy with it which makes me VERY happy!
