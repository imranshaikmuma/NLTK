I received this phone almost two months ago and I absolutely loved it. It runs smoothly and quick enough for me. I have an extra SD card on it because I have some large file games on it and tons of pictures. I love the emoji art and tons of emoticons available. I began having trouble with it charging yesterday. I have contacted customer service through email and plan on calling tomorrow. I will give an update as soon as I know more. My previous phone was a BLU and I loved it too. It lasted me two years and I paid $120 for it. I was very pleased with it. I was very pleased with the Vivo XL also. Beautiful graphics quick charging and smooth running. Hopefully I just got a bad one and the matter will be resolved soon. Due to the bad reviews about customer service I will update my experience soon. It took about two weeks to send my phone off and they sent me a new one!  Love this phone!
