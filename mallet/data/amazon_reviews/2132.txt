9 days old and it needs a recovery boot repair.  That is a Windows problem but solutions on the web are not working.  There is very little support for this computer.  I finally found a way to contact Lenovo but they are only available weekdays.  I am back to my old computer with damaged screen to write this review.  Getting my new computer set up has been a nightmare.
