These pants are very nice I like the fit. I am 5'11" 175 Lbs and the 34W/32L size fits even though I normally wear a 32-33 waist. The length seems consistent with most other pants but the waist does seem to run a bit small. The overall fit is nice and loose not baggy just the way I like my pants to fit. Not as thick or "heavy" as typical jeans but not overly thin either. Kind of in the middle. I prefer thin and these are somewhat thin but I have thinner pants and would actually be fine if these were a bit thinner but that's just me. They can be worn with just about anything even a sport coat for a very semi-formal or business casual gathering. They also look great with a t-shirt tank or a nicely pressed Tommy Bahama shirt. The pant legs and crotch area are comfortably loose (not baggy) and they are wide enough at the bottom that they don't bunch up around your ankles. I hate that! People like that? These will "drape" over your shoes unlike the overly popular annoying and ridiculous looking "skinny" pants that are so common nowadays. They ARE a bit "cargo-ish" but kind of tastefully so and NOT overloaded with goofy looking pockets like typical (juvenile) cargo pants. They seem a bit more suited for the "untucked shirt look" but I haven't tried them with a tucked shirt and a sport coat but I suspect it would look just fine with the right choice of shirt (and shoes)! I like the fit and the look and my wife approved and she usually disapproves of my attire selections. Also the twill material is nice and "cottony" and is NOT a fuzz and pet hair magnet and I like that this material DOES NOT attract static cling like some pants do. I will probably buy a couple of other colors and these will be my "go to" casual pants for a couple of years until something else comes along and tickles my fancy.
