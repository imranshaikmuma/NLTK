Back in 2009 I bought a pair of Barco classic cordx scrub pants that were so light and fitted so well that I bought 5 more and then they were discontinued and I cried.  By luck I found these and they are exactly the same without the cord design and I am thrilled.  They are light and comfortable perfect fit at the waist thank god  so you don't have to pull them up all night long they have flair legs which always make your legs look better and they are he perfect length which has always been an issue with scrub pants for me..either an inch to short or the talls are way too long.  I'm 5'8 and 149 lbs and the medium are perfect.  Now if I can find these with cargo pockets on the legs I'll be even happier.  I can't wear scrub pants that are low rise or just draw string  these are elastic back and part draw string.  Just perfect.  Now I can throw all my other pants out that I have to pull up all flipping night long...thank GOD.  These scrub pants are awesome!!!!! Yay Barco
