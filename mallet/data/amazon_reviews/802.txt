Hi Srs. Amazon.On January this year I purchased 2 BLU Dash JR W D141w Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM... Phones from you.I got them about two months later due to delivery problems in my country Venezuela.After getting the  lines for them I started using them but one of the phone chargers didn't work to charge the phone battery at all so I have used the second phone charger to charge both phones batteries.I would like to know if you can change the phone charger and at the same time I would like to buy two extra phone chargers for these two 2 BLU Dash JR W D141w Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM... phones.About the phones performance:One of the phones lost the phone directory I wrote into its own memory. I have written it again.The second phone works properly but it isn't able to keep the date for a long time so I have to write it over again now and then.Out of these troubles they are working properly as expected.Thanks for your timeGustavo Pern√≠a
