I was really happy with this at first. It definitely helped me be aware of my posture and it was comfortable to wear. I've been wearing it a little more than a week and today I noticed it didn't feel as tight. Well it's not because it's already working. Upon inspection I noticed that one side looks like it's starting to come apart. I mean I know it's stretched that's what they are supposed to do but I was hoping it would be a little bit more durable.This is my first time using a waist trainer so I picked this one for the price just to see how I felt about the whole concept of waist training. I liked it so much that I ordered this same waist trainer in black (the first one is an off white color). I wanted one for lighter colored clothes but I also have some darker clothing that is sheer so the light colored waist trainer would be very obvious. And I also figured I could alternate them so they wouldn't get too stretched out too quickly.Well a little more than a week and the first one is clearly not going to last. It isn't too small I made sure I was realistic about what size to order. I got an XL and it fit very comfortably. They longest I wore it for in one day was 8 hours.so for starting out $10 isn't a huge investment and I'm glad I tried it out. But this particular waist trainer won't hold up for long. Knowing that I will go for a better quality product.
