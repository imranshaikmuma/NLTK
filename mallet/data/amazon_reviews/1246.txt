I bought these to go with a bustier with garter and they were a perfect fit.  Even after one of my bustier garter clasps broke I could still wear these with the bustier because of the rubber inside the top.  They stay up perfectly.  My husband LOVES touching my legs in these things so I plan on getting a few more pairs to have as needed.
