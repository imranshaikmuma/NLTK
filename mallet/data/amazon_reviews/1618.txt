I purchased this spray after ruining my favorite red leather shoes in a huge storm. I have now treated all of my nicer shoes and purse and none of them were discolored. For some of my shoes I was concerned that the white rim would be discolored so I used painters tape to cover them before spraying and this did the trick. I haven't tested how waterproof my items are but I can say that red pink orange turquoise and green leather and pink and turquoise fabrics all did just fine in terms of keeping the color.
