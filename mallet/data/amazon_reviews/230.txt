As a serious digital photography hobbyist since 2000 I use a Nikon D3100 and a 55-300 lens among others. For pocket cameras I've had several Canons over the last 8 years. My S95 goes along with me almost always. Now the SX40HS blows me away! The zoom range while retaining image quality and camera user friendliness is unbelievable. The lens alone is worth the price. The surprise that got me (and I thought I knew everything!) was the value of the electronic viewfinder (EVF). While not the highest resolution and a bit tricky to center your eye on the EVF allows easy shot confirmation without taking your eye away from it zooming in to check sharpness and exposure even in full sunlight where evaluating a washed out LCD image while composing or in playback would be difficult.  Of course there's always a trade-off - it's hardly a pocket camera. But carried in a light jacket pocket or a medium sized purse you can still have near DSLR versatility with less weight and a smaller size. The 12Mp resolution (vs. 16Mp) keeps the image from falling apart at high ISO's as well as Canon's ability to retain detail with noise reduction using Digic 5 processing.
