I purchased this based on a particular review and I am glad I did. I treated all of our suede/faux suede with this product and we've had no leaks in the last 8 or so weeks. I sprayed the kids' Merrell loafers my Solomon winter "shoes" and my daughter's and my faux Uggs (Costco) and we've all been in wet weather.I sprayed twice as recommended. I did this outside (and left them out there for about four hours after) because there would not be enough ventillation inside especially in the winter. Plus it's got to have _something_ unhealthy in it and I don't want that even lingering in my home. (Plus we have 4 cats and this would defintiely irritate their lungs).The spray's smell is very strong. Make sure you are upwind. Also watch how you spray. I wore an old shirt I didn't mind ruining and the spray did get on it and my hand just a little. But I can't even tell now--no problem in either case.I recommended spraying a little extra on the seams including where the suede meets the rubber at the bottom.I am not sure when I will need to treat again to avoid leaks.Don't do what my friend did with a similar product. Don't lay out your rain clothes (slicker and pants) on the deck and spray them. After they dry and you pick them up and then it rains you will have an outline of a body.
