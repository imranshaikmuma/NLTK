As far as portable 15.6-inchers go this one's not bad. However you are being deceived.This laptop advertises a screen resolution of 4K UHD 3840x2160 but that isn't a complete truth. It's using what's called the RG/BW Pentile matrix a cheap trick to achieve the ability to advertise as 3840x2160 without actually achieving the full detail of the resolution itself. You can do a web search on this type of display to learn all you'd like but without getting too technical here it basically means even though the screen makes your computer render this resolution you don't get to see all that detail on your screen because it's missing half of its pixels.Lots of reviews talk about how nice the display is. The reason for that is because many people buying new laptops today will have had old laptops with the old standard 1366x768 TN displays. This is a huge upgrade from those but so are all the normal 1080p IPS displays you can get in other laptops half this price. Real 4K UHD 3840x2160 resolution is a huge upgrade from THIS display and it is a disrespect to laptops that do truly achieve the resolution that this one gets to advertise right along side them. It's not close to the tier of real-4K displays and not even as good as the 3K 2880x1620 displays available in some laptops such as the older ASUS UX51vz.In my opinion you should not buy this laptop. The Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo Y700 UHD both offer the same GPU but have a real 3840x2160 display. The ASUS may have more RAM or a bigger SSD but those should be low priority in your decision process because they can be easily installed after-market whereas you're pretty much stuck with this display. The Dell XPS 15 and Lenovo Y700 UHD are truly worthy choices whereas the ASUS UX501 thrives on deception. Don't buy it.I have attached two images to this review. One is a closeup of the Dell XPS 15's display and one is a closeup of a false-4K display such as the one in this laptop. Notice how only every other pixel can contribute to each primary color.
