Got camera yesterday 4/25/16; nice compliment with my Nikon 600 F4; pics are sharp focus fast and this is the camera Nikon should hit the ball out of the park with for wildlife nature and sports. Dynamic range and iso are very good as well.Focus is quick and shutter sound is quieter than I thought-Love it!Kevin
