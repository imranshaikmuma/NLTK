I think i found my new favorite jacket.Im always looking for Carhartt jackets or coats and i had the J140 which is basically the same but the outer shell is not as soft.This model is sandstone and is much softer and has a weathered look.The liner is quilted which is much thicker than blanket or thermal lined types.Quilt (and Sherpa) liners are much more comfortable when wearing short sleeve shirts.Its not as heavy as my other coats and yet keeps me nice and toasty even if its 30 deg outside.I can even wear this in colder climate if i layer it with a long sleeve thermal shirt which i prefer than a big bulky jacket.In my experience Carhartt will last you a long time even if you abuse it and this one is no exception.I have a barn coat that i use at work for 11 years and still going strong.You pay a little bit more for this jacket but if it last you a lifetime so what.EditWent up to the mountains today... snow30 deg. and 50 mph gust.It was cold as hell but this jacket blocked the wind and kept me warm.All i had was a long sleeve t shirt underneath and i was comfortable.Definitely recommended to anybody looking for a warm jacket that is not too bulky.I really want another one with a different color coz i liked it so much.Just be aware that Carhartt makes another jacket exactly like this but its not sandstone.Its just as good but this kind is a much softer outer shell.
