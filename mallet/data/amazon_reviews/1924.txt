Excellent Laptop for the Money. Searched long and hard before choosing this laptop - had it for about 2 months now with no problems at all.Dedicated video card lets me play World of Warcraft and Eve Online at high settings with excellent framerates. Came with an empty second Hard Drive bay that was plug in play to add another Sata Laptop hardrive. Installed in seconds removed like 5 tiny screws inserted the new drive and doubled my space. The i7 processor is wicked fast lets me run AutoCAD with multiple Firefox tabs open while editing word and excel documents all at the same time with no problems. Be aware it is a Matte screen which is perfect for gaming in sunlight (no glare) but if you are used to one of the UHD type screens it will look a bit faded in comparison. There is also a trick - in the bottom right use the Nvidia Control Panel to utilize the dedicated video card otherwise the laptop defaults to the integrated Intel chip for most operations. I use the dedicated Nvidia card for the gaming and CAD stuff and let the intel chip run the rest.*Note - this is a real computer not like those other Amazon listed scams that are too good to be true where the folks ask you to pre-approve your email before making you buy with gift cards or whatever.
