I LOVE this camera! True it is my first DSLR (background in film SLR however so I was able to pick up most functions of this camera pretty quickly) but this thing is amazing. I actually bought a used one from here on Amazon a stressful experience considering how much money was involved. I could not be happier with my purchase and getting this level of camera at the price I was able to find it here was pretty amazing. This also allowed me to pick up the 18-135mm zoom lens. In hindsight I wish I would have opted for the 50mm and 28mm primes first. They are faster (larger aperture = more light coming in = more versatile lens for low light and such). I have since picked up the f1.8 50mm also a great find.I was looking for a camera that would allow me to grow with it. This absolutely fits that bill. Unless you are looking to shoot a full frame this camera will probably do far more than what you need. I highly recommend it.
