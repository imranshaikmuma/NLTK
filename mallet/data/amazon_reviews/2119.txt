Needed a computer for college so I figured I'd get the best. Works fast and allows me to easily switch between items. The touch bar is a awesome feature that has built in features for different programs. You can also customize it for programs so it has what you need right at your fingertips. Light and thin. Slips into my backpack easily. The graphics are amazon thanks the the Retina display.
