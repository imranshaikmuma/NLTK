The first time i ordered these socks they were nice fit nice and i really liked them only thing was they were stitched together a little lousy and there were strings hanging. I ordered 2 more packs because i liked them and was hoping the stitching would be better instead i got a diffrent kinda socks but similar. The new socks had good stitching were the old socks had bad stitching. On the new socks up were the toes are its as if its just strands of string holding the toe peice to the rest of the sock looks to rip very easily but the old socks are like reinforced at tht part.... so its like what was bad on the old socks are good on new socks and whats bad on new socks are good on old socks.... sorry if this is little confusing!
