Works exactly as described. I used one can for six pairs of boots 2 coats each as instructed. 4 of those 6 were knee-high boots so I think you could easily do 10-12 pairs of shorter shoes/boots with one can. All of my boots are synthetic including two pairs that are synthetic suede (black and gray). The only boots that changed color a bit were a pair of "cheap" PU boots from Target which went from a light brownish-gray to a darker brownish-gray. However those boots already had dark water stains around the toes and so spraying them actually made them uniform in color and better-looking. After letting everything dry for 2 days I wore those Target boots out in the rain for a test run (before risking the nicer boots). Success! Dry feet and the boots looked fine afterward. Will be ordering more of this to do a few other shoes.Definitely use it outside though -- it smells very strong. I brought the boots inside after 12 hours because I didn't want to leave them out beside the backdoor overnight. I put them in the bathroom and closed the door (to keep cats away from them) and bathroom was VERY stinky very fast and made me lightheaded if I didn't run the fan while I was in there. But it aired out quickly and the smell dissipated once the boots were removed.
