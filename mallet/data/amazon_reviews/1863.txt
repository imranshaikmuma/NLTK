I have always had fairly high end desktop computers - always with Intel (where I once worked) and Nvidia (with which I worked) processors.  I continually upgrade motherboards CPU's and graphics boards something that can't be done with laptops.  Recently I have been looking for a laptop computer that I would find useful with a limited budget and at $800 it is difficult to imagine a better bargain than this Dell Inspiron i7559-763.  I made a leap of faith and ordered this computer before it was even released - something I have never before done.  So far it has been fast and reliable and I am definitely happy with my decision.  It even runs cool and quiet.  Other high points for me are:- Intel i5-6300HQ processor- Nvidia GTX 960M GPU- Bright sharp IPS screen- Backlit keyboard- SSDWhen I received this laptop I discovered another feature that I definitely appreciate.  There is a large hatch on the bottom of the computer that can be opened with a single screw (and without breaking any seals).  This hatch provides easy access to the memory and AN EMPTY SLOT FOR A DISK DRIVE WITH A CONNECTOR CABLE WAITING!  The only hesitancy I had about the features of this computer was the limited storage space on the included SSD (i.e. 256GB) but that is now a non-issue with the easy addition of another SSD in the future.  I even temporarily installed a 2.5 inch HD I had lying around and verified it would work.  There also appears to be an empty slot for another memory card but I did not test it.One feature I didn't test well is the touchpad.  All touchpads are beneath contempt to me so I always use a mouse.So far this is a great computer and I definitely recommend it.
