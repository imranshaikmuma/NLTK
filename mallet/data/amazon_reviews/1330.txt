I love this under scrub shirt.  Snug to the body but not sucking the air out.  Just what I wanted to go under my scrubs.  I don't like lose sleeves so this is great.  Long enough to tuck in and not crawl up when I'm bending and shifting.  Moves with me!  I'm a bit on the heavy side and it doesn't look like I'm wrapped in saran wrap either.  Can't wait to purchase other colors.  Good quality and price!
