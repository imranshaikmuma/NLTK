This really is an amazing camera at a very reasonable price. I am just breaking into the photography industry and sometimes when I am around other photographers I feel a little embarrassed that my camera my not be a big or impressive as theirs but then I see my photos and I know this camera is just what I need. Photo quality is so much about the lens and settings that you likely don't need a very expensive or bulky body to get started. Some day I may upgrade but for now I will continue to spend my money on glass. I bought a 35mm f/1.8 prime lens and it took my photos to a whole new level. Invest in a good lens!Anyway a few more details. The camera is incredibly lightweight which I love. The body is also very comfortable in my hands and easy to use. My only complaint is that the back-button focus feature assigns the AE lock button as the focus button and it doesn't seem to work quite right. Sometimes the focus works great and other times it locks my photos and I miss the focus. I am not sure why this is happening but I wish there was a separate back-button focus.
