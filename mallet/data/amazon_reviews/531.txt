About every two to three years I buy a "pocket camera" to use in our worldwide travels.  I find that after that time carrying in my pocket I have worn them all out.  The quality of the Canon pictures and videos taken particularly without a flash even when in very low ambient light is outstanding.  That is for pics not so much for HD videos.  The video is excellent with good lighting.  The Canon brand is proving to be better than the other popular brand I have purchased the last three times.All photos and video far surpass anything I can take with a highly rated most popular cell phone.  I use the phone to make phone calls e-mails and texting.
