I ordered the 40x30 as I know with Dickies I need to go 1 to 2 sizes up.  I'm glad I decided with the 40 over the 38 a little loose but I feel the 38 would have been snug.  How ever the length of 30 is inaccurate.  They feel as a 32 or even 34 as I need to cuff the bottom so I don't walk on the bottom of the pants.  Yes they are loose fit but I feel that they are more so baggy than loose.  I also am sort of disappointed with the material.  All the Dickies that in have bought over the years are very stiff thick material these are noticably thinner or light weight compared to the originals.  The pockets feel more sturdy and solid than the pants themselves.
