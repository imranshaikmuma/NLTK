I have been wearing my size 8 Lee's relaxed fit straight leg jeans for many years and loved them. The "Long" size option is great and I appreciate the higher natural waist. But sadly these jeans are now made of a different thinner fabric--they feel more like stretch pants and the fabric is NOT FORGIVING. It emphasizes every dimple on my thighs. Eeek! I am so disappointed that I will now have to find a new brand of jeans to fit my ample hips and thighs and smaller waist.  Why change a classic that was very popular?? Bummer.
