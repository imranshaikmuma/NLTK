Just received this yesterday and started shooting today. My first Camera other than an iPhone so I am a 100% novice but wanted something I could grow with. Amazing photo quality! I will post the first day photos I captured today all on automatic setting. I did not change any settings and I must say I am amazed at how well this camera adjusts for shutter speeds and aperture size. The auto focus on both works amazingly well and I don't see the need for any other lens JUST yet. This bundle came with a software CD called viewNX2 and I'm not sure what it does other than shading and cropping...haven't really spent time on it yet but I do like the fact that it shows every spec/dynamic of each photo that you take...ie...shutter speed / aperture / focus setting / ISO / where the focus points were!  The Bag is well made with a handful of different size Velcro pieces to allow the user to compartmentalize the space how they see fit. The bird photo was at 300mm. And the picture of my girls was about 230 mm. The holly tree branch was at 55mm on the 18-55. Again I don't know enough about photography yet to go manual so these were all point and shoot.
