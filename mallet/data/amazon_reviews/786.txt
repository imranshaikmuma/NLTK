I purchased this refurbished phone on Amazon and began using it in March of 2016. It's now October 2016 and it's virtually useless. Two things were immediately wrong with the phone. First the back was significantly scratched up and did not appear new as promised. It was just cosmetic and I was going to use a case so I didn't freak out. It is after all a refurbished phone. Also since receiving the phone I have never been able to use it while it's plugged in. I didn't discover this until I already had it outside of the US so I decided it wasn't worth the effort of getting it back to the US to exchange it. Now it makes me wonder if that was the first sign of the problems that I am now having. About a week ago the phone started randomly turning off and saying that it had a low battery in the middle of the day (it had previously lasted all day easily). I would plug it in and when it turned back on it would say it was 40% charged still. This has gotten progressively worse each day until yesterday it began turning off after less than an hour while being 100% charged. I have tried restoring it along with various other suggestions on the internet but it's not a software problem. When I removed the OtterBox that I'd been using I discovered that the screen is coming off leading me to conclude that the battery is swelling (which would cause both the screen to detach and the phone to act as previously described). I have talked to the Authorized Apple repair technicians here in the country where I live but they won't touch it if it's believed to be a swollen battery. They say that opening it will likely mean they couldn't close it again it could cause someone harm and that replacing the battery here costs 80% of the cost of a new phone anyway. Because it's refurbished and beyond the 90 days of guarantee I have no recourse with Apple or the seller here. So after only 7 months I have a very expensive paperweight. Proceed with caution.
