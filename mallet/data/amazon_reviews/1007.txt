After having the phone ( Blu Vivo XL) for just under 6 months it has stopped charging properly and when attached to a computer it no longer sees the phone as an external storage device. Three of us in my neighborhood purchased this model at abut the same time last summer and all of them are doing the same thing. I contacted Blu and they will not honor their warranty since it was an open box. I liked the phone until it and a the others owned by friends started doing this. I will not buy another.
