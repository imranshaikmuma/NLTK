** This review is for the 15-inch model that has several key differences from the 13-inch model.Some of the differences that may not be obvious:1. 15-inch does NOT include a backlit keyboard. 13-inch does include one.2. 15-inch has a MicroSD card slot. 13-inch model has a standard SD card slot.3. 15-inch has a USB-C port. 13-inch model has a micro-HDMI port instead.4. 15-inch has a standard HDMI port. 13-inch has a mini-VGA port.5. 15-inch has 4-cell Lithium-polymer battery. 13-inch has 2-cell Lithium-ion battery.6. 15-inch has 2-Watt stereo speakers. 13-inch has 1.5-Watt stereo speakers.7. 15-inch supports Intel WiDi. 13-inch does not.8. 15-inch comes with a dongle that gives you Gigabit Ethernet LAN. It connects to a dedicated port on the left side of the laptop. I could not confirm if the 13-inch model includes this dongle or not.I received the larger 15-inch model to review. After opening the Amazon package the biggest surprise for me about this laptop was its model name written on the box. The box it came in had “Samsung ATIV Book 9” written on it. So unknown to me this appears to be the same product line as Samsung’s ATIV series laptops. This was surprising to me because nowhere in the description of this laptop here on Amazon do they mention “ATIV”. What was also confusing is that other than the box it came in the word “ATIV” does not appear anywhere on the laptop itself. The model listed on its back is “NP900X5L”. So this is somewhat confusing.Other than the fact that this is Samsung’s ATIV series laptop there were no other surprises. The laptop looks exactly like the one pictured here on Amazon’s product page.Regarding the backlit keyboard: The 15-inch model that I received does NOT have a backlit keyboard. I also searched but could not find “backlit keyboard” listed as a feature anywhere in the description here on Amazon or Samsung’s product page. The confusion around backlit keyboard is likely because it appears that the 13-inch model includes it but the 15-inch one does not.*** The Good ***1. Weight - The first thing you’ll notice as you take it out of the box is its lack of weight. I have an 11-inch MacBook Air and this 15-inch Samsung laptop weighs noticeably lighter. It weighs about 2.9 lbs.2. Screen - The laptop has an absolutely stunning Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution! After its weight this is probably the most likable feature of this laptop. I also like the very thin bezel area around the display. This makes the screen really pop out making full-screen viewing much more enjoyable.3. Thinness - I don’t think it is the thinnest laptop but it is definitely one of the thinnest ones I have seen. I think its thinness is even more obvious with the 15-inch model. You can easily fit it in a manila envelope if it was wide enough to fit its width.4. Solid State Drive (SSD) - Although its drive is only 256 GB the good thing is that this is a solid state drive. Solid state drives are much faster than the older magnetic drives. Windows starts in seconds and everything is snappier because of the fast drive.5. Keyboard - Although the keyboard on the 15-inch model is not backlit I still love the keyboard on this laptop. Ergonomically it’s very easy to type on. It’s also possible that I like the keyboard on this laptop because it’s very similar to the MacBook Pro keyboard that I am used to.6. USB-C Support - This laptop is future-proof with the inclusion of USB-C port. USB-C is the next generation interface that will replace the popular micro-USB mini-USB and USB interfaces. USB-C is also expected to replace popular display ports like HDMI and Apple’s Thunderbolt. USB-C is anticipated to be widely available and supported by the majority of device manufacturers. Apple’s newest 12-inch MacBook also includes this port. Some of the newest cell phones (Nexus 5X/6P) and other electronic devices already include USB-C support. I love the fact that Samsung is including USB-C port on this laptop. Please note that only the 15-inch model has USB-C port. The 13-inch model includes a micro HDMI port instead.7. MicroSD slot - I like that Samsung included a MicroSD card slot - even though I would have preferred a standard SD card slot (See #1 under ‘The Ugly’). A lot of smaller cameras and cell phones include a MicroSD card slot so having this slot gives you quick access to transfer photos videos and documents.8. TouchPad - The touchpad is better than most Windows laptops I have used. I guess Samsung is trying to replicate the look and feel of Apple MacBook with these laptops. The touchpad looks very similar to MacBooks’ but when it comes to functionality it falls short. It’s not as responsive as MacBooks’ but definitely more responsive than some of the other Windows laptops I have seen in this price range. The touchpad recognizes multi-finger gestures. I’m used to scrolling pages with two finger swipes on the touchpad and it works really well on this touchpad. You can also customize the 4-finger tap and other gestures.*** The Bad ***1. Storage - If you like to store a lot of media locally on the laptop the mere 256 GB drive may not cut it. You will have to resort to either cloud-based storage or an external USB 3.0 drive. The slim body design of this laptop makes it difficult to upgrade and swap the drive if you are a do-it-yourself person like me.2. Backlit Keyboard - I do like backlit keyboards on laptops. They help you work in the dark. I think backlit keyboard should be standard on high-end laptops. Unfortunately this 15-inch model does not include a backlit keyboard so if this is a huge negative for you I do not recommend buying this model. The 13-inch model appears to include a backlit keyboard so you may check that out instead.*** The Ugly ***1. No SD card slot - Most laptops include an SD card slot but this one includes a MicroSD card slot - something I have not seen in a laptop before. Although it’s a good thing that Samsung included at least a MicroSD slot but not having access to a built-in standard SD card slot can be an issue for many who regularly transfer photos and videos from their cameras. A lot of cameras still use the standard SD cards. If the laptop had an SD card slot you could use an adapter and still use a MicroSD card but not the other way around. This means that if you want to transfer pictures/videos from an SD card you will have to use a SD-card to USB adapter similar to this one that I use regularly: Transcend USB 3.0 Card Reader. If you must absolutely have a built-in SD card slot you may consider the 13-inch model that includes it.The current price (of under $1200) for the 15-inch model is about right where it should be for a laptop with the features included with this one. Although it does not include an SD card slot you’ll still be able to transfer media and files if you use MicroSD cards. I also do not consider the lack of backlit keyboard to be such a huge issue (for me) given the fact that this is a very light laptop perfect for use on battery when traveling.Overall this is an excellent laptop. I highly recommend it if you need a thin lightweight Windows 10 laptop.=== UPDATE 03/18/2016 ===With some Windows laptops you get a lot of bloatware/junkware/crapware (whatever you prefer to call it) or even spyware. I think Microsoft has tried to control (to some extent) what gets installed on these laptops by manufacturers (such as Samsung). In the days of Windows XP/7 whenever I bought a new Windows laptop for myself or someone else the first thing I used to do was clean-install Windows or manually remove as many of those unwanted software as I possibly could.With this laptop the only unwanted application that I needed to uninstall was the Norton Anti-Virus. Microsoft Windows 10 comes with a solid antivirus and firewall (called Windows Defender) that is natively installed and fully supported and updated by Microsoft. You do not need any additional antivirus utilities. The Norton software that came with it was a 30-day trial that started bugging me to pay for subscription right from the start so I wasted no time in getting rid of the nagware. After I uninstalled it and rebooted the laptop Windows Defender took over downloaded updated definitions and started a quick scan to make sure everything was okay. Perfect!=== UPDATE 03/21/2016 ===When I wrote the review the selling price here on Amazon for the 15-inch model was about $1200. Currently it is selling for $1100 while the 13-inch is still listed for $1000. With only a $100 difference I recommend getting the newer 15-inch model if not having a backlit keyboard and standard SD card slot is not a huge issue.The laptop seems to hold its charge well except for when playing HD videos. Since the video memory is shared if you play a lot of high definition videos the i7 processor goes into overdrive and uses more power.I also wanted to let people know which sleeve fits it. I first ordered the 15-inch AmazonBasics sleeve but that turned out to be too large for it. The AmazonBasics 14-Inch Laptop Sleeve fits the 15-inch laptop perfectly. If you are looking for a sleeve this one is great choice.Overall this is a great laptop and I cannot recommend it enough.=== UPDATE 03/31/2016 ===I have been putting this laptop to work to test and see if it can ever replace my personal MacBook Pro that I use regularly. This laptop's thin design and paper-light weight makes me want to keep coming back to it. It is just too enticing! :)Here are some additional thoughts as I continue to use it:The battery seems to hold up. As with any laptop manufacturer you will likely never achieve the advertised run-time (i.e. 12-hour) with this one. The only way to achieve it would be to not do multi-tasking have only one application open (like the Edge browser) and not use any multimedia.I had this laptop charged in the morning and used it throughout the day for several hours - not continuously but on and off. I primarily browsed but also watched news videos on CNN and MSNBC as well some YouTube videos. The battery is pretty good. I even forgot that it was not plugged in until it warned me when only 10% was remaining. I would say that the battery lasts about as long as my MacBook's. If your normal workflow is not more than 30% multimedia consumption the battery on this can last the whole day easily but you have to be extremely conservative about the apps you allow it to run in the background.Lastly since it has a Type C USB port and because several devices including I think Google's Pixel and the 12-inch MacBook laptops can be charged using their USB-C ports I was curious to see if this laptop can also do the same trick. But sadly USB-C port doesn't charge this laptop at all. Not a huge disappointment because this is an not advertised feature. However it would have been really great if Samsung allowed it to be charged using the USB-C port in addition to the supplied AC adapter.
