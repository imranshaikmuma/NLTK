I purchased my k3ii from Amazon. I have had the istD K10 K20 K7 K5 K5iis.  I am a Pentaxian. I first thought that I would wait for the K 1 after my wonderful time over 2 years with the k5iis.  What the k3ii does is perfect the aps-c format.  I am doing things with this camera that I could not do with the k5iis.  The Video interval mode at 4K is tremedous.  I have done short films at 1 min intervals on garden items up to 8 hrs.  How fun to have the movie already made  I just use Windows moviemaker to speed up or slow down.  Having up to 9 fps has been fantastic for sports work and the pixel shift for still life's is unmatched.  I did not buy the k3 as it was not better than the k5iis.  The k3ii is and I have no issue with the missing flash but love having the gps built in.  I likely will get a k1 when they update it to fully match the features of the k3ii in 18 months and the price comes down.  Pentax is the leading innovator now  and after 32 years with Pentax I look forward to its future
