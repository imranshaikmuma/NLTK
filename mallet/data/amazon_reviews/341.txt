If you're looking for a more-than-capable camera whether it be for ultra-zoom or even because you aren't quite sure you want to make the investment for a DSLR (with all the lenses and such) I think this camera is hard to beat. I've been using it for months now and it is hands down my go-to for every day shooting. The menus are jam-packed with functionality and if you're like me post-processing is minimal in most situations. I love this camera and it has truly increased my confidence level in taking stunning pictures...It's a blast to play with and to find just what 'style' you prefer for images. I can't say enough good things about it!! As a matter of fact I can't really come up with a negative at this point.
