For the price I think this is a great camera for activities. Although I was nervous after reading the reviews that the camera's plastic casing was poor quality mine camera has held up. I have taken this camera tubing biking and snorkeling. The pictures have turned out very nice and clear and the videos are good for capturing the moment. The only disappointmentsI have with the camera is the sound and bluetooth connection. Because of how you hold the camera the sound doesn't really come through clearly or if you're moving there is a lot of static. The wifi/bluetooth connection to my iphone didn't work at all for me unless I was on a secure network. When I was on my last trip I had no way of looking at my photos until I could get access to a computer with an SD reader (luckily I had my micro SD card adapter with me). With that said I am not a technology wiz so maybe it was a user area. Unfortunately I thought disconnecting and reconnecting the camera from my phone would help but then forget that you have to enter a code that's given in the original packaging. Still have not reconnected my camera. Once I can figure out this feature though I think I will use the camera a lot more since I can share pictures or stream live.Again I would definitely recommend this camera as an easy activities camera that's fun to use to capture the moment.
