I do alot of walking at least an hour or so in the morning and evening.  I read the reviews before I bought these and most of them were good.  I figured ASICS is a good brand and they have Gel in them.  They literally KILLED my feet!!  GEL?  WHERE?  I had them on my feet for less than 20 minutes and I was limping back to my house.  I returned them right away!  The best shoes I have are Fila running shoes with memory foam very comfortable!  I also have a few pairs of Sketchers (shape-ups Di Lites and Sketch-Air) that are by far more comfortable than these Asics Women's Gel-venture.
