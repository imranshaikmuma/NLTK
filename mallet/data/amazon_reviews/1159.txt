One day pants will become obsolete because of leggings like these. ;-) Comfort quality and style at an affordable price? Count me in! These yoga capris are surprisingly comparable to the pricey pairs I own. I wear a medium and am 5'7" and 135 pounds.I ordered three colors in this capri. In the attached photo of the three folded capris from right to left the colors are Navy Blue SD Blue Grey SD and Black.Pros- NOT see through if you order the correct size. If these are see-through on you you're either seeing the white liners underneath some styles or need to size up- Cut fits bigger booties and hips- hooray!- You can do all the yoga poses your heart desires in these and not have to worry about these leggings riding down in the back- Patterns are even more vibrant and beautiful in person- Flexible fabric that allows for a wide range of movement- Fabric doesn't get that heavy or soggy feel when you sweat during intense exercise or hot yoga- With the exception of the solid black fabric these fabrics do not show pet hair.Cons- Some patterns have white lining inside which makes the fabric look a little cheap when stretched. The blue/grey style I ordered does not have white lining.- Pet hair clings to solid black fabric
