I got my Moto G and it was a great device for about 60 days. Then it developed a “ghost touch” like an unseen person was randomly operating the screen. During these more increasingly frequent events I cannot gain control of the device or even turn it off. Amazon doesn’t want the device back after 30 days and Lenovo the maker of the device tells you to try this and if that doesn’t work try this and if that doesn’t resolve the problem  try this other thing and if that doesn’t work well go back to the first suggestion.Pros: It hasn’t exploded.Cons: Can’t be used as a cell phone or tabletI have not be paid or accepted any merchandise by Amazon or its suppliers for this review.
