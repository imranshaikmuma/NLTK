Cons:Camera is very poor resolution 0.3 MP. Also the cable is very floppy.I found the cable  pretty much useless trying to fish it down inside an engine compartment.I'll sell this one on e-bay and buy the Giraffe Cam 3.0 Rigid next time.Pro:Quality of the product is good the button on the cable is a nice feature. Although a shutter sound would be helpful.Free software was easy to download from Google play.
