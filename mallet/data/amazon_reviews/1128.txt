Let me start by saying this is my husbands account but I placed the order.I got the 2xl and it was to small.I am 5"9 and 220 pounds.It is a amazing product and I love it I just can not fit in the 2xl right now.I contacted the company and they are sending me a 4xl which I know will fit great.I tried contacting amazon about it being to small and they were very rude and refused to help in anywayso glad I contacted Yianna about this problem they had a very fast response time and treated me with respect.I will be keeping the 2xl because I know it will fit soon enough.It is soft material and I love the way it looksalso it is nice and strong material.I have a long torso and this is the right length for it.They have the best costumer service I have ever encountered.Yianna is a great company and I plan on ordering another one of these after I am done with the 2xl.I look forward to ordering more of their products in the future.
