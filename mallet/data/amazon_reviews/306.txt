Have been enjoying this camera ever since I got it! The photos look great and the videos are a bit lower in quality but not to the point where it's just pixilated still looks nice.The build of the camera feels very sturdy though it's advised to still handle with care and though it does come with a pouch I highly recommend getting a hard case for it due to the dual lenses.Just as technology goes a better version of this will more than likely be out by next year though if you're hesitant on the current 360 degree cameras to buy today highly recommend this one. Feels nice looks nice and is slim to easily slide into your pocket unlike the others that are much more bulky.**Also one more thing (I may save a life with this review) when you download the PC/Mac application of Ricoh's software to view your photos and videos in a 360 degree view MAKE SURE you have the latest version of Adobe Air downloaded. Many users weren't able to get their application to launch and we're not aware they needed Adobe Air support. Hope that may help if you are lost!**
