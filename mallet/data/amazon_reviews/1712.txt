I have been an operating room nurse for over 25 years and I have worn scrubs since I was 19 years old so needless to say I know what works and what is comfortable in a setting where you need your apparel to work well.  The 4-way stretch collection by Wonder Wink is absolutely hands down the most attractive best-constructed easiest to launder and maintain most comfortable scrubs on the market.  I have tried them all and am totally  sold on them!!  They can be worn right out of the washer practically with little to no drying required.  The fabric feels good against your skin and I have see nurses and technicians of all shapes and sizes wear them and look very attractive in them.  Even though we OR nurses aren't seen in a high profile setting my patients have commented on how attractive these scrubs are!  The cut topstitching details and carefully placed cargo pockets make wearing these scrubs a dream!  I highly recommend!
