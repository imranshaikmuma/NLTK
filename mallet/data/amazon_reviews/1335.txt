I like this shirt to wear under my scrubs. I have a similar shirt made by another brand that I like much better due to the material it is made from. This Adar shirt is a cotton long sleeved tee shirt that is thin enough to work well under scrubs without overheating you. There is not a lot of stretch to it at all which is why it's not my absolute favorite but I do like this shirt. I ordered a large to afford me a little bit of room in the shirt and I'd say it fits as expected. I am a bit larger in the chest area and am pleased with the fit. I would definitely order other colors in this shirt. For the price it cannot be beat.
