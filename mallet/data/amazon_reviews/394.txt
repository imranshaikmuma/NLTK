Purchased for my Mother for her first trip to Japan.  My mom is not very technologically savvy. I allowed her to figure out how to use the camera and its' features on her own - partly to determine the user friendliness of the product but also to get her to embrace technology.She found the camera very easy to use and managed not only to take beautiful pictures of Japan but also bring back some video from her trip too!Attached is a photo she took with the camera.  Beautiful isn't it?!
