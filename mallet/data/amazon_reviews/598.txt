For some reason this camera never worked- it was a Christmas present and it was sad it didn't work--- unfortunately my girlfriend just gave it back.  So I guess it is out of warranty.  Sonya wants to charge $70 bucks to fix it.  but I bought in new for $90-  and it never worked.  crazy world... sometimes you should buy in a store- to see if things work...  I wasted $90
