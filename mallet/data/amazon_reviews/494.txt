I am so disappointed with this camera. I had the previous model and it worked great; it took fair photographs. I bought this one to replace that when it broke. The image quality is so poor that you can take better photos using a smart phone (I'm not kidding). I don't know what Sony did to the sharpness... all photos I took using this camera are just blah. They increased the amount of megapixels but I guess the sensor and/or lenses are of inferior quality than Sony's previous standards?
