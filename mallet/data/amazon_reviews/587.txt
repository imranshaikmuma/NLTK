I had the chance to test the RX100 Mark II agains the Canon G1X Mark II and as soon I started using the RX100 Mark II I understood why it's gained so much attention. It is a really nice little compact camera with excellent image quality faster AF and shot-to-shot speed than the G1X MKII.The faster AF can be a bit deceiving though since whenever it feels challenged by the scene it has to focus instead of trying to lock focus on a small spot it just increases the focus area by a huge amount and does a general large area focus which isn't as precise and you can end up with your intended focal area slightly out of focus.I liked the menu design better than the G1X Mark II with more tabs instead of extremely long scrolling list. The number of buttons and dials and customizability is very similar between the two cameras.While the size of the RX100 Mark II is actually pocketable like I already mentioned I have no need or desire to pocket an electronic device -- I much rather use a shoulder-sling pouch. There are a lot of people who do want to pocket their electronic devices though so its small size is one of its most attractive points.The image quality on this little guy is so nice that it competes favorably against the G1X MKII. The images have less noise but the difference isn't as meaningful to me since a little noise reduction evens results. You won't get the same level of DOF control though and for some people this is a deal breaker.The other possible deal breaker is the lack of a touchscreen and touch-focus/shutter. The face-recognition helps a lot but when it failed I really wished it had touchscreen shooting. Again the old focus and then recompose or moving the AF point around with physical controls just doesn't cut it anymore when we now have superior methods.For those who don't care about the possible deal breakers of the RX100 Mark II I would recommend it over the G1X Mark II.(And now that RX100 Mark III is out it's an even better camera than Mark II with a built-in EVF. But unfortunately still no touchscreen shooting and it's still an 1" sensor.)If you want to read my review of the G1X Mark II it's here:http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H83DLB5CIXDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I58M1VKBTW I ended up choosing the Olympus OM-D E-M1 over the RX100 Mark II and G1X Mark II.
