When you search here on Amazon it says that Crocs only come in a standard width (left page column 'Refine by: Shoe Width'). That's not entirely true. For some reason Crocs doesn't put EE EEE etc. on their shoes. I've included a JPEG that shows that Crocs come in three different widths. Standard relaxed and roomy.I've been wearing these shoes Propet Men's Life Walker Strap SneakerBlack13 X (US Men's 13 EEE) which are triple E and these Bistro shoes are wider. These are some of the most roomy shoes I've ever had on. It's almost like not wearing a shoe at all. Which is exactly what I wanted.Go to the Crocs website and in the search box type in 'roomy fit.'  You'll get a list of all the shoes that Crocs makes that are roomy fit.
