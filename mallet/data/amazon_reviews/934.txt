I was one of the note 7 casualties and didn't like any other phone Samsung had to offer. I had a 2014 Moto x and loved the phone until the battery crapped out on me so I thought I'd try this Moto z play. The phone is great! I've always loved the features of the Motorola phones and the bare bones Android. I've had the phone a couple months now and love it. I've had no issues and the battery life is phenomenal. I use my phone for everything and still have sometimes over 50% battery at the end of the day. I just moved half way across the country recently and drive two days at 10 hours a piece. I had my GPS on the whole time and had to make multiple phone calls to the other driver and I still had 30%+ battery at the end of the day. I've never had a phone that could do that. This phone doesn't have top of the line specs now top of the line screen but honestly you don't even notice. I've always had the best phone out there and change phones frequently. I thought the lower specs would negatively affect what I do on my phone (make it slower to do things I wanted it to for example) but I've not noticed anything different than the top phones out there. I'm not a heavy gamer on my phone so you might notice if you game a lot. I mostly read articles and do some light gaming. I highly recommend this phone. It's great quality and you can't beat the price!
