I really liked these stockings I ordered the "one-size" but I should have probably gotten the larger one as they were a little tight around my thighs and I did not like how they looked because of it. It did not matter in the end though as the stockings ripped when I caught my foot on something sharp. I am not going to leave a negative review for them ripping though as all women who have worn stockings made out of "traditional" stocking material should know they rip easy and to take precautions. For now I will stick to full waist stockings and stockings with garter belts I feel more comfortable in them and dont have to worry about them falling down as much. If you are interested in buying these just keep in mind one size does not fit all and not to lie to yourself like I did. I am around 5'3 145 pounds.
