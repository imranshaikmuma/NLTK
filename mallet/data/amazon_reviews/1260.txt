I am always a little nervous about order clothes online (due to my obvious non-model figure) - however this tank is fantastic! The color I purchased (charcoal) is gorgeous and true to what is shown the fit is flowy comfortable and it is quite flattering - even on my large frame! The fabric is thin and cool - but not so thing where it is sheer or lacks proper coverage. In my opinion it is the absolute perfect top for those warm days.One of my favorite things about this tank is that while it is perfect to wear during my yoga and workout sessions; I have found that I can easily "dress it up" by layering it over a camisole and wearing it with a maxi skirt and pretty necklace. I threw on a short sleeved shrug and I got tons of compliments from my co-workers on how nice I looked.Now that I know just how fabulous these tanks are I am already purchasing more in different colors to brighten up my summer wardrobe. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a comfortable versatile and great value top!
