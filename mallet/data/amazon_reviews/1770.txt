I have been using these Hanes socks for about two years now and this is my third order. I am very happy with these. These socks are affordable comfortable durable and cut to a size that fits very closely to as-expected.The primary material of these socks are cotton but they also use polyester. The material used is flexible and capable of being stretched without permanently deforming. The padding of these socks are excellent. They give you very good comfort but they also do not make your feet sweat like crazy. An extra durable toe and heavy stitching give you good durability even if you are harder on socks. In fact these hold up just as well as some of the socks I have owned in the past that were over twice the price!!!As other Reviewers have noted like most 'no show' socks they still show with lower cut shoes. This isn't something that bothers me but it is important to note that if you want extremely low fitting socks that do not show at all with lower-cut shoes this may not be the product for you. If that is not a concern then you should be pretty happy with fitment. The 10-13 size is cut so that it is right in the middle of what that size should be so if you know you need a 10-13 or a 6-12 size sock you won't have to worry about fitment "surprises" when these arrive.After the first wash the black colors do NOT bleed easily and these socks are not picky at all when it comes to wash/dry cycles.Overall these Hanes socks are a very good product. Very good performance very good durability and excellent value. I highly recommend!
