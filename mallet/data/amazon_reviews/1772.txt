Honestly I have never imagined in my wildest dreams I would be spending a Friday night writing a review for socks from Hane's no less. But here we are 20 years removed from being a 10 year old. Most teachers ask their students what do you imagine yourself doing as an adult. Well I don't have the dream job or the life I want but my god these socks are pretty good.I took a chance with these socks after wearing some pairs from a different company for the past year.Now I tend to purchase from Hane's but the quality has been declining for past few years. After a few months of usage these socks have held up pretty well. I mainly wear these with size 13 low fashion sneakers or even sneakers with mid tops. So you can imagine I have pretty decent size hobbit feet. The socks have been comfortable and usually stay in place. There have been a few occasions where the sock will ride under the back of the heel but it is due from me not adjusting my sneakers correctly or wearing an irregular size shoe for my feet.
