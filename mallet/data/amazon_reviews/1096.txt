I am 5'4" and 130 pounds on a good day (lol) but closer to 135 pounds in this photo. I bought the pink v-neck in a small and the heathered grey regular neck in a small as well.They are both very light material so the pink is see-through. You can see my black leggings under it and the bumps in my bra too. I love the 3/4 length sleeves and the dolman style but personally I don't love the v-neck on this one as much. The top is tighter in my belly than I thought it would be. I chose the Dolman style because they're usually loose in the tummy but fitted at the hips. This top isn't as loose as I would've liked and I had to really suck the gut in for a decent photo. (I've had two kids so that pooch is harder to hide!)The grey one also has a "J" logo on the bottom left of the shirt on the hip but the pink one doesn't have that. It's kind of annoying and makes the shirt look cheap but you can fold it under to hide it as I did in my picture.I bought another top at the same time from Lock & Love in a small and I was surprised to see that that is the same company as Made by Johnny. That small fit me perfectly though so I think the small in this is right for me I just have more gut than I should and I was sucking it in for the photo! For anyone else around my size I'd recommend ordering a small and a medium to try them both on for size. I'll definitely return the pink one of these because it isn't flattering in this size/color combo on me at all. But if you have a flat stomach than this size is for you! ;)
