I have NEVER liked no-show socks and I was reluctant to try these but they were highly rated and recommended. I love this socks. I will repeat that. I love these socks. They do NOT slip down. Recently wore them for a half marathon in the rain and they did not budge. My new favorite running socks. I want all colors.
