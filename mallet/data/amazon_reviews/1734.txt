This fits as expected.  If you are a 40" suit jacket you'd want a large.  I'm 5' 9" and about 170.  Anything smaller than a large would be too tight on me.  The arms are still a bit snug but it looks good.I have a few of these and I love them the orange is a bit too bright for my taste.  It's bright on the computer but blinding in real life. I may just run in this rather then take the gym.  It's really brightly colored but if that's your thing.  Go for it.
