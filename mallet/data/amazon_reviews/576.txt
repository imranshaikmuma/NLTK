I'm having so much fun with this camera! Time lapse is my favorite - I could play with that all day long! I've also used it to do a live feed to YouTube of my birdfeeder. Temps were in the low 40s and it worked like a champ.My wishlist for the camera would be that- I could connect to the camera while on my home WiFi and not have to use cellular data to do live feeds. I can't imagine anyone has the cell bandwidth to do this more than once or twice a month and I think it's a really great concept. Also I sometimes lose my WiFi connection to the camera and it switches back to the my FiOS connection. It's a bit tedious to go back and forth between settings and the camera app to get it reconnected.- When you create a time lapse just back up the final movie not all the individual photos that made up the movie. I filled my iCloud accidentally because I didn't know it was going to do that. I had to turn off the backup function.- Ability to store photos and videos [offline] in the App instead of my photos.
