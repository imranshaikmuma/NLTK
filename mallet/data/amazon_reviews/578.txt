My wife purchased this for me for my Christmas present.  I have been testing this extensively over the past few months through several tourist trips and local trips.  First be aware that this product does NOT come with an SD card.  The packaging is amazing it could probably survive an earthquake and still arrive ok.  The design of the camera is simple and intuitive.  I recommend that while you are charging the camera that you download the phone app at the same time.  Once the camera is charged power up the device by grabbing it with your hand and point and shoot away.  The quality is excellent great for trips where you will be outdoors for most of the time since once you grab the picture you can crop and zoom as you want.  The pixels are high quality enough to compensate.I gave this product 4-stars for the following reasons:- No iPad app.  The design of the camera requires Bluetooth AND WIFI to be on.  If you are in a foreign country like me all the time that requires you to rely on WIFI this means you have to disconnect from the Internet and connect to the camera depending on the functionality you are looking for.  Making an app that would allow users to multi-task between devices would relieve the issue- WIFI required. Pursuant to the previous comment why does this camera need Bluetooth AND wifi?- Startup issues.  After the initial power-up instructions tell users that all they need to do is grasp the handle of the camera and it will automatically power on.  Sometimes this works and other times it doesn't.  Also one day I was using the device and the battery died in the afternoon after a full night's charge.  Maybe I powered it on too much? There wasn't much usage between the morning and afternoon so this puzzled me a bit.Other than that this camera is a great buy and if you can deal with comments from strangers about creep shots and the device looking weird this will be a good fit for you!
