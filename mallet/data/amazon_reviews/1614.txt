I'm not sure if it works as I had to scrub and put my shoes in the wash machine to remove the ugly yellow color that this product left on my shoes. Don't ruin an expensive pair of shoes. It may be fine on leather is my guess. Maybe it says to test a small area on the product? More than likely it does. Lady Foot Locker sells a shoe protector that I was too lazy to go to the mall and buy. I've used it for a few years. One day I was wearing bright pink Nikes stepped into mud all the way to the top of the shoe. I took the shoe off went to my sink and it rinsed off like it never happened. I'm rating this product at 3 stars I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it doesn't turn leather yellow-ish. Lesson learned I can't buy everything on Amazon.
