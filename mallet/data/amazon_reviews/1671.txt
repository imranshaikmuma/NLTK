If you're reading the reviews about how these run a size large and are going to order a medium as a result STRONGLY consider getting the medium TALL. I bought this for just casual wearing (not doing physical labor or wearing over 3+ layers). I just wanted a nice looking and warm jacket so I got a medium so it wasn't overly big on me. I'm 5'10" and about 190 lbs but I have a longer torso so I'm usually a large. The medium fit me well in the shoulders. However the sleeve and body length were too short. Whenever I bend my arms too much or reached up for something my forearms and stomach were exposed which made me not want to move around a lot in it and I got in the habit of pulling the jacket down to try and make it longer. The medium tall solves this problem. So if you're actually a large in regular jackets/shirts and getting a medium for a tighter fit get a medium tall if you're on the taller side or have a longer torso. The only difference between the medium and medium tall is that the sleeve length and body length for the medium tall are both 2" longer which is perfect.
