My favorite work pant.  Breathes nicely.  Wears well. Washes up nicely retaining color.  Doesn't harbor funky smells.  Quality zipper/hardware.  Cut correctly (see below)Cons:  You can order 10 pairs of 34 x 32 and you may receive 3-4 countries of origin.  Each country has a different idea of what size 34 means.  Meaning the Mexican made pair will fit correctly but the Honduras pair will be too tight.  If you get the Nicaragua made pants they may be too big.  Sizing is all over the map/place.  There needs to be MUCH tighter quality control.
