Everything I knew it would be.  Getting ready to sell my Sony A99.  Love that camera (especially the ability to dial in the exact desired exposure before taking a shot thanks to the EVF) but the D750 has much more control to offer.  Auto ISO Exposure Bracketing and Timer controls are among the top features that I now enjoy much more control over.  The instant on and battery life along with the ability to immediately download a jpg directly from the camera and injected into social media is another major benefit.  Live view operation has been a major disappointment with a serious lag time between shots and it often struggles to focus (85 f1.8 lens).  The Wifi app is a disappointment as well essentially only useful for downloading images and very basic live view image capture.  Will be getting the CamRanger and see how that is.So it's like learning to shoot all over again.  Defintely a bit more challenging to get the exposure right since you don't have a preview in the viewfinder as you are shooting but I feel it will just make me a stronger photographer for it.Overall I am thoroughly impressed with this camera.  There are many other things I enjoy but feel they are mainly personal taste such as size and weight.  There was no other Nikon model that interested me enough to make a switch before this one.  It fits me perfectly.  Chose it over the 5DM3 which I was poised to get.  Size weight and feel were a big part in that decision.It can be tough to decide where to put your money.  Best advice is to make sure you know what is most important to you and don't settle on those.  If you are not sure buy a low end camera from the manufacturer that appeals most to you and move up when you have a solid understanding of what you need for daily shooting.
