I wanted this to be my magic bullet my do all one camera system.  Images were spectacular zoom range was incredible albeit slow electronic zoom to get from wide to tele.  The 4K video was sharp and smooth best I have ever used the slow motion capabilities were mind blowing although I was not a skilled user it could prove a great tool.My only complaint was AF speed and shutter response it is painfully slow compared to my Micro four thirds system I was hoping to replace.  And even slower compared to a DSLR from the the past few years.  If you are coming from a bridge camera or a smaller point and shoot this may be an improvement for you but this will not replace a MILC or DSLR for any moving subjects or active wildlife uses.
