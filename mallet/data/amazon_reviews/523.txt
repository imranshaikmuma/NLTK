Pros:-Super portable.  It's the size of a pack of cigarettes.-Better photos than expected even in super zoom-Many features of Sony's more expensive cameras-Good battery lifeCons:-Fragile-So small controls are cramped-Not well sealed against dust-Extensive menus can be troublesome-Viewfinder is difficult to use and finickyWe used this camera on a 3 week vacation and took about 4000 photos with it.  It worked well but does have a few issues.The camera takes great JPG photos and has menus and photo effects similar to Sony's DSLR lineup.  Super zoom is reasonably clear and auto features are accurate.  With some Lightroom editing the pictures are far beyond what a smartphone can achieve and honestly better than I had expected to generate.  Slipping it into a pants pocket while on hikes and other activities was a huge bonus.  It was about 2/3 the size I had expected!  The battery life was ample and lasted through over 400 photos using only the LCD screen.  That being said the "pocket camera" title is exactly what caused the most headache.  The lens now has 4 large dust particles on the inside which can be seen in some photos.  I think this is from poor sealing and of course being in my pocket for days on end.Also the lcd screen is showing some wear from the same treatment.The biggest upset happened when I managed to turn the camera on while still in my pocket.  The lens extended bound inside my pocket and stripped a few teeth from a gear.  It still works but is noisy during zoom and off/on.  I will have to send it in for service.The viewfinder is difficult to use thankfully the LCD is bright enough for direct sun.  Also I have some skepticism about the long term durability of this camera.  It's almost too tiny for it own good.  If you plan on pocketing this camera you may want to get a clean cloth bag or neoprene sleeve for it to avoid dust invasion.
