I am 5'9 and 138lbs. Scrubs always seem to run large so I ordered a XXS TALL. They fit like a glove. Not a whole lot of room left but that's how I like them and they are long and drag on the ground a little but hat how I like it because being taller I have issues with having scrubs being  short. A XXS regular would probably be too short (because the smaller the size that is ordered the shorter the inseam) I have ordered a S TALL before in this brand and they were super huge on me especially in the butt and thigh area that's why I went with the XXS instead of XS.  They are not a stretchy material but not stiff either. These are the best fitting scrubs I have and I have ordered more than 1 pair because it is hard to find TALLS.
