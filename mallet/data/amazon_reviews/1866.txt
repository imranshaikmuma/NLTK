I spent quite a lot of time researching my next laptop and when I finally settled on this one I was surprised to see that it had an empty RAM slot and hard drive slot. So I purchased the i5 6300HQ version with the extra 8GB RAM. When the laptop arrived the RAM was in the same box and I quickly got to work un-packaging and installing. When I removed the back panel I was happy to find the most descriptive and easily accessible internals I have ever seen. Down to "Remove the battery cable before touching components". I installed the new RAM without any issues and then installed the Samsung 850 Evo SSD I purchased. The SSD fit perfectly into the HD slot without any movement.I have attached two pictures of CrystalDiskMark tests one shows the stock M.2 drive and the other shows the 850 Evo - 500GB. The stock SSD did very well compared to the Evo in the Read tests but fell behind a little in the Write tests. This is understandable considering the Evo is one of the top SATA SSDs on the market and probably the best value. Regardless the stock SSD outperforms most SATA SSDs you will find especially pre-installed.This laptop boots in about 8 seconds. The loading screens flash briefly I'm impressed.*One caveat: When you first start up you will need to change the default graphics setting to the NVidia card if you plan on gaming or video editing. The default setting is 'Auto' which basically means Integrated Intel graphics. Once you change that you're good to go.
