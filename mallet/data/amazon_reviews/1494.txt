I like Cherokee scrubs. I like the material style and waist (elastic in back drawstring in front.) However I ordered a Size Medium and I was swimming in them. I am 5' 2" tall 162 pounds 32" waist 37" at belly button size 39" hips. They were also 6 inches too long. I will be ordering a size small petite.Everything else about the order was perfect and shipping and returning was very easy.  The pants aren't too "flare" legged and aren't pin straight either.
