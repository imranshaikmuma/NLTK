This is my 3rd BLU phone. The first 2 were the Studio Energy 2 and those phones were very sturdy as well as dependable. This phone not so much. This phone has issues and I will not go into all of them but I will say the main two that made me return mine. First off when making a call the phone would just reset back to DOS mode or Android mode. It would say Android needs a password to reboot. Five minutes later I would be able to dial the number. The second issue that tops my list the speaker was horrible. It would be louder for music but scratchy and then too low for the ringer and notifications. I see more people are having the speaker issue as well so back it goes. NO the plastic was not left on it. This is how they are trying to explain away the issue on other phones they sell as well. This way the potential buyer thinks Oh buyer mistake. This is not the case on most.Also no thanks to amazon for holding back my shipment. Took over a week for 2 day shipping. Zero stars to Amazon for that.
