This is the my 3rd pair of WonderWink 4 way stretch scrubs. I purchased the first two pair in black and navy at a store where I tried them on first and loved the fit and fabric. My originals wash up wonderfully and have worn very well.  I was so excited to get them in a new color (pewter)!  Imagine my disappointment to find that the exact same size now fits a full size smaller. The fabric feels thinner cheap and does not look as good coming out of the wash compared to the ones I already have! I don't know if they changed the fit and fabric in the past year or if these are a cheap knock-off but I will not be ordering them online again!
