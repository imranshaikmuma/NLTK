I've had every budget smartphone out every BLU MOTO Sony experia nexus 5 nexus 6 and this is by far my favorite some people don't like the stock UI but i think its something new and interesting downloading Google Now is a must stock launcher does not have an app drawer . The finger print scanner works seamlessly into the design and functionality It took me a day to remember to set my finger on the back and it takes .0000005 seconds to read the print to unlock the phone. The screen is super bright and crisp the only downside is the black border around the display but its hardly noticeable. The Honor 5X is hands down the best budget phone on the market it hasn't lagged out on me once and i haven't had an app crash yet. Metal body is smooth and could pass for a HTC A9 I still don't know how this phone is only $199.00 Usually big companies cut corners on budget smart phones as i have found out first hand. the Moto G looks like your playing minecraft with the screen resolution the nexus 5 was all plastic every BLU phone has a crappy screen software oh and the most important thing BLU phones come with S*** hardware. I haven't found one corner Huawei Has cut GOOD JOB CHINESE FELLOW who designed this one keep em coming.Thanks from Alaska Im Paul and please remember [...]
