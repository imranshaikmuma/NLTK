I'm not the kind to review much but it was the most expensive thing I have bought on Amazon and wanted to put a review. I had my phone stolen and I couldn't get it replaced by the insurance company so I decided to go on Amazon and try buying an iPhone. I was a little sketchy about it but I really wanted it so I decided to do it. My phone came in on time the phone looks brand new and the screen was perfect! Don't be nervous or have any doubts I'm really happy with what I got. It's totally worth it. It looks so new that's it hard to believe someone before me owned it. It doesn't bring a SIM card but if you already have one then your set. Don't think twice just do it trust me!! Thanks guys!!
