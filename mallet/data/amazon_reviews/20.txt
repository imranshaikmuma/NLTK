After using a Sony NEX c3 for awhile I wanted to get something newer and better. The Nikon had a learning curve but the quality of photo it produces is worth it. Pulling photos off the camera was a struggle as Nikon has a dedicated FINE format but shooting in JPEG solves that. All in all I'm happy with the camera for the price.
