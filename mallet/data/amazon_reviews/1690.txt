I ordered these shoes for a girls trip to Chicago. I wanted some cute sneakers that would be both cute and comfortable. They are a perfect light grey and they are extremely light ! The shoe itself is made of a knitted almost cotton mesh material which naturally makes them more stretchy and roomy; you can probably size down and still achieve a comfortable fit. I got them on my usual 9.5 and I use them to workout and run with no problems.
