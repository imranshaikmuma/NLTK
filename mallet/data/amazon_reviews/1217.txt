The fabric is not a jersey knit type fabric as it appears in the picture. It is more of a slinnky clingy fabric. It does have a silky feel to it which is not how it appears in the picture. Also I think if you are larger than a B cup the seams of this dress fall in the front in a way that is not flattering. I was definitely disappointed when I pulled this out of the package and it didn't look like the dress in the picture.. The sleeves also were pretty baggy. I am 4'10" and this cute dress goes to the bottom of my knee which is the only feature (other than those awesome pockets) that I do like. All in all it could be a great product for someone else just doesn't look good on me! I am returning it.
