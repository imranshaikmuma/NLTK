Start out by saying I love my BLU phones that I have had.  They were the more expensive ones I liked the first one so much I replaced it with another one.  But this one bought for a back up phone while my husband was in the hospital  I never could get to work.  We took it to the AT&T store for a SIM card and activation with a new number and they tried and tried even calling their support team and it never would turn on/call/accept calls.  And yes it was charged.  Unfortunately due to my husband having surgery and then me having an accidental injury myself I missed the three week s\window for returning the phone.  Lesson learned.  So now I have a phone that doesn't work.  Don't waste your money.  Just go get a GO phone you will be much happier with it.
