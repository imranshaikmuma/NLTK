The phone arrived in ALMOST perfect condition. I was satisfied that it looked and functioned like new EXCEPT for one major thing. The battery only charges to 60%. I've been charging this phone overnight and that is the maximum capacity of charging. The battery is is defective which sucks because what's the point of having a phone that lasts only a couple hours?UPDATE: The phone does to 100% but charging time is much slower than expected. Especially having a lag-time of 6 hours overnight. Also during the beginning of charge the phone discharged more than it charged. Hopefully this is just a battery issue and not the phone itself. I'm still confused on how this happened but it looks like it is charging fine now.In terms of the phone itself some issues to look for:Camera: It does not automatically let you use panorama mode. Only a few options were available and you have to "reset settings" in the camera function to access that and other modes as well. I always have to reset it if I want to use those modes.Memory: The device has only 8 GB so definitely make sure you have an extra micro SD. I've only installed 3 apps--NPR Skype and Line--and it says that I've already used 2/3 of full storage.The product also says that there is a 24 month warranty but after thoroughly reading the manual it does not seem applicable to the USA.
