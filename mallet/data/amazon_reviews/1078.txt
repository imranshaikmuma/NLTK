I am 5'8" and ~200lbs and these leggings are AMAZING. They are not see-through at all they go all the way to my ankle with a tiny bit of bunching they sit comfortably up above my hips and they are SO SOFT. I feel like I'm wearing LuLa without having paid $30+ a pair. Ordering more of these right now.
