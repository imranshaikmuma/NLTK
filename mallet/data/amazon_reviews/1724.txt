Gonna only give 3 stars due to that fact that if you dont like it you gonna pay out the wa-zoo to return or replace (15% restocking fee)and was sold buy "GO COMMANDO GEAR" vendor.  Disadvantage of 3rd party seller.Mine was a little small.  They have an "athletic  taper cut".  So it you are a fatty or use to the Walmart sizing of clothing.... think again! If in doubt order next bigger size.  Digital commo pattern is awesome.
