The stitching and sizing seem inconsistent-- the first two pairs i bought loved and wore out until they got thin (i'm definitely ah fuller on the bottom) and i did think they ran a little larger but that just made them more comfy. when i ordered another two pairs they were tighter around the waistband and thighs and even granted that i gained a little weight i don't think it should have made such a huge difference that one pair fit great the last day i wore them and the next day the new pairs were cutting into my waist. further the stitching on one of the new ones was uneven and the little slit at the bottom of one leg was up front with my shoelaces and not on the side. i guess next time i'll order a size up if they changed the sizing but i'm a little more skeptical of these now than prior.
