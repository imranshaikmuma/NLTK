I bought this to replace my old stretched out but trusty Carhartt Hat but what I got from this seller (Hipster Hippie (7-15days) was a cheap knock-off. I've included a picture of actual Carhartt gear vs what was delivered. It's tiny light gray instead of dark and feels "off" as in tighter on the front-left side of my head than the rest. The logo is clearly the wrong color and size. Great brand- if you get the real thing.
