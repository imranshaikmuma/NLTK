I have been wearing this style of Dickie work pant for 6 years. I have always bought them from the "W" store because they had them in stock and the convienant factor. Well......that "W" store quit selling my pants so Amazon saved the day once again. I ordered 5 pairs of 36x32 loose fit double knee dark navy pants. 4 pants were made in Mexico and 1 pant was made in Honduras. The 1 pant from Honduras was a tad tighter in the waistline but it still fits (time to loose some weight).I did notice some GOOD differences from the Amazon Dickie pants versus the "W" store Dickie pants.Amazon Dickies:-metal clasp front closure-deeper front pockets-button up LEFT back pocket-WAY thicker belt loops 1 1/8" thick X 2" long (7 of them)-better made zipper-material is thicker"W" Dickies:-button up front closure-shallow front pockets-No buttons on back pockets-very thin belt loops 1/2" X 2 1/8" long (7 of them)-cheap zipper-thinner materialWe will see how these last but so far I am very satisfied with Amazons Dickie work pants. I provided pictures of the two side by side. The darker pair are from Amazon and the lighter (worn) pair are from "W" store.CPS
