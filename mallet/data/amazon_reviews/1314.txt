Im so upset! I had high hopes for this waist trainer. I've been using it for about 5 days and 2 of the back support columns already broke. I have been using frequently and have noticed results already but I assumed it would have been built with better material. I'm 5'4 and 132 lbs. I'm already looking for a new one! Ugh!
