This is probably one of the best cameras in it's class.  It works great for the beginner and is capable of growing with you as you gain confidence with photography and with the camera itself.  When this first arrived I was overwhelmed by all of the buttons.  I never thought I would learn them.  After reviewing the included literature once I feel reasonably confident on playing with some manual settings.  It takes phenomenal pictures in auto "point-and-shoot" mode and has several auto/manual modes that seemed to be designed to take you from "what is a DSLR?" to "I think a lower F-stop would really bring out her eyes."  The pictures in fully automated mode are vivid crisp and well-exposed for just about any subject in nearly any lighting condition.  My cellphone camera takes pictures that make me look like a manic gorilla but this camera makes me look like a professional.
