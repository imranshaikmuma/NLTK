I bought two of these new 5X' for my mother and father.  I wanted them to have updated phones with decent specs and im glad I made this move.PROS: Price - $200Screen - 1080P LCD Goodness that is very vibrant and bright.Materials - A nice metal build that looks premium and feels good in the hand not as good as HTC?Camera - very good performer for $200  perfect for social media.Speaker - pretty loud for ringtones and mediocre for listening to music.Battery - 3000 mAh  enough for a day of normal use!Finger print scanner works very fluidCons - The phones would lag if I started to do heavy multitasking which included the opening of more than 4+ apps  and trying to move through the phone really fast.  This is quite normal since we are dealing with a mid range CPU and 2GB ram.Overall the speed is quite sufficient if you aren't speeding through the phone.Misc - Some people may not enjoy the EMUI interface but I found it very nice!  it was a breath of fresh air to experience versus the other major players' skins in the Android market
