These pants fit like a dream as well as being stretchy! What more can you ask for. Being 5'9" and 220 or so lbs I usually wear L-XL (depending on the brand) in scrub pants. Having not ordered from their Core Stretch line before I ordered my normal Large size. They fit perfectly and honestly I could almost go for a medium. The pockets are placed very well and the cargo pocket holds my iPhone 6+ (with large-ish case) perfectly. I was actually looking everywhere for my phone at work because I forgot it was in there...oops.These pants priced at $21.99 at the time of purchase are a bit more than the regular WorkWear line which are usually $14.99-$17.99 per pair but I think they are well worth it. The stretch is a nice touch and keeps the wrinkles and rips at bay! They wash very well and as far as I can tell have not shrunk or faded yet from the dryer.
