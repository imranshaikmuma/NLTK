I love this lab coat! The material is thick and keeps me warm when I'm in a cold lab building all day.  I was able to get a friend of mine to embroider my name on the coat so it makes me look very professional. I also love that the coat has a ton of pockets and the fabric has already protected me from some wayward acid drops. If you want a jacket that is well made and will keep you safe in the lab this is a good choice and also the price is more than fair. In my case the jacket does fit on the large side if you are a woman. I bought a small and it's still very baggy on me (5'7" 143lbs). If they offered an extra small I probably would have bought that but the small isn't so large that it is overly cumbersome and unsafe.
