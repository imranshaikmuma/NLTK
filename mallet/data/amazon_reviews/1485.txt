I love these. Very comfortable form flattering plenty of pockets. The fabric is thin but it's thick enough not to be see through keeps cool while runing around a hot unit and isn't so cheap that it feels rough or uncomfortable. The fabric might be a drawback for someone else but it doesn't bother me. The scrubs are well sewn tough enough to handle 12 hr shifts and a really good price. I would highly reccomend them.
