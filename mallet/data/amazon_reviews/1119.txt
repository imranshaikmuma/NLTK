Typically I prefer to wear KJC Faja waist trainers (absolutely amazing results but a much more intense product) but I was looking for an everyday waist trainer that I can wear at work. My work is highly active where I am typically on my feet almost the entire day bending squatting as well as carrying pushing and manuevering upwards of 80 pounds of equipment regularly.  With this activity in mind I sought this product out as a solution to a light waist support product while at work especially at a $10 price. As a waist trainer it is okay it provides light support and allows all day activity. It is also breathable which is a giant bonus in my book! It does have some cons; the boning that helps the product retain its shape is very flexible and at times will poke uncomfortably I also think it will not remain intact with regular use and may begin to stick out or otherwise lose its shape and purpose; the material although breathable may lose its shape as it is very stretchy. Overall if you are looking for a cheap and light support waist trainer this is it and if you are new to waist training this is a good starter product....but if you are looking for a more supportive figure shaping product that will last I suggest looking into other options such as KJC shape-wear.
