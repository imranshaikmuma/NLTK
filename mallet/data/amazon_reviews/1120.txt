It really makes me look slimmer under my clothes. It slims my stomach a bit but I notice the biggest difference in my sides. They look smaller and smoother. It's not magical so it doesn't give me the perfect body but it makes me feel more comfortable wearing tighter clothes.It's easy to put on and VERY breathable. Which means I don't get all gross and sweaty when I have it on for hours at a time.It's kind of a pain if I'm sitting for long periods of time because the hard plastic digs into my hips but besides that I love it. I've already recommended it to many friends.
