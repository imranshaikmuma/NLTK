Pros:- SSD. It's faster than your regular notebook with HDD.- Latest generation of Intel's entry-level processor.- Windows 10 is a perfect fit.- Really big screen.- Really light.- Hibernate and wake up in a matter of seconds.Cons:- SSD option is pretty small. The default system takes up 20GB alone.- Comes with Dell Intel McAfee and Microsoft bloatware (which you can safely remove).- Feels cheap (well it is). The construction doesn't feel solid. The keyboard and touchpad feel plasticky.- Power connector is so thin feels like it could break.
