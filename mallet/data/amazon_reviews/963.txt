No stars. I put the battery in and had it working well. I had to download an app to get it to work and after I found the right app I was impressed with the quality I got for the 28 bucks or whatever it costs. I went to put a memory card in and replaced the battery. Nothing. Dead. Over. I took out the memory card and replaced the battery. Nothing still. Took a look and realized the pins for the battery had sheared off. If the seller wants to leave a good impression they will send me another.
