I purchased one of these cameras for a gift.  She enjoyed it so much I bought another for myself.  I am someone who is lacking camera expertise but this is fairly easy.  Lots of things to do if you test out everything in the manual available by downloading.  Fun and creative and can let you see inside a heron's nest 150 up in a fir tree.
