I bought the grey one in large. I'm a size 10 and a large chest and it fit perfectly. I ordered the heather grey but when it arrives it was much lighter than expected. The fabric is clingy and unforgiving if you have curves or bumps you don't like pointed out I recommend a darker shirt. I thought this one was darker so that is why I bought it.
