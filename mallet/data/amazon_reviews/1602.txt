I bought a pair from a scrub store and they fit me PERFECTLY! So I decided to buy them from amazon because they were cheaper. I ordered 2 pair. They arrived on time and but when I put on the stone  colored pair they were huge (about 2-3 inches too large in the waist and about 4-5 inches long in the legs). I thought maybe I ordered the wrong size to I rechecked but nope it was the same size as the one I bought at the scrub store. Then I tried on the navy colored pair and they fit just perfectly. So upon further investigation even though I ordered 2 of the same (just different color) I was sent a pair with an "x" at the end of the style number. But since I took the tags off and washed them (before I tried them on) I can't return them...
