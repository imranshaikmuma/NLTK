I have always been a fan of budget phones. With each new iteration they get better and more affordable. The Honor 5X is no exception. I have the Nexus 6P Galaxy S6 Edge + and the Moto X Pure Edition (2015). Although it is not as powerful as these phones it is still a great phone for the price. The fingerprint sensor works perfect. I love being able to us the sensor to go back to my home page take pics and check notifications. The phone is fast but it does lag a little bit. However that should be expected. It doesn't have a high end processor. However the minor hiccups can easily be overlooked by the sheer beauty and overall performance. Get this phone and you will not regret it!
