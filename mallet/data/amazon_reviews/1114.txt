I was a little skeptical about ordering this waist trainer since the price was much lower than what I am use to seeing. I received this product a little over a week ago and I am very satisfied with it. As far as waist trainers go it is very comfortable and I can breath in it without discomfort. I wear it several hours a day and when I work out and I am already seeing results. I ordered it based off of my waist measurements and it is very true to size. I recommend this product to anyone who is trying to flatten their stomach.
