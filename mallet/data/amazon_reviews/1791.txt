In the program I'm in we are only allowed to wear Cherokee Work Wear or Work Wear Core Stretch. The clinics I'm in are freezing and it's frustrating having to wear a long sleeve shirt in 90 degree weather because the building will be cold. I wanted a scrub jacket that was warm but also easy to move around in. Buttons/snaps are clumsy and not easy to do when you are in a hurry so when I saw Cherokee made a jacket that had a zipper I was sold. I ordered this jacket in the same size I wear my Core Stretch tops and it fits greats. It is super comfy lightweight easy to move around in and warm. My hands are always freezing so I constantly have my hands in the pockets. When zipped it fits snug (which is good when you are cold) but my hands can't be comfortably placed in the pockets. Easy solution: when hands are cold jacket is unzipped. When my body is cold and I need to use my hands jacket is zipped. The cuffs do pill a little bit but it doesn't bother me. I'm 5'10 ordered a medium and the sleeves are the perfect length for my long arms. I even have enough material to stretch the sleeves over my hands. I would definitely recommend this jacket!
