A very happy camper I am! I upgraded to the 80d from a 60d and am very satisfied with the new 80d. The additional functionality the 80 brings is amazing compared to the 60 and by the way I was very satisfied with the 60. The 45 focus points and the 7fps is what made the decision easy. I have been using the camera for about 3 weeks and am loving it the fast focus the tack sharp shots and the additional focus points are awesome. The internal wifi is great as well with the addition of the android app for viewing and use as a remote are great new features from the 60. I would highly recommend this upgrade if you are using a 60d or earlier canon!
