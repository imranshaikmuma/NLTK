Just a quick note to caution buyers that there is a fair chance that the lettering on the mode dial on the top of the camera will wear off. The mode dial lets you switch to such settings as automatic program aperture priority shutter priority scene panorama etc.  I bought my ZS50 in May and by a month later the lettering had faded and disappeared during my normal daily use. The Panasonic support people were little help. They acknowledged that the problem is a "known issue" to Panasonic. But all he did was say I should send it to their McAllenTexas repair center. I was given no info on whether the problem was correctable how long I would have to do without my camera or any assurance that the same problem wouldn't recur even if they "fixed" it or gave me a new camera. If you get a ZS50 with this problem you can determine what mode you are in by looking at the monitor screen but you will no longer just be able to look at the mode dial to see what setting you are in. By the way it's a good camera.
