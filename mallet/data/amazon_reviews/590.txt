Nice looking camera but some drawbacks.Primary one is I couldn't use my old SD card from my broken Panasonic and the "duo" cards this one uses would cost half as much as the camera for the same GB!I liked the intuitive controls but the icons on the camera dial were so tiny they would be hard to work with. Also the type size in the booklet that comes with it is painfully tiny. (Do they really have something against people with bifocals?) Also disappointing that the booklet doesn't spell out how to transfer photos to your computer. (Tried it by the seat of my paints and it ended up similar to most cameras using their funky cable--which has a release button on the bottom of the plug that goes into the camera. That they should have told us about!) Also was disappointed that I had to take battery out of camera every time I changed it--and one review said that would mean resetting the time and date every time.The two photos I took looked quite nice but not enough to make me want to keep it.
