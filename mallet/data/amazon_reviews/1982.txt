I've had this laptop for a few months now. It works great. Battery power works well. A little slower response time than my desktop. The keyboard keys are a little more spaced out than the standard; I have to check to see that I'm hitting the return and shift keys correctly. The cursor button is not very responsive; I need to press it pretty hard to make it work so have resorted to using a wireless mouse exclusively.
