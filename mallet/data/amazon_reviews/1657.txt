Love the sneakers they are wide comfortable the soles are thick and really cushioned for impact when walking. I wear a size 8.5 wide I should have ordered a size 8 they were a little too long but other wise very fitting and really nice looking. The only problem is you really can't RUN with these sneakers. They are made for walking purposes in my opinion and experience. When I tried to run on the treadmill the soles are really "clunky" thick and I end up stumbling every now and then because the rubber catches against the treadmill or when I try jogging outside I stumble on the sidewalk or concrete surfaces not really used to such a difference in step with the thick soles.Don't let that deter you from the sneakers though if you like to walk or stand a lot these are really comfortable and take a lot of stress off my back and knees.
