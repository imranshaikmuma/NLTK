The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a fantastic phone but the one I received from this seller was defective. I didn't find out until after it was activated so this presents a big problem for me. The problem is that the it won't charge the battery. The first time it charged the battery to 40% and that is when I had to take it to the AT&T store to get it activated. When I returned home I put it back on charge and let it charge for a couple of hours before I returned to get it. The phone was not charging and it was 1% changed. I reset the phone and it charged again when it got to 30% I installed the update. I thought the update might fix the charging problem. After the update the phone was reset while it finished installing that all went fine. I saw that the phone was charging so I left it on the charger and went o sleep. When I returned 7 hours later it had stopped charging and the phone was charged to 19%.  So all the problems with the phone have to do with the charging. I also tried the finger print scanner as a method to unlock the phone but after it was trained it took way to many tries to get it to read my finger correctly. It was a good thing that the phone had a backup password that could bypass the finger print. I don't know if I should order another one of these phones I am pretty sure they are refurbished phones but they avoid saying that in the description.
