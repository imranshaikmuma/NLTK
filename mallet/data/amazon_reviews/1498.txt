The leggings are fine as far as quality and length. However the waist is very roomy unlike the size 7/8 in other brands. I had to take them in on the sides as returning was a lesser option. (She needed an extra change of leggings while visiting and none others were available.) The waist was so big that it was as if the sizing was off. I was unfamiliar with "French Toast" so was caught off guard. Maybe a child with a thicker waist would do okay with this brand.
