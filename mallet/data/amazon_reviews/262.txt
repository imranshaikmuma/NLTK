I was a bit worried about ordering this camera given that it's about $200 less than Amazon is selling the same camera for. It came in brand new in the box with all of the accessories (strap cords instructions etc). It is exactly the same as the one being sold for 1100 on here so if all you need is the body and you're trying to decide between the two go with this one!
