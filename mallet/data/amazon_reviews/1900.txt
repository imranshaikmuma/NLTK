If you are someone who doesn't require a lot of storage space this is a great entry level laptop for you. The performance boost from an SSD (even a low end SSD) will far outweigh many other upgrades including additional RAM. This system is a perfect combination of processor + RAM + SSD for the price. When you purchase be sure to check for updates in Settings -> Update and Security for the latest Windows 1511 build that was released. The update will take some time to install but when installed it will improve speed by about 30% for startup and regular usage.Pros:System has a good low end quad-core processor.SSD is great for speed.15.6" display looks goodSystem is relatively light given its size.Windows 10HDMI outCons:Limited storage space (not meant for those looking to store large amounts of pictures/videos/music)No DVD optical driveCharging cable has very thin connector to system can be broken fairly easily.Feels cheap though not as bad as you would think at this price point.Bottom Line:If you're looking for a low end system with no frills just to get basic day to day computing done or for school work this is a great system for you. Get an external hard drive to store your pictures and videos and you'll be all set!
