My night started out with pure enthusiasm as I found out my iPhone arrived. Soon that enthusiasm would go away.The first problem with the phone started out small but rather annoying the mute button was defective. I would mearly breath on the phone if even that and it would start toggling between mute and sound all while buzzing. Annoying.Then I found out that the model of iPhone was originally from either Korea or Japan making it so that I could not turn off the shutter sound when taking photos/snapshots highly annoying.I looked through the packaging to find out there was a 90 day warranty and I just had to call/email to get ahold of the company to fix the issue. Simple and helpful right? It would be if the company actually picked up the call or emailed you back. What a joke.I found out there are a couple work around a to these issues and I wasn't happy doing them but I didn't want to be without a phone even for a couple days (why I paid for this one to be over nighted to my dorm room even though it ended up not able to be in my hands until two days after I was supposed to.) so I was going to keep it.Then it died at 40 some percent battery and now I'm going to just return it and never deal with magic mobile partners again. Ever. I would advise you and anyone else who asked me to do the same. Just when I thought I was going to actually like iPhones probably will just buy a new one as I would suggest you do too if you want one.
