For the price I was VERY happy!!! They are cute and you stay dry and warm! You can wear them with or without a sock I wore them with thin sock and it was perfect!  The lining is warm keeps snow out! I wore them in Big bear recently with tons of snow on the ground and they didn't disappoint! BUY THEM You won't be disappointed
