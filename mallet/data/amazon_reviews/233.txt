Hey whats up everyone my names Chris Winter and today I’ve going to do an indepth Review of the brand new Nikon D5600 to see if it’s a good camera for you. Let’s review the brand new Nikon D5600.Build QualityLet’s first get started by taking a look at the build quality and features of the new Nikon D5600. When you first pick up the Nikon D5600 I’ve got to say that it really does feel nice. The Nikon D5600 is targeted towards either beginners or photographers who want to step up from a begginer camera and I think it fits the purpose. It’s not a huge camera but compared to something like this camera here the new Nikon D3400 there is a noticable step up in size. Button placement is good too. Nothing too different from other Nikon bodies so if you’re used to the Nikon system you’ll feel right at home. So overall the Nikon D5600 feels great it’s not too heavy and its not too light its right in that sweet spot for a DSLR.LCD ScreenLet’s now turn the Nikon D5600 around and take a look at the LCD. And this is where things get exciting. The Nikon D5600 is one of a small number of DSLR’s from Nikon to have an articulating screen. And it’s a good one at that. Compared to some cameras from some other brands the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is the real deal and can even be flipped to face you in the front. Now that might seem like an insignificant feature but for people who film themselves like I do that’s a huge deal and will mean this will be a great camera for youtubers. Not only that it really does allow to get shots from up high or down low which is normally a dificult thign to do if youre just relying on the viewfinder. The screen itself is also really quite good. I was very impressed with the screen from teh baby brother the Nikon D3400 and the Nikon D5600 is equally as good. One thing that I really loved about the Nikon D5600 is it’s touch screen. I really don’t know why more DSLR’s don’t include these as they make it them much easier to use. So overall the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is definitely impressive and one of the highlights of the camera.MenusSo I quickly wanted to touch on the menus on the Nikon D5600. Overall they were quite good with a lot of information and settings at your finger tips. Now if you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR you’ll feel right at home in the menus on the Nikon D5600 but if you’re coming from a Canon background it might take a while to get used to. So again the menus are pretty good. They’re fast to get around and if you’re used to Nikon you’ll feel right at home here.CompetitorsNow if you’re thinking about purchasing the Nikon D5600 theres a good chance you’ll have looked at some of it’s competitors. Firstly on the cheaper end the recently released Nikon D3400 is another option to look at. It’s cheaper than the Nikon D5600 but importnatly is missing the articulating screen and the touch screen. The Nikon D5500 is the Nikon D5600’s predecesccor and is actually pretty similar. One thing it is missing htough is snapbridge which could be something you’re interested in. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse feature which is missing on the Nikon D5500 which is somehting we’ll talk about later. On the higher end we’ve got the Nikon D7200. It’s a little bigger and has great autofocus but doesn’t have an articulating screen and is also more expensive. On the Canon side the Nikon D5600’s big competitiors are the Canon T6i and Canon T6s and also perhaps the Canon 70d and Canon 80d. The Nikon D5600 does have continuous auotofocus in video mode but if compared to cameras like the Canon 70d or Canon 80d it’s still not at that level. It works but I wouldn’t bet my life on it. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse mode as well which is a really nice inclusion. This was included on the Canon 80d and i actually found mysefl using it quite a lot so having it on the Nikon D5600 is nice. And if you do like to shoot in slow motion the Nikon D5600 can shoot at 60frames per second so you can slow it down it post nice. So overall if you’re looking for a great DSLR for video the Nikon D5600 might not be the best but it’s good.So overall I’ve been very pleased with the Nikon D5600. Is it a huge upgrade from the Nikon D5500? Well not really but this is a great camera not only for photographers but also for those interested in vdieo as well. Good job with this one NIkon.
