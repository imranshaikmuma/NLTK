I held off on writing this because I did have to exchange for a bigger pair. I checked the size of all of my shoes and the EU size was 40 so that's what I originally ordered but they were ridiculously small. I exchanged for a 41 and they fit perfectly. The suggested fit was 41 but because all my shoes are 40 I felt more comfortable ordering that but should have went with the suggested size. I am a constant size 10 if that helps anyone with bigger feet. I went through the reviews and none really stated a size that big and how they fit. I have had to buy one pair of 9.5 shoes and one pair of 10.5 other than that always size 10. I couldn't be happier with how the exchange went either. The new pair shipped the day after I requested an exchange. I had bought these at the $35 price and the price went up to $80 after I ordered them but I wasn't charged extra. I ordered Black Marbled Patent and they look even better in person. I am having to wear them with hoses instead of socks because the top is kind of tight and my sock doesn't slip into the shoe and it will scrunch my toes up because of the sock. I am hoping that will get better but if not it's not a major concern for me. I should also say that I have a HIGH instep. When I walk in water and step on concrete the print of the side of my feet are about in inch maybe less so that could be why the top is a little more tighter on me than normal.I do feel like they change the way I walk and stand for the better and I love the added height even if it isn't a lot. Anyways I recommend them!
