I read the reviews that talked about slow response times and thought I'm not taking pictures of kids it won't be a problem. I couldn't have been more WRONG.  I can't tell you the number of photos I have missed because I had the camera in my lap picked it up to point and click and its little brain was still trying to determine what the lighting was supposed to be.  And don't think "well the lighting is off on that one I'll take another right away". Nope it is really a 5-sec delay between photos  I invested not only in this camera but and extra battery and battery charger.  After missing photo opportunities on two "one-in-a-lifetime" trips I'm cutting my losses.  Seriously it's cheap but spend the extra and get a responsive camera.  You'll be happier.
