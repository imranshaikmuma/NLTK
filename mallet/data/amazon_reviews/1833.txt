The notebook functions as advertised- Good value. I would have given it a 5 star except it is very difficult to upgrade the memory and the hard drive on this model. It has to be totally disassembled to get to those items. A daunting task even for experienced computer modders like myself. Other models have access panels for the HD and memory upgrades.
