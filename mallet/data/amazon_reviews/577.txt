I think enough people have listed the pros so let me just jump right to the cons.CONS:1. Need a steady grip to take a focused shot. Any movement will result in a blurry photo.2. Not enough clear feedback that a photo has been taken - a brighter LED lamp would suffice.3. Better LED signals on the battery life etc would be better. Having to wait for a "cool down" period before lifting it up to see the colour of the dim LED is not practical.4. Connection using wifi is troublesome - would be better if the connection were strictly bluetooth.5. Auto photo alignment would be a welcomed feature so that photos taken would not be so skewed.Overall I love this camera and take it everywhere with me. Too bad HTC doesn't seem to be planning on making a better second version.
