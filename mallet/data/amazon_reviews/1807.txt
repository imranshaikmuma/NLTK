I bought this because I loved my last Dell.  Be prepared to purchase the extended software warranty if you go with this model.  Right out of the box there were software issues (not covered under the manufacturer's warranty.)  After nearly 8 hours on the phone with Dell in the first week of ownership the product is finally running correctly.  I like it now but am not happy that I had to pay another $200 to get an extended warranty to get it working.
