The color fabric and overall look of the shirt are very good and if you're lean and athletic looking you'll probably want more.  They do seem to fit a bit snug.  I'm typically a large in these types of shirts but an XL might have been a more comfortable choice.  I'm 5'10" and about 200 and fairly lean so that might be of some relevance here.  Bottom line is that you'll be happier if you go up a size for comfort and order your regular size for a more fitted athletic appearance; either way the variety of colors and good overall quality make this shirt worth it.
