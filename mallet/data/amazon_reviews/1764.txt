I read lots of reviews on this shirt before buying it and my issue was trying to figure out which size I wanted. Looking at the size chart the L size neck measurement was too small with the chest size right and the XL had the right neck size but the chest was too large so I went with the XL and am pleased with the way it fits. I am five feet ten inches tall at 190 pounds and rather muscular so I think I could have gotten into a large but it would have been a bit too restrictive.I would say to get the size you would normally do with a T shirt. If you wear a size L T shirt get the size L Dickies shirt and so on. A couple of things I noted about this design is first some descriptions show that there is a company logo on a pocket and the bottom of the shirt but with mine there is no tag on the pocket on this one.I saw one review that said the shirt was so stiff it would stand up by itself and showed a picture of that. Okay yeah it will do that but only if you leave all of the cardboard liners inside the shirt. Otherwise I can assure you it is not that stiff and will not do that. And I read some complaining about the fabric being too rough causing a rash etc. It's a work shirt! If you have ever worn a work shirt it feels like that. The fabric doesn't feel or wear the same as a lighter gauge dress shirt. Just wash it before you wear it the first time and you should be okay. But it's always going to feel like you're wearing a work shirt.I am glad that I bought this shirt. It goes perfect with my pants from the same manufacturer. It's a good buy for the money and I plan on getting some more in different colors.
