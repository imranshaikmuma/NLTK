I am in Love with this Camera!!! I was given this Canon camera as a Christmas gift from my husband.  I have never had a SLR camera before.  My camera that I was using was a digital that I first got when digital was the new thing.  So this was quite the upgrade for me!!!  I was very intimidated at first not knowing if I would be able to use it or not. I can honestly say that if you know how to read instructions then just reading the instruction manual can really get you up and going.  Just off of reading the instruction manual I was able to learn how to make the camera basically a point and shoot camera along with also being able to figure out how to start to use some special effects with the camera still auto focusing itself.The camera also takes videos and this was very simple to figure out how to do.  It has lots of different modes and tons of options if you are camera savvy and know what you are doing to make some quality photos.  When my husband wanted to get me a camera for Christmas he did tons of research.  He is a computer guy so research is really his thing.  He found this to be the best option out there for someone who is new to learning an SLR along with being one of the most sought after cameras from those who are well experienced with SLR cameras.  So whether you are new to SLR or a pro the photos I have seem come out of this camera are amazing.  I will attach just a few of the photos this newbie took in my first week of learning this camera.It is a very pricey camera at $1200 but if you can swing the cost it is well worth it and I would highly recommend this camera!!!!!
