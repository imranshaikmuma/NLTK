Excellent!  Worked great right out of the box clear and bright picture.  Adjustable LED's on the head are easy to use software worked on the first try and the included retrieval kit was a nice surprise (I do wish something was included to help keep the camera and the little tools together or organized).  Cable is flexible but just stiff enough that it will hold some shape for 12-15 inches unsupported.  I wasn't able to find my missing car key but it definitely wasn't the camera's fault. :)
