I bought this petticoat to go with "Pistachio Women's Sun Flower Flowing Knee Length Summer Dress" which I had bought on Amazon as well as other 50s style dresses that I want to buy. I will admit I love the 50s style of big poofy dresses so I had some trouble deciding which petticoat to buy. I really wasn't sure if this one would add enough volume for my taste but it seemed to be well liked so I decided to try it. I have to admit it took a little adjusting too but I think this petticoat is just poofy enough to wear with a dress without making it look like a costume (although you could definitely wear it with a costume I plan to use it for special occasion/church dresses).I did order the large of this petticoat and I am 5'7" and weigh around 210lbs. I had debated which size to choose as I have been losing weight and wanted to get a size that I could continue wearing as I do so. I probably should have bought the XL as this was a bit snug on me but the waist is stretchy so I can still wear it. If I did need to order another one then I would definitely go up a size. Also I noticed that most people said this is not itchy which was really surprising considering that most petticoats tend to be itchy because of the fabric used. However the lining on this one is really good at protecting your skin from the itchy outer skirt. I did notice that when sitting the lining can slip up enough to make the stiffer fabric brush your legs but more than likely it would stay put better if I had purchased the correct size.I attached several pictures to give you an idea for how well the skirt actually works. The first is a picture of my dress without a petticoat the second is the dress once I added the petticoat. Hope that is a helpful reference point!Summary: I think this was an excellent price for a lovely product! Now I can buy all the cute 50s dresses that I love so much but that only look right with a good petticoat. Well worth the money.
