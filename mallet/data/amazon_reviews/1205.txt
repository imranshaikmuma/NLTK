I absolutely love everything about this set! The color is amazing and the top is super comfy. The only thing that I would note is I have little more in the hip and booty department and the panties are just a little snug. Not so much that I would return but just in case this would be a problem for anyone like me and you would rather have a looser fit. The way the top is made you could probably go up a size and still be good. I love that the top is halter. The material is soft and made really well! Definitely will be a repeat customer!
