I've bought it from Amazon and it works flawlessly with aussie's 4G.After 3 weeks working and playing around with h8I have  found its battery drained quite fast. And I have seen the causes : the EMUI and power -  intensive apps ON.Now I replaced Emui with apex launcher (old  simple but very fast) together with turned off all power-intensive apps (esp chrome). Further I replaced chrome by Dolphin 2017. Now my H8 is really battery save and run even faster smother..Strongly recommend this h8 for those who love Android cutting - edge with a very reasonable price.
