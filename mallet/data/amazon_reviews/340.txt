I love this camera!  I bought it for the long zoom and have been truly impressed.  It takes great videos even with the zoom but I had to purchase a monopod to help steady it--it can be hard to keep it on the subject when you've really zoomed in.  The colors in my pictures have been very vivid too and it does well in low light.  I am particularly impressed with how well it did taking a picture of the moon--it looked more like something you'd see through a telescope.  It doesn't do as well with action shots as my Canon but I'm still happy I bought it because of the great zoom and the price was much cheaper than any of the other cameras I looked at with comparable zoom capabilities.  I'm just a point-and-shoot kind of photographer and though it has lots of settings I will probably never figure out it's simple enough that even an amateur like me can take great photos.
