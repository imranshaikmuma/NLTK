I was required to purchase a lab coat for my college anatomy and physiology lab. For the price I paid all I got to say is that I love this lab coat! I'm a 5'8" 170 lb. male and I usually wear a medium. I also bought the lab coat in medium and it fit perfectly. The only minor issue is that the sleeves are a bit short. They sit slightly above my wrists but that's okay. Also the buttons seems a bit weak since they are double threaded but it's nothing you can't fix on your own! Overall I'm glad I chose this lab coat over all the other sellers on Amazon. And for $17 it's not bad!
