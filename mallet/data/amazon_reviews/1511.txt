Lee has always been my go-to brand for jeans and pants but Lee has gotten very sloppy in their manufacturing -  I keep getting pants and jeans with one twisted leg or one side of the jeans smaller than the other zipper that points up to my left shoulder instead of being midline and huge inconsistency in sizing.  I just ordered 2 pair of jeans in size 6 short 1 pair Olive and 1 pair in Black.  The black jeans fit as expected with plenty of room and slightly long but no need to hem.  The olive jeans were way too tight shorter in leg length than petite jeans (would be way too short if I washed them) and the entire left side of the jeans including leg and even derriere was noticeably smaller than the right side.  As others have mentioned I sure do wish I could get these jeans in true denim instead of the stretchy garbage now being used.  What the heck Lee?  Very shoddy workmanship.
