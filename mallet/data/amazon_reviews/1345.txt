Kinda bummed!  These leggings are SO comfortable and fit great.  They have a good amount of stretch and the high waist is super comfortable.  That said I've worn them twice around the house and there is already a hole in the crotch.  I'm not sure if I got a defective item or if they're all this flimsy in the seams but unfortunately the pair I have doesn't seem built to last a wash or two...
