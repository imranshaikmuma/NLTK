THe Cannon Shot 720x is an amazing camera. I have shelved my larger more sophisticated ones.  I have had the Powershot series for several years now and the amateur photos I take with it have earned me 4 awards including "grand prize" and "people's choice" in 2 years against professional photographers with much more complicated equipment.  This camera is lighter and more compact that its predecessor model with a better zoom. It also take better landscape photos.  The Image World is also first rate to deal with I did have an issue with the first camera sent and the staff of The Image World have been quick to respond and are sending a new replacement. I take wild life photos and there is often no time for set up so if you want an amazing wild life or people shot taken with a great zoom this is the camera.
