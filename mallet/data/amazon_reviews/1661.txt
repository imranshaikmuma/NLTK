I love these sneakers. I where them for work and trust me I am on my feet all day and I put a lot of miles on these shoes. They are very comfy and supportive. I get sore heals and I have found that these prevent that the best. They are also pretty slip resistant - I also work on wet floors. They hold up pretty well too considering how hard on them I am. I usually go through 2 pairs a year but keep in mind that's 50 hours a week of non stop abuse that they take. I usually spray them with a simple sneaker water proofer and my feet never get wet even stomping through the snow on my way to and from work. They are well worth the money. I know my mom also a pair that she's been wearing for years. So considering that I have bought approximately 15 pairs of these sneakers - I would say that I highly reccomend them. The only way they could get any better is if the company would throw me a free pair considering the amount that I have purchased - haha...
