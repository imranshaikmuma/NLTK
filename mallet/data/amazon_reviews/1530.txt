I am roughly 165 lbs and am 5'3. I am top heavy and disproportionate for a female. Meaning I've always had to go with a size large for tops and sometimes a medium for bottoms. Normally sized at a large when it comes to nurses uniforms to play it safe. So I will agree with what has been said about going one size smaller on these as these run larger particularly the bottoms.Perhaps because they are meant to be unisex. I found that size medium did it for me. I will have to hem the pants to size but this is not an issue. I do not expect these to last as they are not made out of tough gabardine or heavy cotton or polyester blend but they make a decent alternative pair to replace some of my outgrown pairs or those that have been worn to the nubs. For the price they are OK. I will update how they wash out and wear down.
