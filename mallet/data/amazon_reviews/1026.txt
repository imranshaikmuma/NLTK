Great phone. Although it was refurbished It came in a perfect condition. I really congratulate the seller... really good job!The phone itself is as it is written on paper... it is super fast. It opens apps in a second... of course it has 2gb of ram and that makes the safari usage real fluent...The camera is pretty good too.The texture the weight.. everything perfect (for me)And the battery life... it's amazing... If it is in 100% and you use the phone heavily it will only drain like 8%-10% in one hour... It's mind blowing.Totally happy with it!
