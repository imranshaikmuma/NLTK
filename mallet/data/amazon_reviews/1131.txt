**photo on left is Yianna corset photo on right is an $75 lace up (Orchard) corset**I've been waist training with steel bones lace up corsets and I thought this one would be great for work/gym since it's a little more discreet. I ordered the black corset with the Yianna tags.SIZING:  I am 5'9 165lbs with a 33 inch waist. So according to the chart I should have ordered a 2XL but since I want this thing to be squeezing the life out of me at all times I ordered a Large. I got it on to the last row of hooks but this thing is LONG even for someone as tall as me. It's totally doable but someone shorter may find it digging into their breasts lucky for me I have very little.MATERIAL: very impressed for that price. Inside is very soft outside feels like neoprene. I like the spacing on the hooks they're pretty spread out so you get more bang for your buck as you size down. I'm noticing minimal wrinkling which is wonderful.SLIMMING EFFECT: if you're looking for a slim mid section than I would say it's 100% effective. Wearing a dark color shirt it's undetectable light colored shirts show a long line down your center where the clasps are. Lucky mine was a little loose where it hits my upper back so there was no roll of fat sitting on top of it.WAIST TRAINING: I was hoping for more of a waist training effect. I feel the most pressure along the lower abdomen and on the hips which are fixed points and you cannot move those in. My lace up corset gives me a squeeze from the mid abdomen up to my rib cage areas that can be shaped. Maybe It could work a little over a long period of time but at least your posture will improve.
