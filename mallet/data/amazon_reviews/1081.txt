These just might be the most amazing leggings ever. They are silky and very velvety in feel and the material is on the thicker side. I normally wear a size 10 and when I first got them I thought no way am I getting these to fit. Not only did they fit but they are extremely comfortable. I love love love them so much I had to buy more in purple & charcoal. I wash them on the hand wash cycle with a color care detergent. So far they have held up nicely.
