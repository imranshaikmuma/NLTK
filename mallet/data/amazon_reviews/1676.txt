I bought 2 pair of these shorts 3+ years ago and I've put them through daily hard use. Both pairs still hold up and I'm working in a pair right now. I run a pressure washing company and these things can hold up to the harshest chemicals I've thrown at them. I've burnt and cut holes in them and the holes don't rip. The main clasp (where the button is on other shorts) got a little loose after a few years and I just squeezed it together with some pliers and it's as strong as the day I bought them. The pockets have held nails screws razor blades you name it and there's not a hole in them. I'm a welder and these things are pretty resistant to slag and sparks and dont burn through easily.I couldn't recommend these shorts highly enough  and the only reason I need more is because these are covered in paint and I look like a slob when I bid on jobs.
