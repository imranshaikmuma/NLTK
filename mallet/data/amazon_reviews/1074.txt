These leggings are just as soft as Lularoe however the black is not as saturated in color as my black Lularoe leggings. Side by side these Leggings Depot black leggings have a brownish hue that my Lularoe leggings do not. I still wear them and recommend them but beware the black isn't a deep saturated black if you are planning to wear it with something that it might matter. When not worn with other true black items it isn't noticable.The waist on these leggings is elastic as opposed to the Lularoe yoga waist leggings and it comes up higher. The elastic is fully encased and hasn't twisted or relaxed after several washes and wears.Other than the waist being higher these leggings fit exactly as Lularoe One Size leggings do (the ones that are cut correctly). I am 5'2" 160lbs carry all of my weight in my belly have a 31.5" inseam and wear an 8 in most jeans because I am lacking in the booty department. These fit me very comfortably and they would fit someone one or two sizes bigger or smaller than me as well.If you are looking for a less expensive alternative to Lularoe leggings these are the way to go.
