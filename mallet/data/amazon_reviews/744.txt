For starters there's plenty of resolution for web browsing and apps with the interface disappearing off-screen when you're reading pages giving the full screen over to the current task. Next the 326ppi pixel density is what Apple calls a Retina display. This means that when you view the screen at a normal distance you can't view individual pixels. In other words everything looks pin-sharp and more resolution wouldn't achieve anything bar making icons and text too small to read without scaling.Image quality is excellent too. Apple has used a high-quality IPS panel and it's still one of the best smartphone displays. It's evenly lit bright produces excellent whites and vibrant colours and the excellent viewing angles mean that you can see what's on screen clearly from anywhere.
