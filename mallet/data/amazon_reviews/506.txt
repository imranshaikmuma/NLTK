You get what you pay for. Cute very small waterproof cameras that take ok pictures. Purchased for my 4 and 6 year old and they are perfect for them. Looks more like an adult camera than The fisher price one but the picture quality wouldn't work for most adults. That being said it has given us tons of fun in our pool the bath and at the river and I feel we got our money's worth. I would recommend for a young photographer who is more interested in the idea of a camera than the photos. If your trying to get your child to swim and get their face in the water this is the thing that will do it!
