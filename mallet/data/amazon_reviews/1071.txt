So soft and very resilient material. Must wear a cami under the white because it is a bit see through. I have already purchased the taupe one which is in the mail. This did not come with a tag that states "lock and love". It says "Made by Johnny"??? I also just ordered another shirt that is from "Johnny" that looks basically the same as this shirt except the sides are shirred. Those came in more colors and I prefer shirred siding so I kinda wish I would have found those first before ordering. The only reason I subtracted a star is because I did not receive the "lock and love" brand as ordered which is a little confusing.
