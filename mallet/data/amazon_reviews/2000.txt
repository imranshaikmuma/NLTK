I bought this laptop for two reasons. Running CAD programs and playing games. Sadly it's failing in the one aspect that actually matters. I don't know what is wrong with the laptop specifically but it runs games just fine; however every time I attempt to run my CAD program it blue screens. I am currently trying to resolve this with ASUS customer support before the return date however in the event that the problem is not resolved absolutely then I will return this laptop before the return date.
