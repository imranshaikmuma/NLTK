These are my second pair of Dansko Pro shoes. I have severe arthritis in my right ankle and plantar fascists in my left foot. I had been hobbling around using various braces inserts and shoes recommended by my podiatrist without much relief - until I found these shoes. I now can walk normally without a limp and without pain. I plan to keep on buying these shoes!
