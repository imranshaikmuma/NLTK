Crappiest digital camera ever!  I know that it's cheap and I guess you get what you pay for.  My eight year old son did odd jobs for his grandparents until he saved enough money to buy himself a digital camera so he could document what he finds with his metal detector.  It holds FIVE whole pictures before it finally died.  I threw away the packaging so I couldn't return it.I should have spent more money to get a quality camera for a few dollars more. Lesson learned.
