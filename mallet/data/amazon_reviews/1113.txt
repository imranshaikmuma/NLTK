I ended up returning these because just like most leggings my thicker legs stretched them out too much.  I have some higher end leggings that I paid a lot of money for that don't do this I was hoping because of the good reviews I may have found a good pair for cheap.  I wear a size 14 in jeans and the XL was a little tighter than most other XL leggings that I purchase.  I'm sure these are fine for people with thinner legs than me I just don't like the stretched out look. The other thing that turned me off was the polka dots themselves they varied in size shape and color.  It almost looks as though they are painted on.
