I ordered this shirt and purple light gray and olive green (though it looks brown in the photos). I don't like short sleeves or flowy shirts so to find this one that was light for summer and hit all of my other preferences was great.  The material is not very thick but it does not feel cheap. I think it's good for warm weather. The rouching on the sides is also nice. I do think you need to wear a camisole or something else underneath since the material is not that forgiving. Although I like these I will probably exchange them for one size up as it feels a little tight. I'm a 16-18 5'7" and ordered 2XL. Sorry for the dirty mirror.
