Takes beautiful sharp pictures.  The door cover for the battery and SD card is very fragile.  The booklet that comes with the camera lacks a lot of information to questions you may have.  I don't use the Wifi feature very confusing with information in the booklet.  Overall I wanted a high pixel camera small to fit in my purse or pocket and fairly easy to use...this camera met these for me.  But I still love my small Kodak M1073 which is no longer available.
