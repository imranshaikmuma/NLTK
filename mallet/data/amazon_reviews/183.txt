Very nice.  The kit lens is as good as a kit lens gets. Got the Canon pancake 22mm 2F STM fixed lens and results are much better than the kit zoom lens.  The combination with the 22mm fixed lens is a very small pacakge with very fast and accurate AF and fair bokeh (see the attached picture.)  This is my go to lens for now.  Just got the Sigma Art 18mm-35mm 1.8F lens with 9 blade aperture and much improved bokeh and will try it out.  Be aware that 3rd party EOS M adapters have circular instead of oval opening found on Canon adapters.  So you will get a light haze when used on an APS-C sensor if you do not use a hood with 3rd party adapters...  Google it and you will see what I mean...For the size I really like this camera.  I wish there is micro AF adjustment but frankly I would not know where Canon can put it as it is already so compact.
