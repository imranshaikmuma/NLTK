I got this phone yesterday and my plan was to use it as a backup to my dying Google Nexus 4 (now about 20% unresponsive to touching) with long term plan to order one of those high end top notch phones like Apple's  iPhone Plus Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 or Lenovo's Moto Z (Force) Droid. I still have not changed my long term plan (mostly for their camera and stereo style voice) but I feel that no need to go now on those big lines to buy in a hurry. Who knows the price for those high end top notch phones may end up dropping as much as 20 - 30 % on or after black friday and now I have the tenacity to control the urge thanks to Amazon's Play.I was worried about Play's capabilities: 2GB RAM 400 series Qualqom's Snapdragon CPU (1.2 GH) 8 MP Camera 720P Display. All of these are below mediocre. But I surfed via chrome facebook etc; played subway surfer called as far away as 5000 miles none of these mediocrities are noticeable so far. True I saw my T-Mobile bars dropped to the bottom but I had the same problem with my nexus 4. The voice and camera are also noticeably better than my nexus-4.I was impressed by the FM Radio which is full-fledged radio if you use your ear buds as antenna. I have yet to try the GPS and will hopefully update. I heard Moto has the best GPS (a-GPS) but have not tried it yet over a long drive.The promised amazon adds unlike what some said may not be removable (takes time to be 100% sure) but they show only when the phone's screen is locked. When you unlock the screen the ads will stay away. But hey most of the ads are appropriate and look better than all available android (ugly) wallpapers.The only tiny regret I have is not ordering Moto G (4th Generation without the play) for an additional $50 but going over the reviews most of them reported the supposedly better one has screen vibration problem. So all in all my "tiny regret" may not be valid after all.
