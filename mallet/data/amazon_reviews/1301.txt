**UPDATED REVIEW - 02/06/2017**I was contacted by the seller after the read my review and I was given an email address to deal with them directly.  They promptly issued me a refund for my purchase (even though I didn't want one) and that was that.  All I had wanted to do was to return the product and exchange it for an item that wasn't defective.  However they took their customer service to a whole new level and just gave me my money back.  Which I instantly used to purchase another pair of short today and have them sent out.  After I receive I will update this review after using them for a week.  However I am very pleased with the customer service at this point.**ORIGINAL REVIEW**I first tried to contact the company with my issue but since there seems to be no way to do so I am leaving this review.  I have been purchasing Tesla products off Amazon for a while and I really like them.  They fit to size very well and the are a great value overall.This experience was different however.  First off the color of the product is brown or a gray with green strips but the picture makes it look like an off black color so that was strike one.  I can get over that though because I wear these under my Tesla running shorts or under my Tesla compression pants.But then I put them on.  They fit as do my other pairs but the seam on the right side was split and open. Basically I have shorts that I cant use and can find no way to return or exchange them.  I am very frustrated.
