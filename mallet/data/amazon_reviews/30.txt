Still reading the manual and getting acquainted with it. Would have liked to have had at least a minimum card to learn to shoot with but no big deal I have others. Lots of information very small book with very small print. It's going to take a while or I'm going to find a class.Referred this camera to a 20 year pro. she gave it excellent ratings/
