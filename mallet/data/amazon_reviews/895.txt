Beautiful phone great screen even though it's only 1080p. Performance and battery life have been very good. Included rapid charger works great. Sadly it doesn't rapid charge using other standards so you'll have to buy a Huawei rapid charger if you want a second or a car charger. It is well built it slipped off a counter at an airport and didn't so much as scratch.Cons:Can't remove batteryConflicting information on screen glass (Gorilla Glass 3 or 4) and MicroSD support (128GB vs 200GB)No stereo speakers (if you prefer front facing like me you may want to check out the ZTE Axon 7)
