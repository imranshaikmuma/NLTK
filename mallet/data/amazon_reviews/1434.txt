I bought a pair of these from an Army surplus store 18 years ago.  A couple weeks ago I had them on and was on my way out the door to go to work when my wife asked if I was seriously going to wear "those jeans in public."  Being a guy I had little idea what they looked like and wore them because they fit so perfectly and were so comfortable.  Sure they were a little bleach stained and frayed at the bottom but have you ever been to a clothing store lately?  Those jeans look like they've been dragged behind a truck for a couple hundred miles.  And they're NEW!I wished that they still made my favorite jeans.  Then I decided to test the power of the internet and found an exact replacement.  Only these are not bleach stained or frayed but they fit perfectly and are just as comfortable.  Hopefully I'll still be alive in 18 years so I can write another review on their replacement.
