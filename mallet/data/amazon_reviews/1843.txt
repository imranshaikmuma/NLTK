I bought this to replace my Acer Chromebook 15. I wanted something just a bit smaller and I was sold on the aluminium case. I had to wait a long month to get it after I preordered but it was well worth the wait. In response to some of the complaints I've seen online for this Chromebook; I don't really have any use for a backlit keyboard so that's a non-issue for me I never used an SD card on my old Acer so the lack of an SD card slot on this one isn't a problem (it has 2 USB 3 ports and I use flash drives anyway) I always felt the screen brightness on the 15 was a bit much I always had to turn it down 5 or 6 clicks every time I booted it up I still turn the screen down 3 or 4 clicks on the 14 so while it is not as bright as the 15 it's not as bad as you may think. But on the other hand I do notice it isn't quite as fast as my old Acer 15. That's not a deal breaker for me but keep in mind it is a noticeable difference even on light duty tasks. On the other hand it is the perfect size for me. It is much more comfortable to sit in my lap while I'm in bed watching TV and the charger is a lot smaller too so it is easier to find a sleeve or pouch you can fit the charger in. Not that you'll really need it this one has much better battery life than the 15. Over all if you want something larger than the 11" and 13" models and you think the 15" is just a bit too large this is a great compromise. I highly recommended it.
