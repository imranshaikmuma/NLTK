Best camera I've owned! I have a D7 as well and I like this EOS 60D better. I bought it used and it's still held up 3.5 years later! Many many hours of video footage and thousands of pictures have been shot with this and I imagine many more in future. Don't spend 2 - 5 thousand on newer models... this is awesome! ...remember though you have to get the right lens. The lens that this comes with is standard - basic.. nothing special but even that lens has produced great photos for me and video. Oh btw I'm a professional photographer - I know what I'm talking about. ( here's a quick update: it's been about 6.5 years and the camera is still treating me very well. I had it professionally cleaned last week and it's functioning like new)
