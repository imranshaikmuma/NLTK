I was a bit skeptical since this chromebook operates with its own OS which I didn't fully comprehend the gravity of till I tried to download or add on some laptop necessities like Microsoft Office etc. There are a lot of users that have recommended applications free of charge but for the cost graphics weight and most importantly speed... this chromebook exceeds my expectations. Well worth the cost. The battery lasts me about 12 hours unplugged. I typically run 6-8 tabs online and am constantly streaming music from YouTube since it's only downside (as many others agree) it doesn't have a sufficient/capable MP3 player/music playing ability -yet. But I'm typically optimistic. (Still worth the cost).
