This is an awesome laptop! My go-to tech guru friend helped me set it all up and he was totally impressed with the quality of this laptop. The HDMI port allows me stream Amazon Prime movies on my TV. I use this laptop primarily for work and I love the touchscreen in addition to the keyboard. I am completely and totally delighted with this laptop.
