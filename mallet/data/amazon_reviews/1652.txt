I cannot express how great these shoes are. My husband has worked in retail for almost 20 years and is on his feet all day walking kneeling squatting you name it. We usually replace his shoes about every 2 months they inevitably break down where he squats and the soles crack the inserts come out....he's just extremely hard on shoes. We've bought cheap shoes and good quality shoes they all tear up and hurt his feet. For years he came home complaining about his feet constantly. But these Crocs have been amazing. His feet do not hurt at all even when he's on them for 10-12 hours at a time. They show typical wear on the soles from walking and getting scuffed but structurally they are still just fine. He has worn them every single day for over a year now (he doesn't have another pair of shoes just these) and they are just as perfect today as they are the day we got them. He also has a problem with foot odor but these are great for that not only do they not absorb odor (like cloth canvas or leather does) he can just wash them out with soap and water if they do get dirty. We love these!!  Note: They do run wide when they arrived they were marked "Roomy Fit".
