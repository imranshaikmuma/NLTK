this was my 3rd Cybershot camera...  I loved my old H5 but I needed an upgrade... I have a Canon SLR system also but I often like a point-&-shoot for the convenience... that said... except in name; this camera is no Cybershot..!!... user features were alien from previous models; flash must be activated manually; lens won't accept filters... the lenscap won't even fit unless the camera is turned off...  I realized this model had a "Sony" lens (not Zeiss)... image quality is poor; especially w/low f-stops.  I would have kept this for the panorama feature alone... but that is useless... you can only shoot fixed-focal length; which is only good for distant landscapes; and the image quality is TERRIBLE... enlargements would be a joke.  Enough said... no more Cybershots for me... my 8-year-old model is better than this..!!
