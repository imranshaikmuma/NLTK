The shirt is exactly what I expected except in sizing. I got it so it could fit like the yeezy season 1 which is pretty big and baggy and so I went a size up. I recommend anyone else lookin to get the same effect go up two sizes because it's still a relatively small shirt. The large is pretty much a medium.
