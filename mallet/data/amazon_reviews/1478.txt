I've had this product exactly 5 weeks. I actually bought 2 sets since the price was amazing.I'm disappointed in the quality I should've known since they were so cheap. For starters the material has begun to create this fraying little balls making them look super old and unprofessional.The colors are also not true to the image what was supposed to be wine is more like a magenta or almost hot pink.The top fits loosely at the waist area giving it a frumpy look and the bottoms bubble up at the belly area because they're so loose they make you look like you have a mommy pouch.Honestly I've gotten better products at Walmart for a similar price.Two stars for price and the fact that they're comfortable to wear.
