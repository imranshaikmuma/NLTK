Carhartt usually runs big huh? usually a size upNot these pants. the only way to fit these is to order 2 sizes up from your normal waist. For example i ordered a 32&32 (My usual size in jeans) but had to exchange them for a 34&32 for them to fit comfortably. Size in length was normal waist is just tighter than expected. hassle to return but good quality pants breathable tough. Comfortable after sizing upWhat to take awaySIZE UP 2 SIZES FROM YOUR NORMAL WAIST SIZE IN JEANS (32 TO A 34)PANT LENGTHS REMAIN TRUE ORDER YOUR USUAL SIZING IN LENGTH
