Received an iPhone in like new condition cosmetically but I don't believe it was legitimately refurbished.The battery only lasts about 1/2 to 3/4 of the day on a full charge and the phone randomly shuts off with like 30% battery life remaining saying the battery is dead.The packaging and the charger are not from Apple. No earphones or instructions were included. (The charger is the only one of those items I cared about but if it makes a difference to anyone else that is what to expect.)Very disappointed.
