This is my first product review and I'm going to make this brief.  Hopefully this will help someone who is undecided between the Canon T3i and the 60D.  I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago.  I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture iso and shutter speed.  Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots.  When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days but was sorely disappointed.  To make changes with the T3i you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display.  With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu.  The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings.  Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i:  Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings also shorter battery life
