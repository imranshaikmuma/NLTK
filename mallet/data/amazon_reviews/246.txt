I bought this as a package with the Nikkor 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6 DX VR G lens from Beach Camera via Amazon. What an EXCELLENT combination. I chose the D5300 over the D7100 simply because of the articulated rear screen.I upgraded to the D5300 from my D5100 which I now use as a back up camera.  I was convinced that the 24.2 megapixels from the D5300 would produce sharper images than my D5100 with only 16.1 megapixels...and I was right.I love the sharper images I'm getting from the camera. The larger LCD articulated rear screen is a great help for my older eyes.  It has essentially the same features as my D5100 so the transition is really easy.The only thing I would have to say that might be negative are the focus points.  The D5300 has a choice between 11 or 39 focus points.  I like the fact that the focus focus points show more in focus points on the subject but I miss the red LED single point focus on the D5100. I just like the red LED's better. The 5300 has grey squares instead. I was trying to shoot the inside of a flower the other day and I kept getting 3-5 points on the petals instead of inside.  Just something I will get used to.The packaged 18-140mm lens that came with it which I wouldn't label as a "kit lens" makes this an excellent combination and good for all-around photography. I think that this lens by itself retails for approximately $500 but the package brings it down to a savings of about $150 to $200.I'd definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone.
