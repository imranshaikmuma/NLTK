I work in a dental office and wear this jacket instead of a lab coat. I love the fit and feel of this jacket. It's a sateen-like cotton that's very soft and stretchy. The style is slimmer and much better than most boxy lab coats. I have long arms and usually have a hard time finding jackets with sleeves that fit. The sleeves are the perfect length for me but may be pretty long for others. The cuffs on the sleeves make it easy to roll up. The only thing I would note is that I had a hard time ironing out the creases when it first arrived. It is 55% cotton so after washing/drying you definitely have to remove immediately to prevent it from wrinkling. I'm 5'5 125 lbs and bought an XS.
