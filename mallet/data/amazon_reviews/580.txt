Got the camera within 18hrs after ordering it.  That was nice.  I had a lot to learn to be able to get all I wanted out of it.  Played around with it for 2 weeks.  Then took it to a trip to Las Vegas Zion and Bryce National Parks.  Good movie quality.  (Zoom was slow and exposure was a little tricky - in move mode only.)  Surprised by how well soo many pictures came out.  High Rez screen better than most.  Lots of envy from everybody I showed pictures to.  Very pocketable.  Hiked with it in my cargo pockets.  In the end it had scratches and wear all over the body and on the screen.  Had to blow the grit out of the top knob.  The action on the rotating ring on the back is not what it originally was as I used it soo much backing to review pics I had just taken.  I was never silly enough to put this camera in my pocket with keys or coins.  That is just stupid.  In short I used it hard and still very pleased.  I took some incredible pictures of the milky way out in the parks and away from lights.  1.8 3200 ISO and 20 second exposure.  Amazing.  Good low light pics. Fast from off to picture taken.  Missed almost nothing.  Friends couldn't dodge me.  Fast good Auto focus.  The zoom really slows the exposure.  Wish zoom was a more like 5X or 8X.  Panorama function is a little tricky.  HDR is good.  I wish it had more knobs for adjustments.  I'm not a fan of working through menus to do stuff.  Pricy but only the very picky will be disappointed.  But for the size very hard to beat.
