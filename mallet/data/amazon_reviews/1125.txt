I was unsure about buying this because I wanted to get an official one that Kim K has! However this was affordable so I gave it a try. I must say that I love this waist trainer! I'm 5ft 135lbs so I got a medium (hope that helps!) I would recommend getting a size larger than you usually do. I've been wearing it for 5 weeks and I have seen a difference. I do exercise but I don't diet so my results are not dramatic. However I have noticed that it helps me eat less.. Only issue I have is that it can be uncomfortable to workout in or sit it. The picture is my progress for 4 weeks.
