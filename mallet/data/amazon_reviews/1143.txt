Love Love these beanies! Beanies are a major part of my outfit in the winter I run cold so I'm wearing them outside as well as in the house. I was kind of concerned if it would fit I have a small head I can wear kid hats and these beanies fit perfectly. They had just enough slouch. They are soft and warm without being wool I'm allergic and everything warm I found was wool. The colors are great. I bought a black and burgundy one. I was scared for the burgundy one because the picture is of a pink hat but the description says burgundy so I took a change on that. They are so soft and for the price I also bought the green royal and teal. I own the copper color but it was bought from a different seller and it's more of a rust color.
