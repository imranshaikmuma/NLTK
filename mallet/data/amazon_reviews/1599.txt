I'm 5'10" wear a 10/12 in pants the large fits perfectly. Lots of pockets the seams are strong/well done on the pants themselves and on the pockets. They have a little stretch (not a ton as I thought they'd have based on the four way stretch description) the rise is very pleasantly NOT low rise and the fabric is going to work very well in a house full of pets. Fur isn't gonna bury itself in these. My only issue is that they're really flared at the bottom which I didn't expect. They're not wide-legged they actually flare. It's a little 2008-looking but they're long enough that they'll puddle over my clogs or hiking shoes and it will be less obvious. I may be able to roll them though the fabric may not be hefty enough to hold up in a roll. I intend to wear them around the house around the campsite in the evening and when I'm doing yardwork so who cares right? Good buy for the price!
