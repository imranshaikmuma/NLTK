I have been reading the reviews about some of the mirrorless cameras for quite a while.  I was mildly interested but I had a great Canon 6D that took wonderful photos and video.  Then I photographed my brother in law's wedding a few weeks ago and felt the weight of my Canon 6D and 24-105mm L lens start to bother me.  I had a small kit with me and left my bag and other lenses in the car preferring to work light this time.  So much for that...When I returned home I started looking at smaller DSLRs and read a few reviews on the Fuji X-T2.  The reviews seemed like they were written by the Fujifilm marketing department.  But there were many reviews praising the X-T2 even though it had recently become available.So I took a chance and ordered the X-T2 with XF 18-55mm lens.  It did take a bit of owner's manual study to get used to the menu layout and the different controls.  But when I started taking photos and examined the sharpness and fantastic color I became a believer!  Wow! This was the best camera since my film days when I used to shoot Fujichrome Velvia film.Since this is the initial release of this model there are a few things that I expect to see changed in a firmware release.  But it works as is perfectly for me.  I love shooting it and it doesn't seem to weigh much compared to the old Canon 6D.  To me this makes vacation and street photography fun again.I also have the XF 10-14 f4 XF 35mm f2 WR and the Rokinon 12mm F2 lenses.  They are all exceedingly sharp with excellent color.
