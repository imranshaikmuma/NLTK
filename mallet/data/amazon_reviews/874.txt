It is a real fantastic phone I have got ever!I am using two SIM cards in it. So I can use two mobile phone numbers at the same time. Of course I can select one of both T-mobile or AT&T whenever I call or text (if i wish). It is so much convenient when I am abroad. I can use one with new pre-paid SIM and the other with my original SIM card.I even use an extra external micro SD card on the same SIM card tray!
