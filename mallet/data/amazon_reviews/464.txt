Excellent camera super smooth and an upgrade in every way imaginable from the previous models - and i've owned nearly 10 Canon Powershot cameras up to this point. The zoom is incredible contrast is great and every picture feels very alive. Video quality is 10/10 and everything moves at a rapid pace for the on-the-go traveler. The menu functions have been elaborated a bit just enough to give a bit more control to the user without being overbearing.Admittedly there is a bit of grainyness when shooting darker scenes and audio can sometimes be muffled at concerts and whatnot. Somehow even my $150 smartphone is better at capturing audio and shows than this thing which is a big part of my personal life.
