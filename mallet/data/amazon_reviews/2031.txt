This laptop was purchased for basic business computing not gaming.  For what the laptop is being used for it is an excellent machine.  Lightning quick silent very user friendly.  Track pad is very responsive and accurate.  PC runs very cool. Have been using it constantly for a couple hours as I write this review and case is cool to the touch everywhere.Only gripe that I have thus far is that a PC with this price tag would be nice to come with a back lit keyboard.  However I knew before I ordered that it didn't have this so it obviously wont affect the start rating I gave.Other posters have mentioned having corrupt system files upon delivery.  I ran the same scans and no issues.  So ASUS either corrected the problem or I was lucky.
