I almost bought a much more expensive chromebook but at the last minute I found this one and saw that it had everything I wanted great reviews and a great price. I love this computer!! It's sleek and portable fast and so simple. It took me maybe one minute to set it up and get online. It's perfect for what I use it for. I'm a student so I use it mainly for homework and occasionally for watching Netflix. This computer handles having several tabs open very well. I can flip between several different tabs quickly and without lag. The display is great it doesn't get hot when I use it for a long time and it adds no weight to my backpack. My favorite part is how long it stays charged. I barely ever have to charge it! Bottom line I'm so glad I got this little machine instead of a more expensive model. I definitely recommend it!
