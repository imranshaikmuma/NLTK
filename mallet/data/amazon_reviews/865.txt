Very disappointed with the product that was received (wish I could give Negative stars). The 2 Smartphones were supposed to be NEW and the speaker sound quality on both had an awful rattle that made it hard to understand anything and the sound out the ear piece had the same quality after checking the units and taking them to my carrier they determine from the SKU# that they were refurbished??? I returned them as fast as I could and would never purchase it again. Staying with IOS for the moment very frustrated and disappointed since I had to pay for returning shipping fees.
