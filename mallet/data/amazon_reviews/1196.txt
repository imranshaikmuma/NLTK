I bought the army green to pair with a blanket scarf leggings and cognac brown boots for Christmas gatherings. I hate being uncomfortable but I wanted something cute and this dress fits the bill.I weigh 138 and I'm 5'4. I normally wear a size 6 and I bought the medium. It's billowy but I wouldn't have gotten the small. I think it looks like it's supposed to be flowy and kinda big.Because the dress is super flowy I think I may even be able to wear it as an early maternity dress. I will also be buying the burgandy color. This is absolutely perfect for wearing to teach in this winter too. I can make it look professional and cute but it will be so comfy!
