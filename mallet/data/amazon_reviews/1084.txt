I am oving these petticoats. I am attaching pictures of me wearing it for scale. I am 5'9" and weigh 145 pounds and ordered the small because it aligned with my dimensions and it fits perfectly. The fabric part is long enough that you can pull it up over your boobs/chest to wear it high if necessary so I included one such image. My only complaint is that the one seam where the tufts are attached to the bottom edge of the fabric is somewhat scratchy. Otherwise it's quite comfy!
