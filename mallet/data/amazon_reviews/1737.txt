I'm 5'7" and 196 lbs and XL is a nice comfortable fit. Nice tight (not suffocating) fit around the arms and chest. Also typically these type of poly shirts accentuate your belly if you have one like mine but I found these fall nicely flat from the ab/beer belly/gut thru the waste. I'm sure they'll look even better with six pack abs. Maybe in another life. Anyway definitely runs smaller and reading the other reviews is what made me go one size bigger. I probably would have even been safe going 2 sizes larger as it feels like they shrunk a little after the first wash. I use these to run 3-5 miles 4 times a week and they do their job. Doesn't feel heavy afterwards. I'd probably buy more of these when they go back on sale. Being phroogal myself I wouldn't pay more than $12-$15 for them.
