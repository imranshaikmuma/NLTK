I purchased this camera approximately 14 months ago and it recently became inoperable.  Like some of the other customers the ON/OFF switch quit working.  The online manual said to obtain a new battery and after doing so - there is no change.  While this camera has received many positive reviews there are still issues with it.  It's too expensive to purchase taking a chance of it not working after a year.
