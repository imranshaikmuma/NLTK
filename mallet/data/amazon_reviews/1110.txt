Ok never have written a review before...but I felt the need to give the heads up to my thicker girls. I ordered an XL in 3 pairs bought the black polka dot the croquis black and white and the printed feather. I'm 5'5 and wear a size 14 (12 if I'm having a good day and depending on the brand). I bought these because the reviews seemed to favor on the positive side compared to other brands I was investigating. I started doing a boot camp and so I wanted to get some fun workout pants. Well kind of disappointed. The feather print fit more snug than the other 2 but made the booty look good. The other 2...I could see my bright green panties through them without even doing anything but standing. So that's a no go. Even when I just put my hands through the material before putting them on I could see through them. Also they feel like just cotton leggings. I was expecting more of a workout material feel. These are basically leggings with a thick waist band. So if you're expecting a higher quality material for working out be warned. They are really cute but I don't need to worry about my goodies showing when I'm just standing around. I didn't see my underwear with the feather print and I did a few squats in front of the mirror to double check. They are also on the longer side-i had them pulled up all the way and there was material bunching at the bottom so this should be a plus for taller women. I plan on keeping the feather print and returning the other 2.  Hope this helps with making your decision in purchasing :)
