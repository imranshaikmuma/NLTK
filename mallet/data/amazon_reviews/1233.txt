I ordered this Balega brand "Balega hidden comfort" sock which I own several of and like very much.  The socks I received were NOT Balega brand but rather a "Mianzufang" brand from China.  Real Balega includes: elastane throughout for a structured fit Hand-linked toe closure Reinforced heel and toe Mesh construction for ventilation Plush under sole cushioning for extra protection and a heel tab.  The socks I received had NONE OF THESE elements.  They were obviously (and labeled as - in the only English writing on the package) 100% cotton a thin weak fabric devoid of any structuring whatsoever.  DO NOT ORDER if you want a real running sock!
