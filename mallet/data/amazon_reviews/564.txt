After reading several of the reviews here I decided it would be best to test the camera rather than waiting to open it Christmas morning. I'm really glad I did I tried brand new batteries and batteries that I had used in a mouse and I still couldn't get this thing to turn on. I read the included instructions booklet and made sure to hold the power button down for the suggested time and still nothing. Also - the battery door is a little difficult to open. Oddly enough I think the unit I received was a refurbished model. The instruction book clearly states that the USB cable is not included in the box...but the unit I received came with one. It did not however come with the wrist strap that it said it came with (no big deal just pointing out these are refurbs and not labeled as such)I really wanted to like this camera it's the perfect gift for the person I bought it for. It's a shame she will never see it. I wish I could say something positive about this...
