Did you ever wonder about the outrageously high prices of mid-range cameras when we see a price tag of $1999 for a body only?. Well when I came across the Pentax k-70 and what it offers at this price I couldn't help it but giving it 5 stars. I declined the kit lens due to the distortion issue and lack of Macro capabilities but treated myself to the 16-85mm. The camera offers excellent image quality with lots of details excellent dynamic range very low noise levels in all across ISOs and limitless tweeking options to help getting the best images possible. RAW images at DNG format are easy to use and gets the best out of this camera. Very few minor downfalls like any other camera at any price range but the quality of images is a treat especially when paired with a good lens such as the Pentax 16-85mm that is able to get the best out of a good sensor.
