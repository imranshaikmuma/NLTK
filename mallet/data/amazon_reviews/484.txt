I bought this product recently but soon found out that there are some issues with charging it. For whatever reason the charger that came with the product doesn't seem to work properly and the charging lamp on the camera which is supposed to indicate that it's charging doesn't turn on. I've decided to purchase another charger in hopes that the problem will be fixed but as a certified refurbished product I would've preferred that everything is in working condition right out of the box. As the first time I've ever bought a refurbished product I am incredibly disappointed. Hopefully the next buyer will have a better experience.
