This camera is all around awesome.  I'm switching over from a Nikon D7000 which I've got some great shots out of but I'm really liking this camera so far and the auto focus is beating the pants off the D7000.  I'm not necessarily talking about the speed as I haven't shot any sports/fast moving subjects yet but the accuracy.  I would sometimes have to mess with auto focus fine tuning on the Nikon with different lenses but this X-T2 is pinpoint accurate on 98% of the 500 shots or so that I've taken so far.This being my first Fujifilm camera I am greatly appreciating the approach.  They've just set up the buttons and everything really well and intuitively.  You can take 90% of your pictures without reading the manual but I'd still recommend reading it.  They've included sooo much functionality in this camera that you will have to glean the intricacies from the manual to get that last 10%.  For example I really like being able to change focus manually once I've held the shutter button halfway down to autofocus but this option is something you'll have to find in the menu to turn on (at least on the 56mm lens; for push-pull manual focus lenses like the 16mm this wouldn't be necessary).Picture quality is excellent and I'm really digging the jpeg film simulations.  I think I could get away with mostly shooting in jpeg.  However I will most likely be shooting in RAW+JPEG so I can have more control for the really special shots I might end up getting.  That being said I seriously need to upgrade to some higher speed memory cards and I'd recommend you invest in these too especially if you're going to be shooting any video...at all.So far this camera has been a joy to use and I am excited to pick it up.  I've attached some photos taken with 56mm and 16mm lenses.  They are film sims straight out of the camera with some cropping done prior to uploading.
