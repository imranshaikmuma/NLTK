This is one of the best BLU phones that ive used so far it is super fast the screen is amazing even with the sun above the screen you can still use it obviously not crystal clear but not such a big deal.The battery is what I love the most it charged super fast and lasts a whole day (7am - 11pm) of moderate use with about 30-25% remaining battery.I have it with a 32gb class 10 micro SD that does not use the second SIM slot to work as seen in previous model and gives me no problema whatsoever.The only thing I would complain is about the camera in low light conditions.If you plan on using this phone to take tons of pictures share them over the social networks it might not be as efficient in low light. Is not bad but my vivo Air was better camera wise.If you are looking for a phone to browse the web or social networks listen some music watch videos movies or whatever you do with your phone like making calls it works flawlessly.Also the sound and volumen of the speaker is amazing clear and loud.Buy it try it love it.I shared some photos with sunlight and low light so you can see for yourself the differebce between them.Hope it helps you to take a better decision.
