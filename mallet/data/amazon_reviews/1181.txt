These very expensive insoles are just ok.  I also reviewed the blue ones since people were commenting that greens were for high arches.  I do not find that to be true at all.I have moderate arches using the water test.  I am looking (still) for arch support as are so many others.  We can go to the moon but still not get good arch support.  What is up with that?The greens which I currently have would fit more or less if the arch were farther up the insole towards the toe.  It is situated pretty far back towards the heel so the support only fits part of the arch.  There seems to be a standardized foot that is used by Superfeet as a pattern and it doesn't resemble mine very much.I also have the Powersteps and the Sole.  The Powersteps are pretty comfortable and pretty supportive.  The Soles are thick and reasonably supportive but barely fit in shoes because they are too thick.  Buy everything online because local retailers were selling the Soles for double the online price!I am at a loss to understand why the Superfeet cost almost as much as a pair of shoes.  They have some support but they do not really fit well and there seems to be little to no information on the Superfeet website as to how to get them to work...or not.  Perhaps they really only fit a subsection of feet and mine are not included.I am seriously miffed at spending lots of cash and still end up looking for insoles.
