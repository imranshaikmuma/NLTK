For the price I know I shouldn't complain but... these aren't anything like the real bandanas I grew up with. The cotton is way too big a weave (too low thread count)  The thread they used to weave these is way too coarse. Hold them up to the light you can see straight through it.  I'm hoping they shrink in the wash and tighten up the weave.  The print is just shoddy.  If you are glancing at someone you'll just see "bandana"  but if they are close to you and you look at it none of the print lines up properly and just isn't anywhere close to my bandanas that I've had since the 1970s.  You can definitely tell that pride in workmanship has lost out to mass production over the past decades.  I was expecting they would be a little less than ideal but never this bad.  On the up side... (and yes there is an up side)... they are inexpensive you do get 12 in a pack and my husband and my dogs don't give a hoot what they look like. They are a nice size hold my hair well in several different styles and I'm not complaining "where's my bandana?" all the time anymore.  There's always one at hand and clean.  They make great hankies too.  Buying these made me revere my old bandanas I've babied and pampered since high school all the more.  So I guess it's a good thing I now have a dozen every day bandanas so I save my good ones for the beach or camping where they will be seen by others.
