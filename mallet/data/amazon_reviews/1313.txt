Pros:Easy to useTriple velcro tighteningNot too stiffCons:Cheap material - one tab came out within 1 week of use.Plastic tabsNOT made for long torsos.I have a 29" waist I'm 5'7" 143 lbs athletic build (weight train) - I got a Medium. How does it fit? Well I'm thinking this is made for short torsos or people under 5'4". The medium DID fit well for my waist.Can I return this as defective? Because having one tab bust out in less than one week of use is pretty pathetic.Note: For the first 3 days I only wore this 2 hours each day. 4th-6th day I wore it 2.5 hours. 7th day 3 hours. As much as I would like to increase like everyone is encouraging it's NOT comfortable enough to sit in for more than 45 mins and absolutely NOT made for laying in.
