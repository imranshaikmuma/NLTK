Do not buy this camera without buying an instructional book like Nikon D5500 for Dummies. There are so many features on this camera that I had no idea were there how to get to them or how to use them. I got the Nikon D5500 for Dummies and it has opened up a whole array of amazing features for me to use right on my camera. I am not a professional photographer but because of this awesome easy to use (after reading the book) camera all of my friends are asking me to photograph them and their families. I absolutely love that the price for this camera was lower than Best Buy. Not to mention the warranty offered on Amazon was cheaper and longer!
