I bought these from CCenterprises through amazon. They were described as 100 % cotton. They are not! They are some kind of slick shiny stuff and not at all what I expected. So I contacted amazon to return them. Amazon directed me to go through CCenterprises which I did. I had to return product at my own expense and have not heard since from the company. So today  my patience wearing thin I tracked the package and found out it has been delivered and waiting for them to pick up at facility since Sept. 7. I am highly disappointed with both the product and the customer service! I now have filed another claim through amazon and advised them that this company should not be allowed to sell on their site! ( I went to walmart and bought great real100% cotton bandannas for $1.00 a piece and wish I would have done so in the first place!)
