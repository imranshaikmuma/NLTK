This is my first purchase of an expensive camera. On first impression the camera performs well. I like the snappy auto focus this camera has but do find the shortcoming of it when zoomed to the larger focal lengths like 100 to 150mm. The auto focus seems to hunt a lot at those ranges especially in low light. Image quality is nice. Wouldn't recommend cropping the images because I notice some digital noise when zoomed in. I don't know if that is the camera or user error for being a beginner as well. WiFi capability is soooo useful and works great with the app. Size is small but nice for travel. EVF is great with little to no lag at all. The only disappointing this is that Canon doesn't have fast lenses for this M mount. My next purchase will be the adaptor and a fast EF lens. Overall good camera
