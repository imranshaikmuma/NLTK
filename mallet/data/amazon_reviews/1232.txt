I am an overweight woman so I am harder on my feet shoes and socks than most people. I exercise most days of the week and I mostly use the treadmill and elliptical. With the treadmill I ALWAYS have hot spots on the bottoms of my feet and that just makes me want to quit sooner than I should. They HURT! I decided to do some research on shoes and socks that were supportive and comfortable...and for ME they have to be DURABLE. That's when I found Balega. I read the reviews and finally decided to pay crazy money (or so I thought at the time) for a SINGLE PAIR of socks! "UNHEARD OF" I thought. But...you usually get what you pay for...so I decided to see if these were as exceptional as they seemed. AND THEY ARE. OH MY GOSH. They are THE BEST PAIR OF SOCKS I HAVE EVER HAD. They are soft comfortable supportive cushiony (I know that's not a word but let's pretend it is) on the bottom and in the back (no blisters!) and they let your feet BREATHE. I no longer get hot spots! And in fact my feet felt SO GREAT the first time I wore them that I ACTUALLY RAN ON THE TREADMILL! That's something I've never felt comfortable doing. So not only do these help my feet feel great while exercising but they are ACTUALLY going to help me reach my goals faster by allowing me to do more in my exercise! What could be better?? Nothing as far as I'm concerned. :) Thanks Balega!
