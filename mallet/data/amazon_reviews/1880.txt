I am quite pleased with this little laptop computer. It isn't a game computer but for writing and working on the web it works quite well. I will say that I do play the Windows 10 edition of Minecraft on the laptop with no problems but that isn't really the reason I bought the laptop. I wanted a compact package that I can take with me to work on my writing projects and to do web research and this laptop fits the bill for this purpose. It comes with Windows 10 64bit and I am able to use all the Open Office tools with no problems at all. Surfing the web works well and since I am on a 5G connection and get no lag at all when doing web research. Overall I would recommend this laptop if you need a workhorse for writing web research email or other basic needs and you can get bit of Minecraft on the side as a bonus.
