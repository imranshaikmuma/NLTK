These are beautiful shoes and appeared to be just what I wanted.  Was saddened to find that they fit very differently from my 3 pairs of XP Professional size 40 that fit me perfectly.  My toes touch the end of these Dansko Professionals.  Am returning them and exchanging them for a size 41.  Hopefully they will fit better.  Otherwise I'll just stay with the tried and true XPs.
