I have owned dozens of digital cameras over the years from small compacts models to large DSLRs.  I had the predecessor camera to this one from Sony (DSC-W180). It would fit in my pocket when mountain climbing.  It served me well on my hiking adventures taking videos and stills.It took great pictures and videos and was very rugged.When it hit a rock too many times and the case broke I had to replace it so I ordered this camera figuring a newer Sony would perform better.  Was I wrong.This camera is terrible.First the processing time after you take a picture is very long.  More than a two seconds.  There is no way a camera in 2016 should take so long to process a still picture. It is very annoying.Second. the battery life is very short.  Probably half the battery life of my older camera.Third the flash is terrible.  Again it performs worse than the first generation of digital cameras. It producing strong "Flash in the face" look where peoples faces are over exposed.  This is cause by poor feedback circuits in the flash control system.  I played with all the flash settings and it never worked well.Finally in low light the camera is just OK (without a flash).  I would have hoped for better with the backside illuminated sensor.I think the designers of this camera tried to jam more pixels into the camera for this model and took a hit on all the other parameters of the camera.I am planning to throw away the camera and get a different one.
