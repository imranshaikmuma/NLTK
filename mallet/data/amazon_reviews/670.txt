The IPhone 6Plus Gold 64 GB I got it today and it was very nice. no iCloud account on it or anything. phone works great no errors . no scratches. only thing is there is a scratch on the bottom next to the headphone jack. like it was hit on a rock. I believe the old owner sold this phone because of this. lol. phone screen 0 scratches. as well screen works fine and apps works as well its unlocked. mummy the charger that came with the phone was not the original and no headphones and the original box too not there. Just a note to you guys. who ever got the phone on bad terms I did read and was scared a bit. I believe your stories. I guess its about luck who gets it 100% good shape or bad. mine is 99% only that scratch that nobody can see. this my first day using it. hope in the next few days wouldn't have a problem.
