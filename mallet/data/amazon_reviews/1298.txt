Somehow I got these boots for $4 as an add on item and i assumed they would be junk. I took a trip to the snow today thinking I would purchase quality boots later they do make a crunching sound and appear to be thin cheap material but I was extremely pleasantly surprised! A whole day playing in the snow and my feet stayed warm and dry they do not feel cheap once they are on. I am thrilled with them and wont be wasting more money on expensive boots. Actually  my wife was wearing a $150 pair of sorrel boots and complained that her toes were cold! Even if i paid the full price of $50 i would say well worth it.
