The good:  Phone looks excellent.The bad (well annoying but not bad bad) Battery was completely dead but seems to be taking a charge.  Won't be activating the phone (more on that) but I'm gonna let it charge and update this later.  (Update...phone activated on Straight Talk and seems to be working properly)The ugly:  I ordered "Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM (Certified Refurbished)" that clearly states in the description: Factory unlocked iPhones are GSM models and are ONLY compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile as well as other GSM networks around the world. They WILL NOT WORK with CDMA carriers like Sprint Verizon and the likes.  However...I just got the package and the phone has a "Carrier VERIZON Model IPhone 6 sticker on the back!  So....what exactly did I get?  Have to wait and see...I emailed the seller (DealFisher) and am trying to research the MEID and IMEI.  The model number for both is 1549 so that's not much help.Update:  Apple says it's unlocked and not identified as lost/stolen or anything bad like that.  DealFisher says it's unlocked too.  Jury is still out on issues with Straight Talk and Verizon and traveling but phone seems to work and is in great shape battery seems to be holding and seller responded and is willing to work with me if there are issues...updated to 4 stars.
