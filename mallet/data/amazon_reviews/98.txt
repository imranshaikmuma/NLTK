I bought my D300 back in 2008 and I paid 2k for it. It was a great camera but I had to sell it because the expected replacement ( D400 ) was never made by Nikon so I decided to go with FX and I bought the D750.When this camera D500 was announced I decided to buy it right away and I do not regret. I am paying for it the same price I paid for my beloved D300 but this one is way better than my D300.Excellent AF system excellent frame rate are just some of the positive things about this camera. The most important things for me is the AF system which is superb. Once you lock on your subject it won't fail as far as you continue keeping your focus point on the subject as it moves. It does not matter if you are using d25 d72 Group or 3D tracking it will continue focusing at 10fps and it won't fail at all. You will have more keepers than not. It does not matter if something is in front or back of your subject the camera will continue focusing on your subject rather than being fooled by things around your subject. It is simple amazing and it is very fun to use.You can also use this camera for low light photography. Personally I will not use it above ISO 6400 but that way above the ISO that you could use with the D300 or any other DX camera in the market today. The camera feels secure in your hand and you have the feeling that you are in control all the time. Even though we are missing the U1 and U2 I still give it a 5 stars review. I do recommend it to whoever want to have the best DX camera out there.
