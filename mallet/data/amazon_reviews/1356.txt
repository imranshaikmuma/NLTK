I received my order within about 3 working days of having ordered it and found the packaging to be great - packed in a sturdy hinged box (suitable for gift giving) inside a padded envelope - well protected.  The necklace exceeded expectations - I figured it would be  a very small heart but it is about 1" wide at the widest part and is quite beautiful.  The back side is silver filigree and it could be worn with either side facing out!  I have worn it to work twice and  have received compliments on it each time.  This is a piece I bought for myself because it struck me as beautiful - I'm not one to wear anything but my wedding ring and a religious medal in the way of jewelry. The only change I would make would be the length of the chain as I prefer longer necklaces - but that is just a personal preference and easily remedied.  Met and exceeded my expectations!  Lovely piece.
