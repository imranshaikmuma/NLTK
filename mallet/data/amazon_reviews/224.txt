First off let me state that I never write reviews but I'm so happy my doorman had this waiting for me yesterday evening. After getting acquainted with my new camera a bit I have to say it's truly a big step up from the sx30 (which I also own). The camera seems more responsive overall. The auto definitely works better. Pictures are crystal clear. And low light pictures are simply amazing. I even tested ISO 3200 with a nightlight and it produced a usable image with very little noise. Also since the camera is more responsive to low light the zoom seems to work much better because low light zoom pics are very clear and have negligible noise.. This camera is simply a wonderful value for the money. Buy it.
