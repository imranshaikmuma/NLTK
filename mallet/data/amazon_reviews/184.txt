Finally received the EOS M5-M with the 15-45 STM kit lens. The camera feels great in my hands and I'm really enjoying having a touch screen for the first time on a camera. The build quality of the camera is fine and the back screen and viewfinder are super sharp and bright.The kit lens seems fine but I need to really do more testing. It's very small but feels good in the hand and fits the body nicely. I picked up the Fotodiox Pro Lens Adapter with Auto-Exposure/Auto-Focus & Auto-Aperture (EF to EOSm - Auto) so I will be using this with some L glass. (Had a weird experience with that adapter. At first it would not autofocus. After a minute it kicked in I'm not sure if this delay is normal or not. If this continues I might need to return it for the more expensive Canon Version - Canon EOS M Mount Adapter )Since it showed up after dark I've only done a few test shots. Did a few with available light and was amazed at how good the image stabilization worked at super slow shutter speeds. Decided to see how the menus worked with 600EX-RT Speedlite controlled by the ST-E3-RT. Menus where just like what I have on my 5D MIII only of course with the touch screen.Very happy but honestly I haven't done very much with the camera yet. As I use and test it I'll update this review.
