Update1/31/17Blu allowed an "update" through its wireless update app that has put malware on my phone. I can't remove and Blu is not providing assistance.  Don't buy their phones they don't have the infrastructure like Apple and Samsung that is needed to update the OS and keep our info safe.11/2016 Love this phone everyone who sees it oohs and aahs. When they see see "BLU" on the back of the phone they are thoroughly confused.  I am one of the early converts to cutting cords and contracts for cable and phone and anything else. This phone is high high quality and the price is not cheap it is simply how much a phone is supposed to cost. Especially when you know technology changes and you will scratch your tech itch in another 2 years. Their phones come with everything you need including a screen protector and a phone cover that will not hide the cool sealed metal handset. The fingerprint recognition is much better than my Samsung Galaxy ever was. It's not buggy takes good pictures smoothly plays videos call volume and call quality is excellent. Thanks to Google seamless transition of apps and contacts.Cons- That being said I have played with it for a month and there are 3 issues. I have downloaded security software to monitor my web activity. When I set this as a default action in settings (hard to locate too) the system will ignore what I have done and turn off my changes. 2nd issue I use cast at times to show websites on my TV through Roku. This option at times simply does not work.  This being said the cause could be because it uses Android 6.0 Marshmallow as an operating system. While other providers have updated patches BLU has not. I have no idea if my phone will even contemplate upgrading to 7.0 Nougat. The lack of updates could be a major no go for some consumers. Also I hate the ugly finger shaped emoji and wish I didn't have to download an ad riddled app for more choices.
