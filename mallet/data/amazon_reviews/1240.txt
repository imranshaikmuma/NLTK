I'm a thick and curvy webcam model... and it is kinda hard to find products that fit me properly and still add to the sexy look I'm going for.These are the BEST stockings I've discovered for my thick thighs. I ordered close to 7 different pairs of stockings when I was searching for something that would fit. Dreamgirl Plus Size were the ONLY ones that fit me. ALL of the ones I ordered were "Plus Size" or "Queen"... and made it look like my legs were getting pinched off. Then I tried Dreamgirl and I haven't looked back!I love the silicone under the lace at the top... helps keep them up. Of course after a few times of using them they need to be hand washed in cold water to keep the silicone sticky. Obviously your skin particles and sweat are going to get the silicone dirty and they will start rolling/sliding down after just a few seconds of movement. Keep them clean and they stay up every time.The ONLY complaint I really have is that I wish the nylon material was a bit better quality.This is the second pair of these that I have purchased and I only had the first pair for about 3 months before they got a run in them.So it would be nice if the material were thicker and of better quality... but for the price... I can't complain to much. lolMy roommate was kind enough to do my laundry for me one weekend while I was gone.... and she washes in HOT WATER. She also doesn't separate her clothes into delicates etc. So... these got washed in hot water and then put in the dryer. (Love her to death but... NO!)So after that the silicone was cracked and didn't stick as well. DO NOT WASH IN THE WASHING MACHINE UNLESS YOU USE COLD WATER. Or just hand wash them. Super quick and easy. DO NOT DRY THEM IN THE DRYER... let them air dry!They look sexy and fit well on a tick woman. If you're considering it.... consider no more... do it!
