A little loose but that let it slouch nicely so I didn't mind. I've had this hat for a while but haven't had an opportunity to wear it until recently. It's been great for about two weeks but I went to put it on today and the top unstitched itself and is now just a gaping hole. Very disappointed as it was a good hat until it just fell apart.
