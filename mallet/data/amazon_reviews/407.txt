We bought this for our 8 year old son as a gift and he loves it!  Yes it goes through batteries very quickly but we just turn off the flash most of the time and they last a little longer.  The quality is actually not bad but it's perfect for a child that is just learning and having his own camera.  The pictures are easy to upload to the computer as well.  And if he drops it or scratches it at least it wasn't extremely expensive either.  It's great for a first time camera.  The only thing I was disappointed in is the description stated  "Snap and store up to 120 images using the 8MB of built-in memory or insert a SD/SDHC card to expand its memory capabilities and snap many more pictures."  Well because I was basing it off that I didn't buy the memory card.  After receiving the camera it was clear that I HAD to have the memory card because the camera wouldn't work without it.  Granted the memory card was like $5-$6 but it's the whole point.  Don't have it in the description if it's not true.  All in all I'm pretty happy with it.  More importantly my son loves it!
