While I am generally happy with the phone overall I did encounter a MAJOR PROBLEM with Samsung this phone and buying international phones in the domestic USA. The sim tray on the Galaxy S7 is incredibly cheap plastic. It broke in half - with part of the tray stuck INSIDE the SIM assembly on the phone.The Amazon ad clearly designates that there is no warranty. That's helpful to know. However when I contacted Samsung asking for help (i.e. - LET ME PAY YOU TO FIX MY PHONE) I was told that because this was an international phone the domestic Samsung people will not help me.So I'm left right now with a device that I cannot use (that I purchased 3 months ago) because I cannot remove the plastic component that broke inside the phone. This would typically be covered by warranty but there is no warranty on this device. I cannot pay to get it fixed by the manufacturer because they won't touch it.So because of poor support and lack of recourse I really would not recommend anyone go the route of purchasing an international variant Samsung device in the US.
