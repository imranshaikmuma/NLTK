This is the best phone I have had in a long time!!!!  I've been a Samsung user for about 3 years and when I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 I quickly became very disappointed.  The battery life of the S7 was poor to say the least.  I was skeptical about trying a new phone but I'm so glad I did.  The battery life of the Moto G Play is AWESOME and the phone is fast and efficient.  VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!!!
