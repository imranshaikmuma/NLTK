As someone who works at a gym I have seen my fair share of crap athletic wear these are actually very nice. Now I'm a runner I've got big legs and big calves so I'm normally someone who goes for a large even XL but I have a medium here and they fit my legs great. They do feel a bit tight in the tummy area though. Muffin top is a thing with these leggings. I'm hoping once I wear them out and wash em a bunch they'll lose a bit of resistance there. As for athletic material? Eh. It's not gonna take sweat away in fact these feel warm my legs are a bit hotter than the rest of me at this moment be prepared to sweat but hey that's a good thing!I've included some pictures for reference I'm 5'0" and 190lbs. Included a not so fabulous butt shot to show the opacity no undies peeking through. They're nice and solid.  (Excuse the mess of clothes! It's laundry day!)
