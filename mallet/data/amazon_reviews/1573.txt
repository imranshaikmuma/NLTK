I admit that I read the reviews of horrible consistency but the main review I read was posted in 2013 and I stupidly believed Carhartt might have listened in two years. Boy was I ever WRONG!! Sadly I also read far too many of the perhaps BOGUS FAKE REVIEWS that have infected Amazon and hit the purchase now button. DUMB REALLY REALLY DUMB.... D'oh.....On October 22 2015 I ordered three Original Fit K-87 t-shirts all on the same order and all came in one package. Here is what I got.Burgundy K-87 T-Shirt - Made In MexicoTan K-87 T-Shirt - Made In HaitiCharcoal K-87 T-Shit - Made In HondurasNone of these shirts fit like the other & none of them are the same weight cloth. This is a ridiculous JOKE. This is my absolute last Carhartt purchase. I keep waiting for the Candid Camera guy to poke around the corner and tell me this was just a joke or that I wake up from the bad dream. Sadly I am awake and this is what a once good name Carhartt has become a PATHETIC JOKE....It is a shame the failings of America or rather race to the bottom have now impacted Carhartt too..... If I had wanted to gamble I would have gone to Vegas... Sad very very very sad... Carhartt you should be ashamed at this horrifically inconsistent  crap you foist upon us!Three shirts three countries you can't make this crap up....!!
