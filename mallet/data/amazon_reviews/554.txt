My son was home not answering his phone and I needed to get in touch with him. I turned on the speaking function and called his name. Teo secs later he comes to the camera and I asked that he call me. Score for Spot.I was late getting home and walked my son through making meatballs with us on the phone and me watching him. When I came home dinner was ready in 15 min- not 45.  Double score!Honestly it's really cool. There's night vision speaking and listening functions you can take photos and you can inset a micro disc. The fact that this is all done wirelessly and the feed is through my phone is huge. I currently have two cameras and am going to buy two more. The fact I can check to make sure my family is safe and also when we are away that the pets are good is so comforting!!
