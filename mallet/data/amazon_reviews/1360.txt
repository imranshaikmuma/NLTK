I'm not a fan of huge flare-legged pants.  In an XL the flares on many pant styles are large enough to fit my entire shoe inside... while I'm standing.  I left the JNCO jeans in the 90s guys... perhaps you should too...  ;)  I'm also not a fan of the elastic-at-the-ankle look.  I just wanted some regular straight-up scrub pants with a cargo pocket... is that too much to ask??These mostly meet my desires.  At 5'4 many scrubs tend to be long for my legs but these are actually ok. I wish the ankle were just slightly more boot-cut but it's really ok.  The elastic is fine and I like that they're higher-waisted.  This keeps me from mooning people when I bend over or even just sit.  Say no to crack right?  Yeah.As per the quality they're decent but nothing more.  Overall I'm happy.
