This is my second lenovo Yoga (my first is a Yoga 3 14").  I bought this because I liked the utility of the first.  For the price this is best 2 in 1 out there.  I think the poor keyboard and high price of the Surface Pro make this a superior option.  The shift key is a legitimate concern.  I gave it 2 days to get used to and could not take it any longer so I went the keytweak program and remapped the keys then physically swapped them and problem solved.Very pleased with this purchase.
