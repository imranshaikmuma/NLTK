I am writing in case this is helpful.  I am 5'9" 160 pounds very long thin legs and wide hips.  I wear a 12 pants most of the time; sometimes a 10.  I really struggled with whether to order the medium tall or the large tall.  Previously I had ordered large talls in the Romeo pant and they were enormous.  I returned them for the medium tall which was much too tight!  I ended up ordering the medium talls in the Grace cut (which is why I said they fit somewhat large - I am never a medium on bottom).  They fit great!! I like them better than the Romeos.  I hope they wear well!
