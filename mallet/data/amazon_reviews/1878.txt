ordered and received: Laptop OnlyThis Asus' 15.6-inch powerhouse offers plenty of performance. My husband did a lot of researching on laptops and really found this one to be one of the top rankings for the price range and it's features. We really count on reviews for our buying decisions. I had never hear of this brand before but my husband has and he's been wanting to get an ASUS brand lap top for awhile now. He finally did away with his old one that wasn't holding any battery life anymore.Although this is a gaming laptop we don't play games on it most likely at least I won't. We got it for when we sit on the couch so he can still do his work or I can. And he wanted for when he travels for work. And the sound quality? WOW very impressive I must say.I love the feel of how the keys are and how smooth they press. You won't find a more vibrant screen on any laptop. Featuring the latest Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M graphics this laptop enables you to stream HD videos run MS Office programs and gaming with ease and so fast. I was amazed at how fast it is.Really love the matte screen finish. Watching movies with super sharp detail was also amazing.PROS:classy gray metallic cover and hairline-textured finish.impressive battery life;great valuevery good graphics performancepalm rest and light weightCONS:none that we can tell right now. As we continue to use it if we find anything wrong or more to write I will come back with an update.OVERALL: If you want a portable powerful windows 10 ready for a reasonable price you can bank on this one.
