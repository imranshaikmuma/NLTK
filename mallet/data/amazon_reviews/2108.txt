So far it's been working perfectly! The touchscreen works. The DVD burner works. I haven't had the chance to play many games on it yet but it's able to handle Sister Location at least. (My old laptop R.I.P wasn't even able to play those games without almost overheating.) It's quick and I'm able to have programs such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop along with others open at the same time without it causing any problems. As of now I'm 100% satisfied with it and I'd recommend this to anyone who's in need of a nice but cheap laptop.
