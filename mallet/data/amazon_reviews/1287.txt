I don't understand why these got such good ratings. I would not recommend these to a friend. I purchased in hopes to use them during first trimester pregnancy. I tried them on as soon as I received them and they fit accordingly they were long enough and they fit well. I didn't like the super cottony feel of them and they were a tad bit stiff with little give. I washed them according the instructions and keep in mind I NEVER wash in hot water always cold and I never dry on high heat only low or extra low. They SHRUNK at least two sizes after I washed them. They are no longer long enough and they are too tight to wear now. I was super disappointed so I contacted the company and they told me there was nothing they could do and that I only had 30 days to return them. Most companies stand by their products and offer returns so another disappointment. Would not recommend this product.
