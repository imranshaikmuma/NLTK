** UPDATED REVIEW: I have many pairs of these pants from 90 Degrees (all ordered from the 90 Degrees store on Amazon) and re-ordered 2 pairs last week (black and maroon). The pants I received were KNOCK OFFS SHIPPED FROM CHINA! (See pictures attached). They came in random Korean packaging the maroon leggins were bright red and they had "medium" labels but were clearly XS-XXS. I turned the back inside out to show that they don't have the "90 Degree by Reflex" logo screen printed on it as well. FAKE FAKE FAKE. I'm so disappointed I've never had a problem ordering from them until now. 90 Degree by Reflex refused to acknowledge their responsibility so I had to settle this dispute with Amazon. Disappointed in their customer service.I've tried so many brands of athletic pants from Ross all the way to Nike and these have definitely been my favorite in terms of durability material and price. They're super comfortable and not see through at all. I have thicker calves than the average girl and have always struggled to find capri pants that won't rise up to my knees once I start moving and these leggings definitely rest perfectly mid-calf during my workouts. Shipping also was MUCH faster than expected so that was a big bonus. I'll definitely be re-ordering in as many colors as I can :)
