Great little walk around camera which is what I bought it for. Got tired of lugging all my gear just so I would have a camera in the car for those times when I would say "I wish I had my camera". I normally shoot with a Nikon D7200. Obviously the quality of the B700 is not the same but for the money and convenience it's a nice camera.I especially like the fact that it shoots in RAW format. Great for first time photographers as you can shoot in manual ( which is the best way to learn in my opinion) or just put it on Auto. There's also shutter and aperture priority. Or good for people like myself who just want something to always have with me without having to spend a fortune. I added a couple sample photos to show the quality. Both were shot in manual mode but I'm sure you can get just as good shots shooting in Auto Priority etc.
