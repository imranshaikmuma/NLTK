I have always had a great experience with Acer. This one is no different. For my use it does what I want and fast. I had two spare 8 gb RAM which I used to expand the memory to 16 gb. The boot up time is amazingly fast - it is hardly 10 seconds if that. I like its simple appearance too. And for a 15.5 inch screen it is amazingly lightweight and has a numerical pad (useful for you accountants).Be warned - don't use it for heavy duty gaming. This is not a gaming laptop. It is very fast and you should be able to accomplish a lot of multimedia tasks with this. But that is not to say you run wild with high resolution games. Low key games are fine. But I would not advise anything more than that.I know there are a lot of PC/Windows 10 haters out there. But Windows 10 really has improved a lot from 8 8.1 and the original 10 version. It functions smoothly and I have encountered no issues. I would say that you not listen to the blind criticisms of Windows 10. It's good.This has been a reaffirmation of my trust in Acer. Their computers have so far not only "not disappointed" me but they have been a pleasure to use. I am glad I made the decision to choose Acer again over the other brands out there. The only other brand I personally trust is HP. But that is a different story.
