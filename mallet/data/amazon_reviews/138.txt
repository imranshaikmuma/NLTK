The bad. I wish I waited another week and I could have saved $10! The good. Everything. (No tech-spec review here--get that elsewhere). This is my 5th Pentax digital camera. I recently sold off everything thinking I was gong to take the leap into mirrorless. But after a full week of research (hands-on videos reviews ratings etc.) I realized this camera is everything I need still. So at just over $700 the decision was simple. Very small compared to other DSLR's. Built like a tank. Fits perfect in my hands. Easy to carry for a couple hours (with hand strap) with a shorter lens. Great in low-light. Awesome 8fps for sports and wildlife. Super quiet shutter compared to the other brands. With 2 or 3 of the pancakes lenses (can be had used for cheap) a nice 2.8 mid-range zoom and maybe a longer zoom for sports/wildlife is all anyone will ever need. And WAAAY cheaper than any of the mirrorless systems out there. I priced out the top (my top ) 3 mirrorless...Fuji Samsung Olympus and the best I could do for any body and a fast prime lens was over $2k close and $3K if you tried to add a second prime lens!! I got this body 3 Yongnuo flashes a trigger a 50mm prime a 17-70 prime and a new tripod for well under $2k. You do the math.For anyone that STILL for whatever reason has any hesitation about joining the Pentax community just do it. I completely understand it but as soon as you hold this camera you will be in love with it. And you can take this Everywhere All The Time! That is a huge bonus in my book.  For the lazy or inexperienced there are numerous and very nice auto settings filters etc but this camera excels when you make it do what YOU want it to do. So save yourself hours of research and flow charts trying to figure out what camera/system is the "best". I did all that again and ended right back where I started. I couldn't be happier.
