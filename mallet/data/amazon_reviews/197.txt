We bought this camera primarily for my wife and our photography business. We have both been using the Nikon D7000 but didn't upgrade when the D7100 came out because it seemed to be an incremental upgrade and not worth the cost at least at that time. The D7200 on the other hand was quite a jump from our D7000 and we decided to pull the trigger and get one after hearing of the product release.The D7200 has performed perfectly and the jump in low light capabilities helps tremendously. We may not upgrade our second D7000 this year but will definitely be getting another D7200 when we do.
