This fit so comfortably!! I ordered the purple in a size small. I am 5" 8 with measurements of 34-27-35. This has some stretch and some adjustability with the tie neck and the g-string. I have a slightly long torso not super long but this fit great. I loved wearing this! I felt really sexy in it and my boyfriend was very pleased! This was so comfortable that I was able to sleep in it so I didn't have to change into pajamas. Totally worth the price and I would buy more from this company. Prior to wearing I did cut the tag out so it looked better on. It wasn't to hard to remove. Honestly if more lingerie was this comfortable I would wear it all the time. Buy this you won't regret it.
