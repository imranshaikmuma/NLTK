Great camera and kit for a amateur photographer. My husband actually bought this camera for me with the 18-55 lens and I returned it for the 18-140 mm. That was definitely a good decision- minimal cost and size difference for a huge upgrade in range. Instead of always carrying around a 18-55mm and a 55-300mm I only use this one lens for daily use. Different story if you're a professional but for someone who doesn't want to carry around multiple lenses this is the best kit.I would recommend against buying the camera with accessories packages. They may seem like a good deal but typically contain useless or poor-quality accessories so it's not worth it in the end. Put good thought into what you need and then research your options... or you'll find yourself with a cheap quality accessories that ruin your photos. This camera is capable of taking amazing pictures only if the accessories don't ruin the quality.
