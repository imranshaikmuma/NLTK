Love love LOVE these socks!!  Smart purchase!  Exactly as advertised but BETTER!  Breatheable and soft.  The gel on the heel is perfect.  They stay put and are perfectly hidden when wearing my Sperrys!!!  I attached pics so you could see!  Usually socks are a tad big since my foot is only a 5. Love these!
