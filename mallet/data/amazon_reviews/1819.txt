This does not feel like a $320 laptop.  The backlit keyboard the 1080p display and the overall solid (if plastic) build make this feel like a $500+ machine.  I had read reviewers who said the HDD was terribly slow and I'm guessing if you're used to an SSD it is pretty slow.  But I've been using budget HDDs all my life and this is faster than any of those have been.  My worries that I'd have to bump up to a SSD and add some more RAM before I got my money's worth have been assuaged.  I may do so in time if I decide to try and run Skyrim but that isn't a priority just now.  Also one little thing I especially like is the placement of the power button: it's inline with the function keys all the way to the right.
