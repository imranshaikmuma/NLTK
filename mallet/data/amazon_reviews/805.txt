I urge anyone reading this to not purchase this phone. I am not sure what I should have expected knowing the purchase price for a cell phone was so low but I would have been able to overlook the extremely slow performance lack of available storage and horrible camera quality if I could have gotten the phone to power on reliably. It would go to sleep then we would have to hold in the power button to turn it back on sometime as many as 10 times to "maybe" get the phone to turn back on.Amazon was fantastic and took the thing back immediately which is a testament to their incredible service.I now understand that the "DASH" portion of the name describes the thoughtless manner in which they assemble these phones.
