Nikon has my attention. Owning several cameras during my life at 68 I am a more seasoned user since I did take photos for many years with a Mamiya 1000 DTL SLR and numerous lenses and filters. Now I am seeking the lightest weight camera with the highest megapixels and a decent zoom ability - with a user friendly in-camera menu... and of course a better battery source than rechargeable alkaline batteries (which I find very frustrating at best). I own a ten year old Fuji Finepix E550 - and for it's time a great little light weight camera. I have reviewed the real manual (which is downloadable through the Nikon website) - and printed out pages I need to review until they are memorized. The in-camera menus are* intuitive and while the screen is tiny for my tired old eyes - put on your reading glasses and proceed! The buttons and menus are well organized - the "on/off" button is a little tiny but unless you have super large hands - should not be an issue. Not having a 'view finder' is a drawback - but in such a tiny camera I will get used to using the screen.  My first few photos taken were excellent and I am a happy camper. I hope this camera holds up well since I love it already.
