I mainly choose WonderWink for my scrub pants and they do typically run small especially in the seat and maybe the thighs. These pants altho they are flare style are pretty form fitting and do not look wide at all. The material is comfortable but the stretch-factor isn't too noticeable. The pockets are flattering.My only issue is the inconsistency of sizing here compared to other Wonderwink styles. I ordered L-Petite but it fits me like a M in their other styles. I am normally a 8-10 pant size so that would qualify for M. However I tend to buy L-Petite so that I have enough room to bend over and not have my pants come down (as often happens to me with scrub pants). So it seems like I would need to order XL-Petite in this style order to not have the pants feel like they will slide down when bending down.
