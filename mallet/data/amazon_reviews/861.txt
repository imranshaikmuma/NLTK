If it was possible to give zero stars I would. This phone I received was deceivingly marketed as being brand new. It was not. I have not had my phone 4 months before the touch pad was not working and the screen kept blanking out. i took it by the phone repair guy  who took one look and told me this phone has been used already and someone had removed the screen and did not stick it back. AMAZON I am isgusted my this deception.
