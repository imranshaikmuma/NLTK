Just got this laptop. The setup/configuration only took 15 mins or so. The laptop is pretty fast at least for basic things like browsing skype and most other things that I need while traveling even with 4GB of RAM. Very fast to boot. Giving the product 4 stars because Lenovo phone tech support is an outsourced nightmare on two feet. Unless something is written in front of their faces in a script they will have no clue about anything. Otherwise the product is good.
