Very cute! After reading many reviews on here I decided to order a medium. I am approx 5' and wear size 3-5 in pants and a 34DDD. The top was small (as expected! But sexy small so it works) and it is definitely more suited for someone much taller. I have about 1-2" of fabric that bunches in the middle as my torso is not long enough. Overall though I am extremely happy with it and my husband loooooves it. A quick stitch will fix the length in the torso and it will be perfect.
