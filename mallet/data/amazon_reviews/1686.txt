UGH I LOVE THESE SNEAKERS. I am new to sneaker buying except fot the occational gym sneakers which I never payed attention too. So I bought these because I wanted a pair of sneakers that would be cute with my outfits and still provide me comfort when I am walking most of the day in the city. These sneakers do both. Also they are super easy to clean and maintain. I have another pair which is suede from adidas and those are a nightmare to keep clean but with these I don't worry at all.
