I purchased the pants at a local uniform store but they did not have any tops so I ordered this one online.  Urbane is a great brand the material is strong but has a soft polished professional look.  I have the Bailey cargo pants that work perfectly with this top.  If you are a plus size like me than go with Urbane.  I like my clothes just a little loose but if you want a snug fit you may want to go down a size.  I will be buying this brand for a long time.
