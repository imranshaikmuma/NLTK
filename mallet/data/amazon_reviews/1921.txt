Purchased this as a capable workstation for CUDA code development as well as having the capability to upgrade to 32 GB RAM to load large data sets related to my PhD thesis. A few quick specs of the components included when I purchased it on January 6th 2016:LCD panel: N156HGE-EAL (TN 30-pin EDP 94% NTSC however 15/15/85/85 view angles) -- can easily be swapped with other IPS/PLS models such as B156HAN01.2 or LTN156HL01-B01 which offer at least 85/85/85/85 view anglesM.2 (SATA) SSD: HFS256G39TND-N210A (SK Hynix 256GB SC308 M.2 2280)Optical Drive: HL-DT-STDVDRAM_GUE1NWiFi card: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377It does have a spare 2.5" SATA slot in which I have installed a 1TB 2.5" SSD. Acer sells an $8 bracket on their website for holding the drive in place but I found that the fit is very tight and can interfere with the ribbon cable used for the HD AUDIO connection. causing the sound card to not be detected. I ended up just cutting a few sheets of paper and placing them on top of the drive to hold it in place such as to avoid any rattling. Most likely a thin piece of foam could also be used as well for this purpose. I upgraded the memory w/ 2x16GB DDR4 SODIMMs with no issue and tested fine with MemTest86 7.2 with no errors after 4 passes.Like others said the touch pad and palm-rest tends to be a bit of a fingerprint oil magnet but not a big deal as it can be wiped down. Note that the USB-C port is capped at 5Gbps speeds but supposedly can supply 5V @ 3A according to Acer's website when you input your SNID and look at the information there. I was able to upgrade the included Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Education by simply entering the product key from my university's Microsoft Imagine subscription and in the same way license the included pre-installed version of Office 2016 as Office 365 with my organization's credentials which made for a fast setup without having to clean install the operating system or any software. Very little bloatware mostly just the Apps that come with the Windows store and you can create recovery media for a clean factory install in a 8GB or larger USB drive.Idling it barely makes any noticeable noise from the fan and is cool to the touch. Have not done much stress testing but fan seems to put out hot air as it should when installing software or syncing a large amount of files to Dropbox as expected. This might be the first PC in a while that I have NOT had to upgrade from the default components to be quick/speedy -- well done Acer!I did swap the original TN panel with a Samsung PLS LTN156HL01-B01 panel and color calibrated it with a Spyder4Pro and it looks quite nice.
