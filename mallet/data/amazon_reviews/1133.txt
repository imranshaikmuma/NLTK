When I first received it I was worried but it definitely was a tight squeeze. I ordered a M and I'm 5'3" 150lbs if that helps anyone else decide what size to get. I've worm this for an hour or more at a time every day since I've gotten home and I feel like it even helps with my back pain. It's a little uncomfortable to sit in/ but thats basically because I'm stuffing all my fat into a corset haha. Not sure if i'd actually wear it out because the boning is obvious and I'm not sure how long I could survive sitting in it all night! Good Luck!
