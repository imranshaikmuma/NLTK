After reading some "it runs small" reviews I ran a size up... and that was not at all correct. Whatever shirt size you wear buy that. It will be a little bigger than your shirt size (...as it is outerwear) but will fit exactly as it should. I'm 6'3" and 220 lbs and the Large was exactly as it should be.
