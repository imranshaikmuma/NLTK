If you find yourself running a chainsaw and dont want to deal with chaps these are the pants for you. They are very thick and might just save you a trip to the ER. i was cutting trees on a hill on my property lost my footing and the saw caught me in the leg. See attached photo. That could have been my knee all i got was a small cut. Just put a new chain on and it was sharp. Thank you carhartt! Will be ordering again.
