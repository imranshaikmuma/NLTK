I only need 3 things from my computer. Word Excel and internet access. So after Windows 10 and Microsoft tech support destroyed my PC I replaced it with an LG Chromebase. Very happy with the Google OS and will never go back to a tradition PC...Wanted something for my workshop so I could have internet and music (all you need is a 3.5 to RCA cable to play music from nearly any stereo system) so I decided to go with the Samsung Chromebook. Very glad that I did. Set up took 5 minutes. All I had to do is was log onto my Google account and it replicated exactly the configuration I have on the LG Chromebase. How great is that! Did not have to spend hours tweaking the setup like you have to on a traditional computer. Very happy with the Samsung Chromebook. Does everything I want it to and not loaded up with programs that i will never use.
