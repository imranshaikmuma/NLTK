The Canon Rebel T6 is also known as the 1300D throughout the world. Without getting too technical this model is a great entry level camera for novice photographers to learn the art of photography. The two lenses that are included provide the ability to take desirable photos near and far. It would be useful for anyone ordering this camera to remember lens filters in order to protect the lenses from debris and damage. You will need a few memory cards and extra batteries are always useful. The wifi feature means easy uploading to your smartphone for social media posting or sending via e-mail. I have used the Canon Rebel series in the past and have had good luck with the model.
