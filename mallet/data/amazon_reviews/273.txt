I just used this device for 2 weeks in a row while traveling in Europe with 2 DSLRs. I am not giving it 5 stars because one of my cameras got loose and dropped to the ground. Fortunately nothing happened to it! $4000.00 worth of equipment dropping to the ground!! I then made sure that the screws remained tight and on the narrow section of the plate and I did not have any more problems afterwards. It allows you to have your hands free to carry other things as needed and the cameras are handy on the spot.
