Tops are not proportional to pants and conveniently the only size chart provided is for the tops. Ordered 5 pairs in large based on top size chart (and the fact that the rest of my scrubs are women's medium or large) and while the top measurements seemed accurate the pants were very small in relation. Received an email asking to address concerns by replying rather than leaving a review immediately so I replied with the sizing issue. Their response? "oh ok."  Returned all 5 pairs and ordered 5 extra large. Pants fit snugly but comfortably but the top is too large.  On the first wear the draw string ripped from the seam of one pair. I understand you get what you pay for and I love the style of these but for the same price you can mix and match(if needed)  a pair at Walmart that will last longer than one wear.
