This is my favorite of all my cameras.  Im a licensed contractor and I put this time lapse up while getting a job done.  After one day I watched the video and its incredible.  Such a great idea! I have been putting the time lapse videos on our website and facebook and its getting a lot of attention. The camera is really easy and puts the images into a video for you so you really just film then take the memory card out and put it into your computer.  Boom you're done. Just a heads up that I would purchase a 32G or 64G memory card for it because the memory card it comes with gets filled up quickly.
