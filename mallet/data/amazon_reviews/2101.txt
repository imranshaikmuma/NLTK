i had to buy a used one because the new models on amazon.com don't ship to Canada (i managed to find a seller that would ship it to Canada but it was used).. still love it though and glad i bought it... i find that this hp chromebook is slightly faster and snappier than my HP Chromebook 14-ak050nr model... and it can handle more open tabs as well!! which i really like!! (im a heavy youtube watcher- i will have 10 or more youtube tabs open at once for days on end and this model handles it better than my ak050nr model- which struggles with 6 youtube tabs)... (not only can i have 15 tabs of youtube open but i can also browse  other sites at the same time like facebook dailymail yahoo weathernetwork news articles etc. without any issues.. which my other model can't handle without lagging and crashing)i like how the keyboard is black rather than white- and i like how the outside of the laptop is black rather than grey or white like some of the other models (makes it look more sleek and professional)... keyboard and speakers are still the same like every other model (pretty good if you ask me)... i wish i could have bought this laptop brand new but they don't sell it in Canada and Amazon US doesn't ship the new ones to Canada so i was forced to buy a used one- although i saved over 100 bucks buy buying the used one.i can't really comment on the battery life because as i said this is used and i don't know the history of this laptop. but the battery life is shorter than my other HP 14 (i only get 4 hours at the most while my other one gets almost double that)
