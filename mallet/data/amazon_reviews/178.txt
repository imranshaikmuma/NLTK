Absolutely love this camera. It had been many years since I had a really nice camera - actually my last one was a film camera. I was looking for a solid and somewhat budget-friendly DSLR that would handle photos and video. Heard so many good things about this I took a chance and must say it has really paid off. It's really a fairly easy camera to learn. If you're a total photog novice it might take some playing with but there are tons of YouTube and other videos out there that help. Not too heavy. Comes with a great lens. Feels good and works great.What I like:PriceEasy of use.Easy to learnLots of extrasVideo quality is excellent.Feels goodRecommend!
