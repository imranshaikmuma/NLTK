We took the new camera on a recent Caribbean cruise.  The photos are sharp and the color excellent.  Even photos taken in low light conditions are superb.  Photos taken in sports mode are blur free; as good as our Canon EOS Rebel.  Image stabilization is better than any camera we own.  The 35X optical zoom works flawlessly even when shooting video.  Videos are clear.The use of flash deserves special mention.  The camera will flash only when the flash is manually raised. This is a great feature because it allows low light shots without going to the menus.The controls and menus are straight forward and easy to use.Battery life is incredible:  300+ shots with a mixture of flash and non-flash.The only negative is that the Canon SX40 HS is that it is a bit bulky.  But when you consider that photos are equal to our Canon EOS Rebel which is far bulkier and requires multiple lenses to get the same zoom range the slight bulkiness is okay.
