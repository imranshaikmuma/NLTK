He loves the fit.  He's an older gentleman with a large tummy but no butt to speak of (where did it go?!).  With other jeans the manufacturers seem to think if you have a large waist you must also have a big butt.  So you end up with jeans that fit at the waist but with enough extra fabric at the hips so make a sail.  Seriously they flap in the wind.  These Lee jeans fit his waist and his hips with no extra fabric.He also likes that there is just the right number of belt loops.  If there aren't enough loops or if they aren't spaced correctly the belt slides up and rubs on bare skin.There was no shrinkage after washing in warm water and drying on medium heat.
