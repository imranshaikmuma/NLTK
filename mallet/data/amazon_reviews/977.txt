I have only started using my phone 2 days ago...so far the experience is greatI live in the Caribbean(Barbados) and I had no issues with the sim cards...was able to make calls as soon as the phone was set up. For music lovers like me don't go looking for media as with other Samsungs....it's not there...the phone uses a Google music appPhone is carrying Android lollipop version and so far it's moving quick and smoothlyThe phone comes with a 13mp back camera but I have not been able to test the camera quality as yet... I took one selfie with the front camera at night an it came out pretty niceThe phone was delivered in the time frame it was supposed to and I had no issues with the sellerAll in all...so far I'm enjoying the Samsung Galaxy J5 experience
