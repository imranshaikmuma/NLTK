The SL 1 is a less expensive alternative to some of the mirror-less fixed lens cameras that have become so popular. With its APS-C sensor and 18 megapixel resolution it is adequate for most ordinary shooting situations. It appealed to me because my kit is all Canon and my current lens fit on it. Coupled with my 40mm pancake lens (one of these days I'll get a wider lens) it has become my walking around camera when I don't  want to lug my 5D around. Some people have complained that its small size makes it somewhat awkward to use but I haven't found that to be a problem.
