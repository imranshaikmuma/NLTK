I would give this jacket a 10/10! I am 6' tall with long arms and a long torso. I ordered an XL so I would be comfy with a long sleeve under it for winter. The size is great! Super long sleeves perfect torso length the zipper is sooo much better than the tacky buttons or snaps and the pockets are in the perfect spots. I will be ordering more!
