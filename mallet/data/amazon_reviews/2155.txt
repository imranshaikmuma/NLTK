very good for the price but it is NOT 2.9 ghz cpu speed or at least not the one i got i got only 2.2ghz max and if u think ur getting 6 full gb of ram is only 4 usable 1gb dedicated for graphics. but over all it is awesome for 300 bucks runs overwatch on low settings 20-33 fps and World of Warcraft at 50+fps on fair settings.
