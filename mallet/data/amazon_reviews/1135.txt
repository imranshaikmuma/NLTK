I love these beanies!! I ordered three of them: black burgundy and copper. I wear all three of them frequently. They have the perfect amount of slouch and are very comfortable and versatile. The cable knit sets them apart from other beanies and gives them a more fashionable look. I will probably end up buying a couple more!
