I bought this camera in a hurry after my Olympus OM-D E-M10 broke just before a vacation to India. I could not have made a better choice. First and most important to me image quality of this little camera is amazing. Using the automatic settings it accurately chooses the right focal points exposure resulting in vibrant-colored images. Manual modes are there as well and although they are not as easily controlled as a larger camera they are adequate. One of the best surprises of this camera was the zoom - which is a real tele zoom allowing for some amazing shots of wildlife etc. Low light exposures come out well there is little noise at higher iso settings. Personally I feel the red color is a bit too vibrant but that is easily helped. Camera size is very small and the battery lasts for many exposures. The only negative is maybe the viewfinder which requires two steps to deploy and is fairly hard to use for someone with glasses (I wear glasses and used it regularly but I think I can't see the whole viewfinder due to the extra distance). I used the USB port to charge the camera on the road and it requires a good overnight charge to be completely full.When I received my Olympus back I had to get used to it after using the Sony so intensely and for a while I wasn't sure if I wanted to go back. Of course they are very different cameras but since I travel a lot there have since been many situations where I would have preferred to the smaller Sony despite the lack of pro-style exchangeable lenses.Overall if you are looking for a very compact camera for many different situations (like a vacation) this is an excellent choice.
