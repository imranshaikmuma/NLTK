I went by the sizes in the product description and ordered a medium since I am a female with a size 8 shoe. When I received them I noticed the sizing on the product was different: according to the company I should've ordered a small.  They seemed ok when I put them on so I thought it would still work - it was just half a size off right? I wore them for the first time this morning when I ran 5.5 miles and I felt like I had two blisters coming up on my toes. The only thing I can think of is that they're slightly big so they were rubbing more than they would normally.  They seem to be great socks though and I might consider ordering a small next time.  Just wanted everyone to be aware.
