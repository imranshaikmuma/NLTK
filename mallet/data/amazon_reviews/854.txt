Great phone! The phone was created to compete with the top phones such as the S7 and Pixel and in my opinion it does it quite well! It looks great and like most phones the performance is not lacking but where it really shines is the camera! I was able to compare with friends taking pictures in various settings such as snowboarding and this one shines with its optical image stabilization and laser focus.
