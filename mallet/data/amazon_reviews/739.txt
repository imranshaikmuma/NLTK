This item was supposed to be new or should i say new like condition. My first look i knew something is not right. The box itself looked different then the original iphone box. Next the Sealed pack was done somewhere in a shop or garage at home on the back of the box its say 16gb and at the bottom its say 64gb. I still opened the pack did have 64bg iphone in the box which look like it was used maybe not for long or who ever used this phone was very careful not to have any Scratch or had a good case or Repaired at some point. The lighting connector had a scratch on the left side.I placed an order on 06/07/2015 and received on 06/10/2015 and Filed for return within 15mins i got it from fedex.
