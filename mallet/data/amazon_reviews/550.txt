I have been using the ISmartalarm System (Preferred Pkg) for a couple years now. Love it !!!I love the fact that I can remotely monitor my home without monthly fees. I added a couple of iSmartalarm KEEP cameras for monitoring large open areas. I get such piece of mind from a quick visual of the house when away. Why the Spot ?  I have a mechanical room that contains a Geothermal system. There is a PSI gauge that needs to stay above a certain psi. When away my son volunteered to stop by and monitor the gauge. A hassle for him. Then I read about the Spot - perfect solution !!! I ordered a smart switch along with the Spot. Now I can turn on a lamp in the mechanical room remotely and visually monitor the psi gauge to get a status. I can then take action only when I need to. Perfect solution for me.
