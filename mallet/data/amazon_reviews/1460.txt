I am 5'6" 120 pounds with a very lean frame. I purchased a size Small. The scrub top fit very well on my slender frame and I still had room to spare. The material feels sturdy (not soft though) so I feel protected from accidents and spills. I also purchased a size small for the same brand of scrub pants but they did run a little long for me. I'll have to wear taller tennis shoes and tie my pants very tightly otherwise they might drag on the floor.
