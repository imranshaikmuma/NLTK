This top fits as expected.  Unfortunately for me I am 5'11''.  And very thin.  So I ordered the small per the measurement chart and it fits perfect through the shoulders bust sleeve length etc.  It is just short for me. It measures 15 inches underarm-to-waist 25 inches shoulder-to-waist.  It hits me just at the top of my hips.  So when I lift my arms you can see my midsection.I tried ordering the "tall" size from a different company but that was HUGE like a dress!  My quest for a good scrub top that fits me continues.However if you're of average torso length I am sure this will be a great fit for you.The pockets are really nice they have helpful little details to help keep you organized.  The material feels good not too thin or scratchy. This was a good purchase at a great price!
