It seems that most of these unlocked international version phones are unlocked by the sellers themselves who break the phone's box seal open the box and unlock the phones themselves (note that Samsung says "do not accept if seal is broken"). Hence technically most of these unlocked international version phones are not really new. I bought a lot of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phones from Amazon and most (not all) had the seal broken.On the phone itself this is the best phone I have ever tried. Slick light balanced fantastic screen fast water proof and so on .... its only caveat (and an important one) is the lack of removable battery (Samsung lost the removable batter starting with the S6). I like this phone much better than the Edge. The S7 Edge has a bigger screen but the resolution is the same as with the S7 and its edges are highly annoying making one touch them by mistake constantly. Furthermore the Edge's edges make it very difficult to properly protect the phone with a case - not a problem with the regular S7.Finally the only difference between the G930F (single sim version) and the G930FD (dual sim version) is that in the latter the slot where the micro card goes is also enabled to accept a second sim card which is recognized by the device's OS.
