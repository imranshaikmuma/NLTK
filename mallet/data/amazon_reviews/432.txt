Great long zoom camera that fits in your jean pocket!  Amazing! Sony has done it again. Before this pocket camera I would use my iPhone in situations where I did not want carry or shoot a larger camera.  Of course in low light the iPhone photos weren't great particularly when I tried to zoom in in the subject such as a Congressman at a political celebration.  With this camera I was able to get long zooms in low light that came out surprisingly well.  It's never going to match a long zoom full format camera but those are 4 to 5 times the size of this camera.  This camera is a real winner and makes taking a great camera with you anywhere so much easier.
