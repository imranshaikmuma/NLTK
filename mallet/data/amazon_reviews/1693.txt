I just bought it for lab because someone stole my lab coat. My first lab coat was bought from the school bookstore which is very overpriced. I bought my first lab coat for 36 dollars. This was a great deal and shipped fast. I am happy with this purchase. I bought it small but I'm a pretty petite figure a girl. And it is a bit large. I have to roll up the sleeves. But i like that it covers all my body and that it keeps me warm in the lab! haha. I am happy with this purchase
