I purchased this phone because I was going to be visiting Montreal QC and my primary phone doesn't work there.  I researched a simple unlocked phone compatible with networks outside the US and came across the BLU Tank.  Based on the description I should have been able to purchase and install a SIM card for any GSM carrier to use the phone.My local friend took me to a mall with several cell phone kiosks and shops.  One by one they scanned the phone's barcode or looked up the serial number and determined that the phone was incompatible.  Virgin Mobile Koodo Fido and Rogers at the mall.  I later found out Virgin uses AT&T's network and Koodo uses Telus.  AT&T and Telus are CDMA networks in Canada so that's on me.  But Fido uses Rogers network which is GSM.  Even the Rogers shop itself told me the phone was incompatible with their network.I next tried a Best Buy.  Their prepaid service in Canada is Chatr which is also through Rogers and so its a GSM network.  In true Best Buy fashion they ended up presenting me with a Catch-22.  They said they couldn't determine if the BLU Tank was compatible with Chatr unless it was activated.  But they couldn't activate it unless I purchased a SIM card and minutes.  I wasn't about to buy something that the store didn't even know would be compatible so I left.Perhaps there's a carrier somewhere in Montreal that would have worked with this phone but I didn't find it.  This phone is advertised for international use and compatibility yet it doesn't seem to work with any GSM networks.In terms of hardware its a simple design and looks like it would have been worth the price if I had gotten it activated.  If you plan on traveling with this phone I guess you should expect to spend a day calling major wireless providers at your destination to determine compatibility.
