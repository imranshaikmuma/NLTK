My only complaint and it is a big one is the keyboard.  The right-hand shift key has been made smaller for some reason.  Anyone who knows how to type will have problems with this.  You will be forced to look down every time you need to use the right-handed shift to capitalize letters or use symbols.  The design of the body makes it impossible to replace the keyboard to correct this problem.
