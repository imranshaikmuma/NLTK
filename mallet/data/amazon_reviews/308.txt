Originally owned the Theta M and decided to upgrade to this unit for the HD capability.  The Theta S is a good improvement but not enough to warrant the upgrade if you own the previous model.Pros:  Good build quality excellent panoramic stitching capability decent battery life (5-6 hours) and easy connectivity to a mobile device.  Easy to use and allows anyone to create great panoramic imageryCons: Image quality is lacking even though they claim it's HD.  The best image quality is achieved with optimal lighting or outdoor environments.  Video quality is acceptable but a bit laggy and occasionally skips.  I would not recommend for 360Â° video capture.
