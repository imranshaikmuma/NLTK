I originally bought this camera five months ago to replace a stolen Canon PowerShot SX230 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 14x Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Blue). In those five months this camera has not let me down at all.First of all it takes very high quality images for a non-SLR which you should be able to see from all the sample images laying around this site and elsewhere. It's also very ergonomic and feels very comfortable to hold. My two favorite things about the physical design are the zoom lever and the flip-out rotating LCD screen. The control dial is very nice too and operates smoothly. Also the mode dial can rotate infinitely meaning you can continue to turn it after reaching the last notch instead of having to turn it in reverse to get back to the first selection. There is also a fully customizable self-timer option on the dial which can really come in handy.The in-camera controls are very intuitive. For most users the Auto and Scene modes will speak for themselves and get the job done very well with minimal controls for the user to deal with. Those who prefer to shoot in Manual mode and/or dive deep into the main menu will be delighted at the many options and customizations available. There are so many options to choose from and the menu is easy to navigate.Lastly the zoom is excellent. 35x may be a bit excessive for most occasions but the option is there and the results it produces are great. All in all this camera doesn't really have any flaws I can think of that would warrant anything less than a full five-star rating.
