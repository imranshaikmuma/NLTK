I have always loved the Koi Lindsey Cargo scrubs. When I first started where I work now I bought 6 pairs in the XL size. Overtime I gained weight and they didn't fit anymore. I searched endlessly for them in a XXL and tall (which are fairly hard to come by). I found this pair and was so excited! I received them in the mail today and the length is perfect. I am six foot tall and the problem with scrubs is when I sit and squat the rise up like high-water capris and I hate that! I am a larger individual (usually wear a size 20 pant) so the waist and butt is a little tight but the legs are perfect! I will say that with the white ones they are a little see-through so don't wear any dark underwear! I look forward to purchasing more!
