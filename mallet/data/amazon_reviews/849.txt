Last summer I broke my Samsung Galaxy S5. At that time I bought a BLU Advanced 5.0 for $59.00 (Terrible phone). I needed an upgrade but I didn't want to get stuck in AT&T monthly purchase plan for a new phone. I did some research and saw this phone. I have been a fan of ASUS Computers. I ordered it through Prime at 8 pm. It came by noon the next day! I love you Amazon!. Anyways the phone was impressive right out the the box. It looks so sleek and thin. In the box; Charger phone SIM card tool and instructions in a few languages. I stuck my AT&T SIM card and my MicroSD card in and fired it up. I am not a tech expert. It walks you through set up so nicely when you get started. Within 5 mins I had a fully set up phone. It even will install apps from your old phone automatically if you wish (I have no idea if that is common but its nice).  The phone is responsive and fast. The touch screen is sensitive in a good way. I love the fingerprint unlocking feature. It also lets you set up other apps to have it log in with your fingerprint. I was able to set up my banking app login in with a fingerprint (instead of my normal password) How cool is that!? The camera seems good so far. I just snapped a few pics around the house. It does focus and snap very quickly. The Screen is bigger than I expected when I ordered it. It looks really nice.  There are a few ASUS apps that I can't imaging wanting that come on the phone but not a big deal. The ASUS User Interface seems simple and logical.  Overall for $200 the phone is a great alternative to walking into a store and laying down $600. I also think its better than buying a used/refurbished phone.
