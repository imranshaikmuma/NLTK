Welcome to the club.  If you’re the sort of MAN that mows his own lawn would rescue children from a burning orphanage then change the oil on a car truck or train; then this is the shirt for you.Dickies are some of the longest and hardest wearing shirts in the history of MEN.  The design allows one the wear them tucked in or hanging out.  Long sleeves can be rolled up and you’ve got a delightful summer ensemble to carry you through the year; just the way I like it.  There are also two pockets count them two which hold manly man things like chuck keys fishing lures and bacon.With more than a dozen colors who’s to say these aren’t equally fashionable?  With so many choices you can have a shirt to match your mood.  Silver when the Raiders play at home Hunter Green for hunting and Red as a display of rage over the senseless removal of Caterpillar engines from the pickup truck market.  There truly is a color for every occasion.Washing is idiot proof since I can do it.  Put it in the machine and wash no pre-rinse or delicate cycles just get the washer started and you did good.  Then you can dry by hanging it up using the dryer or leaving it in the machine for an extra day cuz it will come out fresh and wrinkle free.If you’re seeking the ultimate work shirt it really is hard to do better than Dickies.  Having them delivered to my doorstep and avoiding a soul depleting trip to a mall makes it a done deal.
