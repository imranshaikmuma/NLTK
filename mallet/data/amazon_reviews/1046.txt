I bought a pair of these firstly in a store and now I'm obsessed with buying them on Amazon. I ordered one pair of the "peach skin/brushed fabric" ones and they're better for lounging than working out they feel soft like thin fleece not the best for wicking away sweat.The other pairs are the normal or what they list as "silky" material and I love them for running everything stays in place. For lifting I'm not just sitting in my own sweat it's great. And they come in so many colors I've got four pairs at home and two on the way. I used to be a loyal Under Armour customer but I can get three pairs of these for the same price as one UA pair. It's safe to say I've found my new favorite.I work out 5 times a week I'm 5'6" tall 130 pounds and the small size fits me pretty well.
