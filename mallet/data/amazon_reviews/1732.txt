I love it currently.  Nice tight fit.  I'm 6'0 at 150lb or so.  It actually was just a little smaller / shorter than i expected out of a medium especially not being washed yet. So anyone who normally has to go a size up this is a good example of doing so here.Not being cotton this should fit me quite awhile even after a few washes.
