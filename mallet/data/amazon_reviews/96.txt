I haven't been disappointed a bit by the camera which joins two D810s and a Sony A6300 in the collection.  I bought the camera FOR the crop to get some extra apparent distance from my longer lenses got fast moving sports and for the occasion BIF.  I brought it with me from the US to the UK to put it through its paces.  So far focus acquit ion has been super fast. Buffer and buffer depth allow me to shoot 30-40 raws without the buffer filling.  While some have reported miscellaneous problems the QA on ine has been superb.  I use Lexar 2933x XQD cards and either Lexar UHSII 2000x or Sandisk 280 Mbit/sec cards.  I don't miss the flash; throw on an nexpensive SB500 and away you go.  I've now shot about 1500 images and while not all are keepers the number of potential keepers is high.  Great autofus system.  Highly recommended.  It is NOT full frame and don't buy it expecting full-frame.  Expect some of this technology to show up in the replacement for the D810.
