I made the switch from Nikon (D3100) to Canon about one year ago. I started using DSLR's mainly for videos on YouTube and dabbling in photography. Although I would say my Nikon was more user friendly for beginners- settings wise this was definitely the step up I needed. The main reason for making the switch was to find a camera that worked best for a one man show. The Canon 70D does everything for me and makes it that much easier. It's fast auto focus makes it easy to just hit record and start my video. I never have to ask myself "am I in focus?" or find myself surprised when I upload the footage into Sony Vegas. The flip out screen also helps in framing the shot by myself. Overall I upgraded to make my life easier when it came to filming and it did just that. If you are purchasing this camera for beginner photography I always recommend the T6i's to get to know the basics. But if you're willing to splurge a little I say hey why not. I love how quick the camera is in shooting photos and I never have to feel like i'm missing a shot. The LCD screen is also seamless and is very true to color.
