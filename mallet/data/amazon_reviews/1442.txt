Good day! I hope this review can help at least one person decide whether or not to try these. I'm not sure if it's due to the comfort waist feature but I would say these pants run on the large size. If Amazon still has free returns you may want to order a couple of sizes to be sure you get the best fit. These pants are ready to go right out of the dryer. No they don't have a razor sharp crease but they look perfectly acceptable for the office or weekend. I wear them to work all the time without ironing and they look just fine. If you are particular about having a crease you may want to touch them up with the iron. The comfort waist is a definite plus when you are between size or just had that extra large client lunch. The color is right on and the description is perfectly accurate. A side note I always have to have my slacks hemmed as I am very short. I just ordered these in a 30" inseam and brought them to the tailor to shorten without incident and they look like they came that way. I would recommend these to any man in the market for new slacks - father son brother friend etc. I am almost positive they would like the pants and I'd bet they don't go back to regular waist pants after trying the comfort waist. Just one person's opinion your mileage may vary. Enjoy your new pants!
