I bought this phone on January 2 It arrived 3-4 weeks later (as everything I order from amazon I am in Honduras). As I received it the headphone jack was not working when I plugged in the headphones the sound was very bad quality I am not even able to enjoy a song (which is really important to me) but the sound that comes out of the iphone is good quality just not able to listen through the headphone jack. The phone has always been in a lifeproof phone case it has never been drop I have not submerged into water and it is new. I was going to let go of the sound problem even though I was dissappointed; but on saturday the touch started giving me problems. Yesterday (sunday) I was not able to use my phone at all  even though I restarted the phone several times to see if that would help but it did not; even if it did work it would not last for more than 15 seconds. I left the phone alone for the rest of the day and today I turned it on the touch works when it wants to (and if it does it just last for some minutes if lucky) and stops whenever it decides. Right now I am not beeing able to use it.I got to the conclusion that the phone came with failures and maybe it is just  my bad luck and the rest of the phones came out good but I really would like to know if there is something I could do about it because honestly I do really need it and in this condition it is just a waste of money. Please contact me if you think I could send the phone back and get another that works properly.Thanks and bye!
