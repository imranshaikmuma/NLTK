My interpretation of this shirt in Jade is that it is a greenish turquoise rather than a yellowish green that you find in some jade.  To give you a visual my turquoise necklace harmonized with color or this shirt and I have a jade necklace which clashed with it because it looked more green.  Therefore the color is a little more bluish than in the picture on the product page on Amazon which was a nice surprise because I like that color better.  Also I usually wear a Small or X-Small top and ordered the Small which was very roomy.  I am glad I did not size up as some reviews had suggested.  It had no wrinkles after I washed it by hand and drip dried.  Not sure how long the fabric will hold up it is somewhat thin and I would imagine a lighter color in this shirt would be more see through but this one is not.  I like it so much that I plan to order two more colors.
