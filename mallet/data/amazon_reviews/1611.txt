Update: These do run much longer on the inseam before you wash and dry them. After drying these may be about 1/2" - 3/4" longer than other carhartts. I found this out the hard way with returning the original 34x32 and ordering 2 pairs of 34x30 and washing only to find out they turned into high waters for me. I ended up buying another 2 pairs of 34x32 and washed and it ended up at abluttle longer length but That didn't bother me much.Made in the USA! These Carhartt pants run longer than their regular canvas pants but those all fit differently depending on where they are made. I normally wear 34x32 in other Carhartts but these I had to return to get 34x30. I purchased these in black moss and gravel and all fit the same.
