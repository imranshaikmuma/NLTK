i found these serendipitously looking for work pants with pockets on both sides these are hands down the most comfortable pants i have ever had they are like super soft almost like lounge pants  feel like velour  soooo comfy beats the hell out of work jeans or those tough and rough cotton duck  im telling you buy these and you will never want to wear jeans again they are awesome and look really good too. i have the green and dark coffee i like the dark coffee better. think  i will try some blue ones now.. im ordering more... my jeans can sit in the closet . o im all about the comfort they are so much warmer than jeans to me also. but not hot just feel like you could sleep in them  hell ive fell asleep in the recliner with them all ready dont understand why more people havent heard of them if you like functional comfortable and tough  these will be all you want to wear. i just ordered more so i dont have to work in anything else.. color me spoiled.
