This lace sleepwear / lingerie is cute but not quite as pictured. The color is not as vibrant as pictured and is two toned ( lace halter and mesh sheer tunic ) The lace is sturdy and is nice because the straps are criss-cross which strongly holds "you" up. The panties are super cute but small and not true to size. The tops fits great -  I wear a 36 D bra and I ordered a L which fits fine and I wear  L panties but these are more of a small so the two aren't proportioned accurately. I will be unfortunately returning because of the two tone to the top and small bottoms.
