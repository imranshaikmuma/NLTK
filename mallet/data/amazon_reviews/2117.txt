Not a bad review of Amazon but I think Apple has some explaining to do.  I am already experiencing "graphics" issues where I get flickering pixelation and discoloration. Pretty sloppy for such a luxury item in my opinion thankfully Apple care is in effect but buyers beware this is an issue do your research. Just searching the new MacBook Pro with touch bar will not lead you to the known issues you literally have to search "display issues".
