I got this phone for my 12 year old daughter whose phone broke and I did not want to pay 200 for a deductible for a new one. I will just list pros and cons to make it easierPros:does not look cheapdecent sizecan get multiple apps as long as u get additional storageCamera is ok for the priceVery stylishCons:Opening it is an hassleHow to insert the sim card gets on my nerves and was confusinglack of directions gives you a headacheoverall for $50.00 the phone is definitely worth it. Now this is for my 12 year old. I would not buy the phone for myself unless I was on an extreme budget and needed something and I am 30. I asked my daughter for the review and she says that she loves it and is happy that I got it. I would definitely recommend buying a case and additional storage.
