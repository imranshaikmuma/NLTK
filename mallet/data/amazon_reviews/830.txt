I am a recent iPhone convert. I have worked in the mobile industry for years and always look for a phone that will give me bang for my buck. This phone completely fits the bill. The display is crisp the photo quality is excellent the ability to add memory invaluable. It does lag sometimes but not so bad that I'm ready to throw it out the window. I love the fingerprint sensor by the time my phones at my face it's unlocked and ready to go. The FM radio is a great bonus too. I just received it yesterday and am activating it on AT&T's prepaid plan. I'm looking forward to seeing how the phone's service runs - I'm sure I'll be pleasantly surprised.
