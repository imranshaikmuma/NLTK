Bluetooth connectivity is not as described nor is wifi. It is cheap and really annoying product. I am returning it. I got this so I could easily use my iPhone as a remote... not easily done. I cannot get the camera to get to my phone Nikon website does not address questions I have. What a shame. My Nikon 1 J3 is archived but that was a great little camera and I will continue using it.
