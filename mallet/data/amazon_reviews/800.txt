I brought this phone because I was going to the Caribbeans and needed basic a phone that took a sim card that I could use there. I did not drop or damage the phone. On the 3 day of use the phone started to turn itself on and off draining the battery kept asking if I wanted to turn it off and when I said yes it turned off and back on.  I even tried taking the battery out reset phone it did not work.  I went online to see if i was doing something wrong only thing I came up with was complaints of the same thing.  I wish i had read up on it before purchase. So beware.
