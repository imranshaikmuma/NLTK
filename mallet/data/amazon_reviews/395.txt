Best camera I've ever owned! Does a great job on pictures though I'm no photographer. I really like the picture quality but this little thing shines on the video end. Nice and crisp videos and with the picture stabilization it is wonderful.I'm still learning about it so haven't gone through all the paces. Last camera I had was a Sony cybershot and I always hated it. Took forever for the shutter to engage after I pushed the button and I missed shots all the time. This takes the picture when I want to not when it wants to.Best part by far is the true point and shoot set up. I don't understand all the technical stuff and wanted something I could point and shoot period.
