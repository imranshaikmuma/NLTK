I ordered 2 of these jackets: one in Medium and one in Large. I am 5'6 and am a size 10 but can range from an 8-12 depending on brand of clothing. I wasn't sure which size to get after reading such varying reviews so I got both sizes but in different colors in case I liked them both.  Both jackets fit but had some minor noticeable differences.  The Medium was more fitted and had less give in the front waist and hips when zipping up. I can comfortably wear t-shirts and tank tops under the Medium. It was also more figure flattering. The Large had more room all over when zipping and I can comfortably wear it over a long sleeve shirt or sweatshirt. This one is great for layering but the look and feel are more loose; however I am definitely not swimming in it as other reviews have said. I am keeping both because they wash well are comfortable and are great for different purposes. Both arm lengths seemed pretty even and roomy especially considering they have the elastic wrists. So in summary if you are not sure what size to get or are in between sizes the smaller size will be more fitted with a flattering look and the larger size will offer more room and options for layering.
