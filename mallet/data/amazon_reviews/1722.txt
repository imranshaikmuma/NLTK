Where to begin with this...well for starters it was shipped decently fast and arrived on time which was nice. And I was a little nervous ordering this from the other reviews that I read saying that it wasn't all that great but I did it anyways cause you know it was only 10 bucks and change.When I got it I noticed the light tan color that is shown in the picture is not what it looks like at all! it's actually a brown which doesn't match my ACU camo pants for airsoft which kind of made me sad. But I am going to wash it and hope that the brown color fades out to a lighter color so it matches better.As for the fit it is fairly slimming and not all that thick. This wouldn't do much against a bb or a paintball. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone for camo. I'm going to post a picture so you can we the colors.
