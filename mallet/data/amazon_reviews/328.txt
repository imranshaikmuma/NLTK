As a bicycle tourer and enthusiastic point and shoot amateur photographer I look for maximum performance in the smallest package. I found that in the Canon PowerShot SX720 HS. It is a little bigger and heavier than other compact digital cameras but the advantages you get from it easily make up for this. Between this camera and my iPhone I am as compact as possible. I can capture quality images wirelessly transfer them with the Canon Connect app to my phone and then send them to family and friends. The fantastic zoom gives me the ability to reach out and grab the shots which were not possible with my previous camera. The Super Vivid mode can turn a boring dim sunset into a print you are proud to show to others. I almost feel guilty when I receive compliments on the photos as the camera did it not me.
