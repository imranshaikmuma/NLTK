We got a lemon.  We bought the camera the end of January and it stopped powering on at the end of March.  We contacted Sony and were told to send to a repair place 900 miles away - at our expense (over $12.00!).  We received it back.  It worked for 1 picture and then had the exact same problem.  I contacted Sony again.  They wanted me to send it back to the same place that couldn't fix it to begin with!  They kept referring me to another rep who would then call back and repeat the same line - send it back to the repair place.  I wanted a new camera this place obviously didn't know what they were doing and it should not have gone bad after 2 months of limited use.  I finally resorted to facebook and was told they would call this afternoon.  They did - and gave the same response!  What did they not understand??  I have talked to over a half dozen people about this and never got any satisfaction.  You would think they would just replace the camera and be done with it.  Thankfully Amazon has offered to accept this return.  We will not replace it with a Sony (which has increased $20 since we bought it in January) because the true test of a company is not in the sale but in handling problems.  Sony failed big time in that department. It's unfortunate because it was decent camera the few times it worked...
