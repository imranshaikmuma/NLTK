My waist is 34.  Large fits snugly but not too tight.  Legs stayed in place and did not ride up.  Fabric is slick and somewhat shiny reminiscent of 90's biker shorts but w/o any padding.  The seams are stitched well and do not rub or scratch the skin.  There is no fly.  Would prefer a slightly wider waist band elastic strip to prevent it folding over when bending over (probably not a problem if my stomach was flatter).  It appears that a compression baselayer short is in reality nice looking underwear.  Does show off quads nicely but this fact is not apparently appreciated by everyone.  You'd think a package liquor store wouldn't be so judgy about dresscodes but they thought compression baselayer shorts were underwear too.  Ah well...they look nice keep everything cool and dry whether you wear pants or not.
