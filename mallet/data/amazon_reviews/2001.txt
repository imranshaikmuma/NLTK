I bought this laptop to bring to my school's library when I have work to do and when I don't have work to do (nudge nudge I play games in school). The screen is great the backlit keyboard is absolutely WONDERFUL and the computer can run almost all games very well. It can even run XCOM 2 pretty well at medium settings which is great. I love this computer.
