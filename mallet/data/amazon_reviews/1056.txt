I love this shirt.  I'm a size 14-16 on top so I bought the XXL.  The size I ordered was perfect.  Not too large at the arms it flows comfortably around my waist area.  The material is cool to touch and soft.  It drooped at the neck area just right as it showed just enough cleavage without having to be adjusted when bending over.  If I wanted a tighter fit I could probably order a size smaller.  I've worn this at my job with casual trousers with my jeans.  and with a casual long skirt.  It worked for all looks.  The color is nice as well.  It's an all around great top.
