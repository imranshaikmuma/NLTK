Lol this was pretty ridiculous. It has a ton of almost use able features. None of the apps you are supposed to download actually works with it (used 3 different phones). It will however Bluetooth sync with your phone take calls pictures play music (not bad for the tiny little speaker) and give you a general idea whether or not you should splurge on a super expensive name brand smart watch. Cool gadget to give to a kid to play with and have a "smartwatch" of their own without worry about spending an arm and a leg.
