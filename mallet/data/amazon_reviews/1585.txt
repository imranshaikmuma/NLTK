These are such great quality pants very soft and have an inner layer too. My 2 year old (who is short but chubby for his age) wore the size 3 for the first time today and they were a little too big but I haven't washed them yet and expect they'll shrink a little and he'll grow into them as well. Would still buy a size 3 I also ordered in another color too.
