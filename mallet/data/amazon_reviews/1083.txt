I was disappointed in these leggings. The price and texture of the fabric are great and the variety of different prints are a lot of fun but the fabric is far too thin - they are more like tights instead of leggings and they provide no support. Leggings should feel tight and substantial - these feel flimsy and will probably rip the moment you sit down. As for sizing: I am 5'6" 125 lbs 28" waist and 38" hips. I have very slender but long legs and most skinny jeans are loose around my ankles. I did not have a problem with length but these leggings were far too big in the ankles and knees for me (1 - 2" extra fabric in these areas). If you are looking for a cheap pair of leggings to wear once or twice got for it; but if you are looking for a wardrobe staple keep looking.
