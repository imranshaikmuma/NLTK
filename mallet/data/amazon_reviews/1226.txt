I love these liners! They stay in place better than others I have purchased the small tab on the heel does it's job very well. With the shoes I wear them with you can't see them at all. I wear a size 10 and sometimes 11 in women's shoes and I purchase the size 8-12. They fit perfect and are really stretchy and comfortable. I've bought other ones that fit but would feel really uncomfortable on my toes after wearing them for half a day. The material feels soft and after washing them and even putting them in the dryer they didn't shrink or become too tight! The price for these is also more than reasonable I've seem some that were $7 for one pair! These are the best I've ever had and you get 6 pairs for $13 you can't beat it! Fantastic purchase I am so happy!
