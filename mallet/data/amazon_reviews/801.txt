I would not recommend this phone if you attend to use it as a daily phone with all it's features on especially if you want to use WIFI calling versus cellular service such as in your home or work.I purchased this phone as a replacement to a landline phone with not using the phone (sitting on a counter) and WIFI and Data Transfer on I get about 12-14 hours of battery time. Per the manufacture if you turn off WIFI and Data Transfer you will get longer battery usage.
