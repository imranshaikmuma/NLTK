Best Android ever. Would honestly choose this over any flagship Android or iPhone. Exemplifies the reason I chose Android over iPhone for is above exceptional performance. This isn't one of those cheap high quality looking Android phones that break down in a month. This is next to pure Android OS with tons of goodies in the new Android N update that makes having an iPhone a thing of the past. Honestly try it out and you won't regret it
