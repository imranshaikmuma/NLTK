Carhartt jackets are the best for a lot of reasons. I wouldn't consider them highly fashionable but they do have a nice styling and are very recognizable. They are made of strong materials and are warm enough for my local midwest winters. These jackets are very stiff when they're new and can take months or even a whole winter to loosen up. To me that just means it will last a very long time.The fit: these jackets fit slightly large even compared to other coats and jackets which are supposed to be larger than shirts etc. However they are a little on the short side. I am 6'1 and a normal XL fits me well but if you are used to Big&Tall clothes or like a jacket with a little extra length go for the Tall sizing. Sometimes tall sized jackets and shirts can be extremely long like a rapper's white T shirt. I've tried on Tall Carhartt jackets and they are not TOO tall FWIW.Carhartt jackets are truly "buy it for life" items which is becoming more and more rare as we move into an era where everything is disposable. If that is something you appreciate get this one! If you are considering this jacket as a gift: I am a 26 year old guy and I think any young guy would like to have one!!
