Fits well. I use it for Jiu Jitsu although I can see using it for running or any other physical sport where you need compression. It keeps me dry. I am about a 34-36 and I got an XL. It fits well although I feel like I might probably get away with wearing a large. Not sure how much more compression I would get by going down a size but the xl still fits well enough for me to roll/run and not have any issues.
