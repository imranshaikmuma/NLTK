In June I bought Skechers Sport Women's D'Lites Slip-on Mule Sneaker. I ordered a 9.5 because that's my size. These were a little too big but I kept them anyway. I then decided to buy a second pair and ordered a 9 which fit perfectly although with wear Skechers are notorious for stretching in the width way too much. Both pairs did. I want a pair of lace-ups to secure my feet better to walk around the neighborhood in so I ordered these D'Lites Centennial sneakers in a size 9 because of what happened with the others. They arrived and were way too small in length. I returned them and ordered a 9.5 which just arrived and are also too small in length. The left shoe is better fitting but the right feels exactly like the size 9 did! I really love the look of these and I really need a pair of sneakers but do I keep buying and returning for a larger size??? I'm so frustrated I don't know what to do. Why can't Skechers make all their products with the same sizing???? Ugh!
