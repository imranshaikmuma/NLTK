We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the photos. Brought this with us to Disney and used on water rides and in the pool. Camera is nice and sturdy and settings were pretty easy to use. I just wish it had better low light settings. Overall it's a great camera. If you plan to use aggressively throughout the day though would suggest getting an additional battery.
