This is a fantastic camera. I'm an amateur enthusiast and I'm learning a lot on this compact SLR; It's compatible with all of Canon's lenses and my photographer friends are able to teach me on it with their accessories flashes and lenses because of that. It takes amazing 1080p video and with the mic that comes as part of this kit the audio is very clear and loud. The articulating screen which is a touchscreen is intuitive and useful for reviewing photos and for setting up focus for shots and video. I love the wifi feature to transfer photos to my phone quickly. Overall there's nothing more I could ask for in a camera. It's lightweight enough to carry around without issues but sturdy enough to have a substantial feeling in my hands. And the kit lens does a pretty good job even if the zoom is obviously not as far as a longer lens would be. I'm very happy with this camera and satisfied with my investment.
