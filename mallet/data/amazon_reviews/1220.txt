These socks are decent but I also bought the HUE Women's No-Show Low-Cut Sock Liners HUE Women's 4 pair pack Cotton Liner Asst Medium/Large (Size 2) which are better in my opinion because the sticky heel pad is bigger so they stay on your heel better.Photo for reference.  The one with the smaller sticky pad is the PEDS version larger rubber sticky pad is the HUE version.
