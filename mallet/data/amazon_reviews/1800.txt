I was going to purchase a laptop from QVC or HSN because I didn't have the $700-900 that this kind of laptop usually costs. I'd done extensive research for over a month Best Buy online the whole nine. I wanted a laptop with at least 8GB RAM 1TB HD a DVD drive & a backlit keyboard with a touchscreen.Then I found this!! For under $500!!!I was prepared to buy a wi-fi signal booster for speed just in case (I live in a 2 bdrm apt. with a shaky signal at times) but I've had it for 3 weeks with no problems with speed or anything else. It was an easy set-up right out the box. Soo happy & grateful I made this purchase!
