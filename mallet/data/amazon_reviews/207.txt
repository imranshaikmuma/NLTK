I am a hobbyist with a Canon T2i (550) camera and couple of Canon lenses.I always wanted to go for a full-frame camera and finally pulled the trigger on this one. Even though it is expensive - since I don't make any money from this hobby - it is the best investment I made!Things I liked in this camera compared to my T2i -  picture quality shutter sound double card slots with simultaneous raw and jpg capture advanced view finder in-camera hdr micro focus adjustment for lenses etc. There are many reviews on internet for other technical details and features.I found the AF system of this camera takes some time to master and it got many more options and features to learn for a T2i user.Now if you are a user like me don't hesitate to buy this camera as you will like the features and image quality.I am still learning to use this camera and think it will keep me entertained for a while :-)Please note that this camera is heavier and little bigger than Rebel models.I used this camera with my Canon 24-70 2.8 L lens and it can get heavy after 4-5 hours of use :-)Please check and rate my images and reviews.Thanks
