I have the 15" model (Model NP900X5L-K02US). I bought it to replace a 5-year old Macbook Air. I could not be happier.Great display keyboard good selection of ports Boots fast and so far everything has been perfect.Besides being lightweight it is small for a 15" screen (very little extra frame around the screen). It fits perfectly into the Amazon Basics laptop bag for 14" laptops and also in the Amazon Basics sleeve for 14' laptops...with enough room for the AC converter. Obviously the 256 GB SSD is not a lot of storage but with a micro SD slot (along with 2 USB-3 slots and a USB-C slot) it is easy enough to extend the storage.The best laptop I have ever owned.
