I'm a technologically challenged person and I wanted something easy to use and compact that I could travel with and surf the web since this is what I use a computer most for anyway. I love the size and thin design. It was super easy to set up. You do need to set up a google account but that's easy also. I have no dislikes to mention at this time. The only thing I've had some difficulties with is using the keypad since I've been use to a touchscreen but retraining myself hasn't been hard. I would definitely recommend this chromebook to others.
