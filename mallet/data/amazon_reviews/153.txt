The reason I decided to go with a D750 when I already owned the D610 was it's superior tracking ability of moving subjects in well-lit and low light conditions. I shoot a lot of wildlife especially birds in flight and they are not easy subjects to capture. I also enjoy shooting local live bands in very challenging lighting situations and while my D610 was handling these conditions pretty well it did miss a few shots every now and then that I wish I had gotten. Especially when it comes to birds flying toward me at fast speeds the D610 could not always keep up with them. The keeper rate was acceptable but the D750 simply performs better in these situations. I get more keepers plus I get slightly faster FPS which means I get slightly more frames to choose from.In low light where even my eyes struggle to see any contrast there is no contest between the two cameras. The D750 locks on in near darkness whereas the D600/D610 would hunt under the same conditions. As long as there is contrast visible the D610 will do just fine. I've put it through some difficult circumstances and it handled them better than I expected. The D750 however is just more sure of itself. It hunts less it will lock quickly and your results will be impressive.The image quality of the D750 is great of course just as it is when using the D610. Auto white balance works surprisingly well. Skin tones look nice and so does everything else. Highlight-weighed metering is an interesting option and helps to preserve whites that might otherwise be blown out.At first I felt the flip screen wouldn't do me much good as a still photography shooter but now that I have it I do use it to get some odd angles which I wouldn't have gotten otherwise. I'm not always willing to lay on the ground or stand on my tip-toes to get a shot and now I don't have to. The screen is sturdy and hasn't gotten in the way so it seems like a pretty useful feature. Fold it in when not in use bring it out when you need it.Not only does it perform as promised but I have also not experienced any negative issues that may have plagued some past Nikon models. I've shot around 5000 frames with it so far and there are no signs of anything going awry. It focuses fast regardless of light availability and high ISO photos look great especially when processed through Lightroom. Basically if you're looking for an action DSLR with lots of great features for a reasonable price the D750 will fit you well.-----------------UPDATE: (Some people have reported seeing a shadow band at the top of the frame when shooting flares at specific angles. I have not seen this problem with my D750 but Nikon issued an advisory to repair it for free if you happen to see it. Most have not encountered this problem during normal shooting only when they intentionally tried to induce this shadow band. If you like to shoot flares or if you shoot a lot of video you may want to check your body for the problem when you buy it. Personally I don't think this is as big of a problem as oil spots on sensor or left focusing issue but there are a few buyers out there who might be affected by it. Personally I have not seen this problem with three different D750 bodies I used but some others might.)-----------------IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER TO DSLR PHOTOGRAPHY...and you haven't really handled a DSLR before the D750 may be a lot of camera and it may be intimidating with all the buttons menus and dials but it does also have an "Auto" mode with some scene modes available that will get you through the first phase of learning how to operate it. I recommend you buy a comprehensive Nikon D750 guide book and use that instead of the Nikon-provided manual. The manual that comes with the camera is far too confusing and it doesn't really teach you anything about DSLR photography. All it does is explain what each function does which is sometimes not enough to make you understand why you need to do something a certain way. Auto and scene modes are nice but if you're buying a camera of this caliber you want to be able to benefit from what it offers which is amazing images when the correct settings are used. Get out of Auto mode and explore M A P and S. You'll be happy you did.IF YOU'RE A NIKON DX SHOOTER...thinking about moving to full frame you currently have three choices at the 24 megapixel low to mid-range price; D600 D610 and D750. The D600 D610 and D750 are all pretty good choices but your decision will heavily depend on how you're going to use the camera and how big of a budget you have.Here are the similarities between them:- They all have 1/4000s max shutter speed.- They all have very similar button controls (the D750 buttons on the left side are a little bit different by including the "i" for info button)- All three have a magnificent 24 megapixel sensor with plenty of dynamic range and great high ISO performance (You'd be hard-pressed to see the difference).- All three have two SD card slots and User 1/User 2 function.- All three are similar in size and weight. The D600 and D610 are pretty much identical to each other in that regard.- All three have a built-in flash.- All three have 100% viewfinder coverage.- All three have very similar buffer capacity.- Same 3.2" screen size (but the D750 screen resolution is slightly better going from 921000 Dots on the D600/D610 to 1229000 Dots on the D750).- They use the same battery.- They all meter with AF AF-S and AI lenses.The basic differences between the D600/D610 and the D750 are:- Price- Is about 10 grams lighter- D750 51 point AF focusing down to -3EV vs. D600/D610 39 point AF focusing down to -1EV in low light.- D750 is slightly lighter and smaller than the D600/D610 although it's barely noticeable.- D750 grip is deeper and slightly longer for a better hold if you have bigger hands.- The "OK" button can be reprogrammed to zoom into playback to 100% which is better than having to press the zoom button multiple times to check for sharpness.- Tilting screen on the D750 which is helpful if the camera is mounted on a tripod at lower or higher than eye-level etc.- Highlight-weighed metering (if you want to prevent blown highlights this is a nice function but you can also achieve this on the D600/D610 through matrix metering and setting it to -0.7EV to underexpose just slightly)- Slightly better video options such as being able to change the aperture in live view.- Built in Wi-Fi (You can buy a small external WiFi adapter for the D600/D610 for around $20 to $50).- Better weather-sealing on the D750 touted to be as good as it is on the pro bodies (although the D600/D610 are also weather-sealed well).- Faster FPS (6.5 vs. 6 with the D610 vs. 5.5 with the D600).- Better bracketing options (2 to 5 frames in steps of 2 or 3 EV 2 to 9 frames in steps of 1/3 1/2 2/3 or 1 EV whereas the D600/D610 can only do 2 to 3 frames in steps of 1/3 1/2 2/3 1 or 2 EV). This is beneficial to those who like to create HDR images.- Full HD 1920x1080 at 60 fps whereas the D600/D610 does 60 fps but at max resolution of HD 1280x720.- More Auto flash sync modes.- 1.2 crop mode whereas the D600/D610 have only FX or DX modes.- Better white balance bracketing options (2 to 9 exposures in increments of 1 2 or 3 EV whereas the D600/D610 do 2 or 3 exposures).- The D750 does a better job with in-camera high ISO noise reduction if you like to shoot JPEGs but it can sometimes be at the cost of detail depending on how high a setting you choose.- Native ISO sensitivity on the D750 ranges from ISO 100 to 12800 (options of ISO 50 in Lo-1 up to ISO 25600 in Hi-1 and 51200 in Hi-2 also available) vs. D600/D610 native ISO range going from 100 to 6400 and expandable from ISO 50 to ISO 12800 in Hi-1 and 25600 in Hi-2.To decide whether you should go with a D600 D610 or a D750 you have to ask yourself a few questions:- Do you own any full frame lenses?- How much can you spend?- If you don't have any full frame lenses can your budget accommodate a new quality full frame lens AND a full frame camera?- What will you be shooting and how serious of a photographer are you? Is this just a hobby? Is this just for shooting family events trips etc.? Or do you plan to shoot professionally?- Will you be shooting RAW and putting time into processing your files or do you plan on shooting JPEG only?If you don't have a big budget you don't own any full frame lenses yet and photography is just a hobby a D600/D610 will be more than adequate for the job. It will do at least 85% of what the D750 would do for you. It does a good job at tracking moving objects and it will have no issues with shooting portraitslandscapes or still life. Both of these cameras produce beautiful JPEGs provided you set up your shooting/picture menu correctly.Although the D600/D610 has 12 less AF points the AF is very snappy and accurate in good and in decent light. Also the frame coverage is not much less than on the D750 with its 51 point AF. If you're coming from a D7000 for example the AF on the D600/D610 is quicker and more accurate than it is on the D7000 (at least from my experience).If you have a bigger budget you already own full frame lenses and you're more serious about your photography (ESPECIALLY if you shoot sports fast moving wildlife or in dimly lit venues) the D750 is the one to own. Although the D600 and D610 perform very well (especially in the right hands and with the right settings) the D750 is just a bit better in that regard. If you're shooting for clients and you need to make sure you don't miss any moments as far as focus goes the D750 will provide you with that little extra assurance that the job will get done. The faster FPS faster and more sensitive AF better tracking abilities and great high ISO performance the D750 is more suited toward action.IF YOU ALREADY OWN A D600/D610...and you don't know if you should move to the D750 here's my opinion; The image quality on the D600/D610 and D750 is just too close to call. Yes the D750 is slightly better at high ISOs but in order to make this a worth-while upgrade you'd have to spend most of your time shooting at ISO 12800 and above. Most situations simply do not call for that. Most people will shoot between ISO 100 and 6400. The difference in image quality simply is not worth the extra $1000.00 between the three cameras. I've compared my D610 and D750 high ISO RAW files in Lightroom and I'm just as impressed with the D610 as I am with the D750. According to DxO Mark (if you trust their results) the D600/D610 sensor still scores just slightly above the D750.If you're mostly shooting portraits landscapes still life and light action in decent light the D600/D610 handles that just fine and the D750 will not produce miracles in that regard. The AF is better but not by such a large margin in those conditions that it would warrant an extra $1000.00. It's very low light focus and fast subject tracking where you'll see the biggest difference. If that's not a condition you encounter frequently I don't think it's worth the extra cost.The tilting screen is also not enough to upgrade to the D750 for still shooters unless you're into video in which case the additional video options AND the tilting screen are worth it.SHOULD YOU BUY THE D750?If you have a big budget you really want full frame image quality and you don't mind spending an extra $1000.00 for a D750 buy it over the D600/D610. While the D600/D610 are very capable bodies the little extras and the more sensitive AF of the D750 is just a nice thing to have in a camera. Maybe you won't take advantage of those extra features but if you need them they're going to be there. It's like deciding between a 300HP car and a 350HP car. Both will get you from point A to point B you can break the speed limit with both both are fast and will leave many others in the dust should you feel a drag race is necessary but one will get you there faster if you mash down on the pedal.If you don't shoot super fast subjects and/or in very dim (or rather nearly non-existent) light often you're on a tight budget and you need to use that budget to buy lenses as well the D610 is more than capable. It's an amazing camera and will get you great results no worse than the D750 would. There are some amazing deals on it right now.If you're on a VERY tight budget but you just have to have full frame the D600 is even cheaper than the D610 it is nearly identical to the D610 in every way but... know that you are taking a risk with the dust/oil on sensor issue. While this is something that doesn't affect every D600 there is a chance that you might get one with the problem. It's not a big issue if you're shooting below f/16 personally it didn't affect my everyday shooting but landscape photographers who shoot at narrow apertures might find this a problem when shooting empty skies where dust might be more obvious. Nikon has agreed to clean the sensor of any D600 regardless of warranty (as far as I know) so you do have that reassurance if it should come up but just know that this is a possibility. I loved mine when I had it I was thrilled with it despite experiencing dust but some people may not be as tolerant as I am or as willing to learn to clean their own sensors.SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN BUYING THE D750The D750 does NOT come with a screen protector or a flash hot shoe cover. You can purchase the flash hot shoe cover for less than $5.00. The charger does not come with a cord it's the type that plugs directly into a wall. I imagine you could buy a cord separately if that's something you really wanted but the wall charger works just fine.CONCLUSIONThe D750 is an awesome and enjoyable camera. It has all the great features any photographer would love to have in a single body. The AF performance and image quality are professional-grade and I think any enthusiast hobbyist or even professional would be happy with the results it is capable of producing in the right hands. I think Nikon really did a great job here. Usually I'm forced to say "great job Nikon but it could have done without this or that flaw". This time I can honestly say.... good work. You got it right. Please keep it up.
