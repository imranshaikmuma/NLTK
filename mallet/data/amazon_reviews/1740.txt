At first this feels like a great shirt but the longer I wore it the more unusual it feels. It just isn't very breathable especially for an active/workout shirt. Previous climalite shirts had some cotton in them but these are 100% Polyester which holds in heat and makes you sweaty. It's sad the 7 dollar Next Level shirt feels better than this Adidas one.
