My previous camera was a Sony Cyber-shot 16.2 mp DSC-WX9 that broke when the lens locked up.  that was a great camera but I don't recall paying $350 for it.  I use the camera for work so it's either in my pocket or hanging around my neck.  I go into damaged buildings so it's subjected to banging around and dusty conditions.  that's probably why the Cyber-shot died.  I thought I'd try the Sony W800 since it was a fraction of the cost and obviously because of my work environment I didn't feel a major investment was justified.  As others have reported it definitely is lighter and has a "cheaper" construction feel to it.  The bigger issue to me is the quality of the pictures.  The W800 has a CCD sensor where the Cyber-shot has a CMOS sensor.  I have experimented with all the settings and don't feel I've been able to match the quality you get from a CMOS sensor. Secondly the view screen is not as clear and you absolutely need to looking at it straight on.  There display is distorted if you are off to the side. One other feature that bugs me is the flash is positioned right below the trigger.  Why would you put the flash on the camera where you are holding it to take the picture?  I have plenty of pictures where my finger has blocked a portion of the flash.  Again it's for work so I'm not looking to frame anything I take but it is below what I'm used to.  Again for the price it's adequate.  After this one dies I'll probably make a CMOS sensor the priority feature.
