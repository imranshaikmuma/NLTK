In the first day I've worn them they've been great!  I have size 7 wide feet with high arches and purchased the size 38 EU/7.5-8 M US. These shoes support my arches and fit very well. My only fit issue is the outer ball of my foot on one foot. One show also has an extra 1/4 inch if trim hanging past where it should be tucked in. Not noticeable on a dark shoe I may try to cut it off.  If my feelings about these shoes change I will update this post.I tried a pair of Sanita in a size 39  and they were not for me. The shoe length is a little too long while the arch was where it should be based on the heel of my foot.  The top of the shoe the part that arches over the top of the foot was too tight and would have rubbed me raw. I couldn't go up a size because the shoes were already too long and going down a size would have strangled my feet even more. Sanita brand seem to be better for people with narrow long feet.** Update several weeks later **I've upped the stars to five!  The leather stretched so that little tight spot is gone. No slipping on wet floors. No blisters or pinch spots at all!  Looks great and are very cushioning for a long day. The arch support helps keep my knees and feet happy too. Really worth the money!  Before purchasing be sure to really read other reviews about how they're supposed to fit. The heel does not cling to the foot your heel is supposed to float and move in the shoe as you walk. Something for this sneaker wearer to get used to.
