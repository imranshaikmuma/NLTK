I got this phone on time and working as promised but after a month the LCD started coming off like something was pushing out from the inside and overnight the iPhone's LCD was pushed all the way out and the battery popped up like inflated and it seemed to be leaking some sort of acid.But this is not the main issue here the problem really started when I contacted Customer Service to find out they wanted me to pack the leaking acid phone and sent it back claiming the acid and the LCD sharp glass coming out of the phone are not a problem. SERIOUSLY?The second best option to get this solved was to contact the manufacturer which I did and they told me this is considered HAZMAT material and shouldn't be touched and of course the advised against shipping it back. Very Disappointing and I ended up with $300 dollar worth of hazardous Material.
