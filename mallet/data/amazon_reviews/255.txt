I am nowhere near a professional photographer and so far I take all my pictures in "child" mode (because I have two toddlers) but I think this camera is amazing! My old Nikon Coolpix finally drove me insane enough that I needed to get a new camera. I was sick and tired of all my pictures being blurred our messes that had to be deleted later. I lost so many great photo moments due to blurred faces or disappearing limbs I wanted to chuck the camera across the room (I didn't of course then I would be down a camera and have to clean up one more mess). I wanted to try stepping into DSLR cameras without killing myself with an impossible price tag. I did a lot of research. I read side by side comparisons  read over 20 reviews per camera I was considering compared all the numbers and looked at pictures taken with the different cameras. I even went into Best Buy for an opinion and to see how the cameras felt in my hand. In the end I went with this one (the snazzy color was a bonus but not why I chose the camera). Let me tell you how excited I was taking pictures with this the first week. I would grin from ear to ear and pester my family telling them how clear the pictures were. To dispel any illusions here I will inform you that my kids are hardly ever still but I have pictures of my kids mid jump on the trampoline and throwing leaves in the air (you can actually see the shape of the individual leaves). The moment when my son grins while his GG hugs him was not lost because they were moving or the lighting was bad. I have used this camera inside and out in good lighting and poor and I have not been dissapointed. The in camera edit features are fun too. To sum up this camera is fabulous if you're not looking for the most impressive camera on the market but for a great camera to capture life's special little moments.
