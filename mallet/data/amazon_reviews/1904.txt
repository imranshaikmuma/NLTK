An inexpensive and very functional notebook computer.  Solid state hard drive makes it very fast but it lacks enough memory and graphics processing for anything like serious gaming.  A great buy for basic word processing spreadsheets and internet connections.  Good keyboard and enough USB ports to connect a mouse for those who like myself are touch pad and touch screen impaired by arthritis.
