I love these liners. I was expecting them to be a bit thinner more like nylon thickness but they actually have just a bit more to them more similar to tights. Because they're a bit more substantial they're very comfortable and I love the tab on the back. I'm so glad I ordered 6 pair! They're perfect for my shoes for work and the tab makes it so they stay on my feet instead of bunching up into the toe of my shoe. Highly recommend!!
