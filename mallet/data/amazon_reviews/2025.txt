This is the second Chromebook I have purchased.  After years of using PC laptops I have found the Chromebook platform to be infinitely more useful for day-to-day tasks.  As pointed out in countless other reviews Chromebooks are not a replacement for those who need higher graphical or processing power (e.g. for pro-level photo editing high-end gaming etc.); however for web browsing email management and video consumption (i.e. netflix youtube) the Chromebook cannot be beat.The most significant differences in my opinion from a PC laptop are the start-up time and the battery life.  This Chromebook awakens to full use from being powered off in 3-5 seconds.  This Chromebook regularly gives 9+ hours of battery life--which is great however I have found that the battery lasts so long I sometimes forget that it needs to be charged leaving me with a low battery when leaving the house.  All other aspects such as wi-fi connectivity and web interfaces operate exactly as expected.As with all Chromebooks this suffers from a lack of processing power (compared to traditional PC's) which effectively means a significant drop in performance with 10+ browser tabs open.  However I found a chrome browser plug in called "The Great Suspender" to be the solution to this; as I understand how the plug in works it renders open tabs not used for a period of time effectively suspended thus saving on the memory drain.  When one wishes to un-suspend a tab using this plug in just click on the tab and it returns as it was prior to being suspended.  This gives me the ability to have 40+ tabs open at once with no memory drain.  It is a must-have app for Chromebook users.Overall if you have not yet tried a Chromebook and like something in the 13" screen range you cannot go wrong with this.  Its incredibly affordable and as with other Chromebooks exceeds all expectations.
