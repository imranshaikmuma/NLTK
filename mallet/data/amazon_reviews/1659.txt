This is my third pair of these shoes. I love them!! They last a long time. When they finally wear out I get another pair.  I am on my feet a lot.....most days walking 5-12 miles.They are very comfortable!!!! No breaking them in....they are comfortable from the first day on. I have high arches so it is very important that I find a shoe with a little heel and no high arch inside. These shoes fit that criteria.  The back of the heel is very stable also which is very important. I also get a lot of compliments on the appearance of this shoe. Over all I highly recommend this product.
