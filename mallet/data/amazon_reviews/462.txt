It's a simple basic digital camera but performs very well. The images are clear with little distortion except in very low light (most cameras have this problem - nothing unusual there and still better than our last pocket camera). The optical zoom works well. A big step up from most phone cameras. The controls are relatively easy to access and it is lightweight small. It seems well built and durable although we haven't had it long.
