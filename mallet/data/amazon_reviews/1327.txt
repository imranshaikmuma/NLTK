I just got this shirt and I must say I am really liking it. The color is lovely and the material is higher quality than I was expecting. Nice and smooth and slinky but not revealing. I ordered a size up from what I usually wear in junior sizes based on the reviews. It's actually a bit too big! I have had 4 babies and want to hide my post-baby pooch.I was looking for a shirt that fits like a LuLaRoe Perfect Tee. This is much floatier if you size up. I am 5'7' 180 lbs and wear a 14/16 dress. I usually buy L in women's and XL in Juniors. I wear a Medium in LLR perfect tee. I bought a XXL in this shirt. If you're looking for it to give you shape like I was I'd order your typical Juniors size. I don't know yet how it will hold up to washing.
