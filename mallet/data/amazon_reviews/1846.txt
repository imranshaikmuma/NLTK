I've been running an Acer C720P for a couple years now and while the Chromebook 14 isn't as fast on the Octane benchmark it more than makes up for it's performance compromise in build quality across the board. The aluminum is nicely finished. The 2400x1350 anti-glare screen is among the best I've seen. And I have a strange feeling I'll eventually find a use for the fold flat hinge which is unique. I've installed Linux via crouton and the only problem I discovered there is that the touchpad needs an old tweak at the terminal after starting the chroot to get it functioning properly:synclient FingerLow=1 FingerHigh=5This is an old bug in crouton that's resurfacing on a new machine.But those are nits on machine that I have literally waited for for years: 11 hours battery life while I hammered it Apple build quality high quality anti-glare display and perfect compromise between performance and power consumption. If you're like me and you like to leave your charger behind this machine is a game changer.
