I bought this camera to have the option of a smaller more manageable camera. My main camera is a Canon EOS 7D with comparatively bulky lenses. Shortly after getting the camera I traveled 2000 miles to my nephew's wedding. I hadn't flown in 12 years and I was glad to have the smaller camera along. The camera performed extremely well all week - impromptu family shots tourist and nature shots and 170 un-posed wedding shots. All on one battery charge with plenty to spare. The pictures are very sharp and close cropping is not a problem. And I like the red color.
