I was looking for the old Lee Riders that were made out of cotton...these were those damn skinny jeans with the "stretch" spandex.  I have switched to Wranglers LL Bean and a couple of other brands because they sill make their jeans out of cotton...Dang it Lee why did you have to sell us out to the "skinny" crowd..You had a loyal consumer but I guess that did not matter.
