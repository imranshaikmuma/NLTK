I love the cut and color of this dress (although it is a dark teal not really dark green). However I bought it because the item description says "100% cotton" but the item I received has a tag saying "88% Polyester 12% Spandex." I can wear a little bit of spandex but am allergic to polyester. Can't keep this had to return it. I really really wish that sellers wouldn't misrepresent fabric content like this -- it is a huge waste of time and energy for everyone. [If anyone received a product that actually says "100% cotton" I would be very interested to hear it.]
