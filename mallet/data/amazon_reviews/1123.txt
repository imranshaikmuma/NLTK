I bought this. And went by the chart and the reviews of other buyers I went according . But was wayyyyyy too small. Very displeased. I'm a size 15/16. And I can comfortably only get 2 clasps on. But the product does have a nice material and seems like it would be good and hold up if it wasn't for it being so damn small/tight
