This camera has everything I've ever wanted in a compact.Legitimate viewfinder full manual controls fast lens fast frame rate (10fps+!) and it's very small and light weight.It's the camera I've been waiting for since digital cameras came out. (no joke - there isn't another digital camera on the market that comes even CLOSE to offering what the RX100 III does.)It has officially replaced my Canon 5d3 setup for travel.Excellent as an underwater camera as well (with use of Nauticam underwater housing of course).
