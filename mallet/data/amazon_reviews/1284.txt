Tall people rejoice!!! These yoga pants are plenty long so you can avoid that awkward "flared-leg-with-ankle-showing" thing that is TRULY TERRIBLE (possibly a personal pet peeve????). Literally there is extra material at my feet which is both wonderful and rare.The pants are also very comfortable because that what yoga pants are in our life for. The colors are true (I got  both black and gray) and the seams are all pretty firm. Buy this now.
