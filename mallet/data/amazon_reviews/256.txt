Amazing camera.  This is my first higher end camera and I'm not disappointed.  I bought this camera for a trip and my photos are wonderful.  Previously my pics where of the iPhone variety.  Good enough to look at on my phone but not print out.  It's not so technical that a newbie can't figure it out and as I learn I see that it has all kinds of features.  All in all I'm very happy with my purchase.
