*UPDATED*I originally gave 2 stars. However I have now dropped it to 1 star. After sending back the first 2 I purchased because the sizing was WAY off I reordered even before being refunded. Now again I will be returning. This time just one of them but none the less it's a real inconvenience.1st. I ordered a navy and ash shirt. The navy color was as expected. The ash on the other hand was not ash it was very light heather grey. Tag shows "Ash" it is clearly heather.2nd. They are still big for being "Small" the navy shirt made in Honduras seems to be closest to the medium shirts I normally wear hopefully after a wash it shrinks.The "Ash" shirt seems like a large/extra large and again is heather grey made. This one made in Haiti. It's not the fit I wanted nor the color so I will be returning AGAIN.Overall my rating is based on experience as well as the fit and product description.*ORIGINAL POST*2 stars because the 2 I ordered were massive. I ordered medium size shirts and got medium size shirts according to the tag. All the shirts and even jackets I own are medium size. They were more like large maybe even XL in size. I returned them and ordered the small. Crossing my fingers that they fit otherwise returning them also. The hassle to return something and wait for a refund is the reason it got 2 stars. The quality seemed fine to me and the colors were true.
