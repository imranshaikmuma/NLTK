I am not used to wearing scrubs but these seemed nice. I am 5'4" 145lbs and bought the medium petite. The elastic waistband is nice but if I was a little bigger they would probably start to be snug on the hips. They aren't tight around my thighs which is nice since they are a little on the large side. They are a little rough and stiff out of the package but hopefully a wash or two helps that. I paired these with the Cherokee women's v-neck top and the color matched perfectly.
