ordered petite as im only 5ft tall&while the shipping was lightening fast i was very disappointed that they sent a size 'small' and being so short i cannot wear pants made for normal ppl at least not in the scrub world&due to the fact my new job has color coded uniform requirements I was forced to wear these pants therefore i HIGHLY doubt i will get a replacement nor refund.  Nonetheless I was highly annoyed to have to walk around with my pants dragging on the ground causing me to walk on them AND trip on them.  Not to mention the quality i have come to expect from Cherokee was clearly lacking.  the fabric was very think et rough to the touch-reminding me of low quality sheets you get in the Bed-in-a Bag sets at Walmart.  Typically if i want a cheap pair of scrub pants I can find them for $6-10...NOT $16-esp when it appears they wear made from cheap sheet material and then add the wrong size? Apparently the quality of Cherokee was went downhill in recent yrs&their order processor cannot distinguish between the words 'small' and 'small petite'.  I VERY seldom write a negative review-thinking i have MAYBE one other time i did in my 67+yrs as an Amazon Prime member. VERY disappoint et angry.
