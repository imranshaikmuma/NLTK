SECOND UPDATE:  I've decided to keep it after all having figured out a battery work-around.  Camera won't function while connected to a computer whether charging or transferring.  To get around this I've got a 10000 mAh external battery solar charger that I connect it to.  With the external battery hanging from a belt loop and the Re connected to that via USB cable the camera can still be used while charging.Another feature I'd sorely like it to have:  a physical on/off switch.  While walking today this damned camera turned itself on and took 260 photos of the inside of my pocket.  The ONLY way to power off the camera is through the software app.  A physical on/off switch somewhere on the camera itself would be very useful.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&UPDATE:  Sending it back.  The miserable battery life of this camera makes it unusable without a near constant charge and that makes it pointless.  I can only hope that the version 2.x is better w.r.t. both hardware and software.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&The camera itself is ok.  I knew that it had limitations but the form factor and size/weight were big considerations.  Photos are good quality but you have to know when to turn the wide-angle feature on/off.I am thoroughly disappointed though by the software implementation.  (Have tried Android haven't yet tried iOS.)  Things that should work like "files will transfer when you close the app" don't.  Settings like "transfer only when charging" turned on/off don't seem to have any effect.  Setup connection and re-connection are slow and cumbersome.Biggest gripe:  Failure of the app to use the SD card.  I can't install nor move this app to the SD card and when I do transfer photos via Bluetooth from the camera to my Android 5.x phone it sends them to a predefined folder in my internal memory.  No option for me to change the folder at all!  No option to redirect the photos/videos to the SD card!  My Samsung S5 has 16 gb internal 64 gb MicroSD card.  I discovered this lack of necessary feature when my images quickly filled up my 16 gb internal memory.I will be keeping the camera and using work-arounds like pulling images off the camera via USB cable to my Mac OSX.  But I'm hoping that when the RE v. 2 comes out it comes with more reliable more thoughtfully designed app.
