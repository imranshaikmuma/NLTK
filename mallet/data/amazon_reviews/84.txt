This camera is toted by reviewers online as being one of the best in terms of video quality.  Well that's true but the audio is filled with the infamous audio background hiss.  The shotgun mic it comes with doesn't have a setting to limit sound input to +20 or +40 dB.  So basically the mic is not much better than the built-in camera mic.The picture quality is very high-quality as is the video quality.  The audio is a deal-breaker though.  You NEED an external mic with adjustable dB.
