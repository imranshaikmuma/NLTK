This one I bought for my wife I have an LG G4. I feel this one is a bit faster than the LG the screen is perfect and the best advantage is that it can stay alive without charging for about 48 hours. The settings is not as detailed as in the other one and I just realized there is no NFC chip in it. But it comes with a screen protector and a cover the fingerprint scanner works pretty good. For this much it is a perfect buy.
