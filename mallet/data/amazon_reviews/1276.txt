The sizing on this garment is definitely way off.  A 2XL is definitely like a medium.  I am afraid I would need like three sizes up.  It was way to small and uncomfortable and fit very strangely.  The thong part was extremely small and while I could get the material over my chest it would not lay down across the stomach.  I've definitely realized this companies clothing is sized small and will not be ordering from again.
