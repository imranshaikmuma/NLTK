Use: Management job in grocery store. Bending moving stocking crawling on tiled floors between shelving kneeling on concrete etc. These have seen a lot of abuse knees have not torn out like more expensive dickies do.Size: Extra large. I typically wear size 16 jeans/slacks. The extra large fit perfect upper leg thigh portion a tad snug but not uncomfortably so there's still room to move.Shipping: professional.Pro's: The added belt loop is great. Side cargo pockets are deep and hold a lot. Key D-ring although I don't use it.Cons: Back waist is cut a little low but not a problem when wearing belt.Happy customer good purchase. Will be a long time customer.
