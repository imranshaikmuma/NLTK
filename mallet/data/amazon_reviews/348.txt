Returned item extremely limited menu options focus is slow so it doesn't take pictures fast enough (my phone was faster) build quality is very cheap I thought It was going to break when opening the battery hatch and to top it off the charging cable is SONY PROPRIETARY Why on earth is it not USB?? Terrible for travel if all of your gear is USB...except for this darn thing. I've had a lot of Sony cameras in the past and they were great..but this model is a joke.
