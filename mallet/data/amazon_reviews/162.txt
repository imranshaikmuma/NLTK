I've been wanting to upgrade to a full-frame from my D7000 for a while now and the D750 hit all the marks.  Light fast fps good size buffer good ISO double SD cards Wi-Fi tilt screen and amazing autofocus.  On the latter I could not believe that it was able to focus on my son Halloween night while he was trick-or-treating.  I could barely see through the viewfinder that night but it was able to focus on him 90% of the time.Now I agree with others that Nikon could have included more pro finishes.  I mean come on who is going to spend over $2000 on a DLSR and use the JPEG “special effects” mode.  People do not buy nice cameras for their post-processing features.  As well the 4000 shutter speed limit was a concern at first but after searching from my Lightroom catalog I could only find 5 shoots in the last two years where I took anything above that speed with my D7000.In any case all-in-all it’s an amazing camera.
