Opened up the package to find some of the socks have a pull in the material on the seam inside the sock. Pictures shown. Wore a different pair they fit nicely but at the end of the day I noticed a hole in both socks near the seam below the elastic part. Please note I did not do anything out of the ordinary when wearing these. I hope this is just a bad lot because are not quality. Pictures provided.
