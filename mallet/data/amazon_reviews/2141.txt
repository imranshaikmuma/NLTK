Worked okay at the beginning Froze for basic older games. Keyboard randomly cut out. Had to 10 second restart it multiple times. This led to what I believe is partial hard drive failure. Now it takes more than 10 minutes to simply restart and sign in. Task manager even stops responding. I'm am in the process of returning this laptop and getting another product.
