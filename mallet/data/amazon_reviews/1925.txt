Given the cost of this laptop I give it five stars. My only real complaint is the trackpad has a flimsy feel to it otherwise the build quality is decent for a laptop in this price range. It's not as solid feeling as a Macbook but it's also less than half the cost in most cases. This is the first Windows laptop I've purchased in over a decade and I'm pleased with it.Much to my surprise there was next to no pre-installed bloatware or trial-ware on this laptop. There are two Acer programs used for general maintenance and adjusting the screen a trial for MS Office and that was it outside of the smaller apps that come with Windows 10.  I expected to spend lots of time uninstalling all kinds of nonsense and was pleasantly surprised that I didn't have to. There is also no pre-installed anti-virus software (aside from Windows Defender) and no other pop-ups promotions or anything else. It basically ships as if you did a fresh install of Windows yourself.After getting the requisite updates from Windows and nvidia (which I recommend doing before Xmas if you're gifting this to a child) and configuring it to my liking this laptop is smoking fast thanks to the latest i5 and SSD. In this price range I was unable to find a laptop with a 7th gen CPU SSD and dedicated GPU. I recommend this one.
