These are true to size. I read the other reviews and went down a size and they are too snug. 5'9" and 155 does need a medium not a small....at least for my pear shape.they are too long which means the mdium length should be a great length. I do plan on ordering these in regular medium length and in the mediums. These are a great pair of scrubs otherwise!
