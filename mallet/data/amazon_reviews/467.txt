The size is just right. for portability.  I have many Power Shot Cameras that are excellent and better than the ELPH 170 IS.  The feature that I like best about the 170 IS model is its macro mode for close-ups of flowers etc.  It is small and light which I can carry with me all the time.  The photo that you preview on the view finder is not as good as the image that is down-loaded in a computer. It is very economical at $139.  I recommend this camera to anyone who has the need for the above features.
