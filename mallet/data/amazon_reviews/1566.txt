Oh gosh I have so many pairs of these. I am 118lb 5'5" with narrow hips and wear XS - I can fit fine into XXS but the whole point is comfort and movement! Night shifts (my day shift requires "real" clothes) and honestly weekends - you can go to the store in these in the more neutral colors and they look enough like pants for me! Deep pockets too. If they flared a little less they would be even better but then they'd need 6 stars :)
