IT IS BRILLIANT!  After three years with a 5D Mark II I finally see the light!  The auto focus in the 5D Mark III is spot-on first time every time.  I have been living with Canon L-Series lenses and what I thought was state of the art body in the Mark II.  NOW . . . I see that the Mark III is a totally different camera with a tack-sharp auto focus.  I didn't realize that the Mark II could be better until I got the Mark III.  But let me put my money where my mouth is . . . the Magnolia below was photographed with a 100-400mm lens from about 30 feet away.  I thought it was a throw away shot when I took it and when I got it home I was amazed.  In fact they got the auto focus from the 1 series cameras and it really shows.  Again the Mark III is WORTH the money and is what a high-end camera should do.
