My Samsung S5 took a swan dive off a treadmill so I had to get something else. My contract is not up until November. I came across this BLU phone with fairly good reviews. It came super quick nice work Amazon.The phone itself is a good basic smart phone for $59. Its appropriate for someone who just needs a phone and will use some basic apps. The phone is nice and thin and I like the case. The touch screen is not that responsive as a Samsung or my work I-Phone 6s. But obviosuly its a fraction of the price. Its a little harder to type on then the bigger names. The other two things I notice is 1. its just slower (starting up opening apps scrolling loading) again its a cheap price and fair enough. 2. The camera is not very good especially in low light. I can live with these issues for a few months. I just needed a hold  me over phone. It started up perfectly and accepted my AT&T SIM card without issues. The interface for email contact and text is a little different but fine. Bluetooth and WiFi work well.  If you love your phone and are on it constantly you might want something better. If you need a basic smart phone its totally worth the money.
