Went on an 1900 mile motorcycle trip and treated my non water proof boots with this in one application.  Rain repelled right off and I actually had to help a fellow biker who dropped his bike in 5 inches of water.  Walked out to lift his bike and stood their for over a minute in the water.  No a drop got in the boots.  Would buy again but have more than half a can left.
