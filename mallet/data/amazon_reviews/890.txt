The Huawei Honor 8 as I have read is one  of the best smartphones that no one knows about and I can't argue that point. I have only had it for a few days but I am very impressed with it. The Honor 8 is a finger print magnet and it is smaller and lighter than the phones that I am used to. But having said that it has a very feel and balance to it. The demsions are andt 5.5 x 3 inches and as I stated earlier this puts it about a half an inch smaller than my other phones. The Honor 8 is running Android 6 and home screen lancher called EMUI  version 4.1. It is supposed to help organize your "Honor 8 experience". While it was okay I went back to the Nova lancher (my preference not pushing Nova).  For those interested Huawei had brought back the NFC funtionality but I (at this point) have no need for that. The online reviews compares this phone to the Samsung S7 but at almost the the price. At roughly $300 this is a very good phone video and sound quality are very good. This is a mid range phone that in my option competes directly with the higher end models.
