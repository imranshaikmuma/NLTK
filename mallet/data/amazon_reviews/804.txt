Overall this phone is ok. It's very cheap so you get what you paid for.Don't expect this to be just as good as any other smartphone out there. The internal memory is very low so you really can't download more than 1 or 2 apps unless you root it. Whatsapp works fine on it which is what I got it for picture quality is ok as well. Forget about web surfing even if you have a good connection it's a 30$ phone.
