This is an awesome camera.  I think some of the negative reviews are from people that don't take the time to learn how to use it correctly.  I was one of those people until I spent a ton of time going through the manual and playing with the camera to see what different settings do.  An example of something that I learned that made a huge difference when using the semi auto (Shutter Speed or Aperture) settings is what to do with your flash settings when taking outdoor pictures.  If you are manually setting your shutter speed and  flash is set to Auto it will never tell you that that speed won't work.  You could set it on 1/2000 and it will stay white (setting OK) because it believes the flash will fix it. The flash can't light up the whole outdoors!!  Turn you flash off  and it will go Red if you set the shutter speed to fast.  This is just one example of inappropriate settings causing bad pictures.  The zoom on this camera is incredible.  I posted two pictures taken from the same spot.  One no zoom the other fully zoomed (optical + digital 120x total) in on a toy that is in the middle of the first picture.  Pictures were taken with no tripod. It is beyond what I thought zoom could do on a compact camera!
