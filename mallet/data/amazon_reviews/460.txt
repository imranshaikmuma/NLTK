This little camera is truly amazing!  We recently went on a two trip to Europe.  I was looking for a small camera which could take good quality pictures and was more convenient than lugging around my DSLR.  Boy did I find it!  Quality of images is superb.  Color reproduction couldn't be better.  The camera's ability to handle difficult lighting situations is phenomenal.  It focuses quickly in any lighting situation in which I used it including low light.  Because of its small size and versatility I was able to capture many great images on the fly that I would not have been able to get with my larger camera.  I could not be more pleased and highly recommend this camera to anyone!
