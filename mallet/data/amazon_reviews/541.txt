This is the first Canon Camera I've bought (after a few others) that actually let me down in terms of image quality. I was hoping it would be a good point-and-shoot for above water use as well but I'm very disappointed with the photos. Maybe because of its waterproof nature and having to have a glass over the lens most shots look like they were taken through a window with some odd light effects at times. Resolution seems compromised and the images are fairly noisy. I think my Samsung Galaxy S5 android phone takes better land-based pictures!I will still use this for underwater photos which I haven't had a chance to put to the test yet but for above water I say you'll still need a different camera and now I have to spend more to get one. How its quality compares to other waterproof point-and-shoots I can't saysince this is my first but if you think it can "do it all" and you're somewhat discerning of photo quality you may be as disappointed as I am.
