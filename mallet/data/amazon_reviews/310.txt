It's a good tool for anyone getting into 360 video/images it is simple to produce 360 images/videos because their software does the automatic stitching of the two cameras.  For this price point you are not going to get or should expect clear images or video like what you would get from a 6 camera GoPro rig.  Unfortunately their software is biased towards compression speed vs clarity so videos tend to be on the soft side even though the original footage on the camera is relatively sharp.  It is understandable since the videos would be quite large if they did not compress it so much.  I look forward when they will produce another camera with higher resolution and maybe an external storage interface.  The current 8GB gives you about 45 minutes of video recording which is more than enough since the battery dies before that but it would be great to not have to constantly remove data from the camera to free up storage.
