Great camera and quite the upgrade from the D80 that I had been using since 2007.  Not as physically smaller as i had expected from reading some reviews but I think that is a positive because it is still easy to handle.  The biggest differences from the older Nikon DSLRs are the weight and the high ISO performance.  This camera is super light and with a small/light lens is very easy to carry around.  The high ISO performance is amazing.  I used to hesitate to use anything over ISO 800 because of the distracting noise but with this camera I don't even think about it.I do with that it had the dedicated dedicated buttons of the D80 but you have to step up to the D7xxx series for that.  That being said the touch screen is fast and responsive and once you get used to it all relevant functions are within easy reach.For those concerned about purchasing this refurbished camera through Beech Camera or Cameta Camera have no fear.  Both are solid reputable sellers and the camera is not gray market.If you are in the market for a DSLR that has more bells and whistles than the D3xxx series but don't want to pay the big bucks for the D7xxx models the D5500 hits the sweet spot.  Especially for the refurbished price!
