I love this dress. It fits perfectly. I am 5'4" and 130lbs. I ordered a medium and it fits so well. I ordered a similar dress from another company and I was dissatisfied with the fit so I returned it and bought this one and I'm so happy that I did. It is very flattering *even on someone who hasn't hit the gym since before all the holiday eating.  I'm also super conscious of the length of my dresses and this one is appropriate for work and church.  The color is beautiful  (I ordered the green).  I love this dress so much that two other colors are on my wishlist for Christmas.
