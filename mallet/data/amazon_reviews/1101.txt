I ordered a size large in this top.  I could have gotten away with a medium but I want to wear this top with leggings and this is perfect for that.  I am a 37 bust 35 waist and 42 hips and I have plenty of room in this shirt.  It hides the tummy and flatters the body.  Love this top.  It is thin but not sheer.  I ordered 2 colors.  Red and Jade
