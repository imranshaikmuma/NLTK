These shoes are great very well made and they are a pretty leather bright red color.  Out of the box they are uncomfortable.  You must know this before trying.  I am an 8-9 in most shoes but I tried both 39 and 40......I will be sending the 40 back.  Pay attention to sizing.  SIZNG IS SO IMPORTATNT.  These take a while to break in.  THEY WILL STRETCH out so if you have room in the beginning they will be flopping..  THe break in period takes time but these will last you for a few years if you wear them often.  I work in a hospital and I wear them 3-4 days  a week.
