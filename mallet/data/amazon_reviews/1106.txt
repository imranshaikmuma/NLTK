I ordered a medium and was nervous about how these were going to fit. Couldn't be happier! I'm 5"9' with a 35" inseam 150lbs and typically wear medium in yoga and running pants. The pants are very fitted which I was planning on. Running pants are usually short on me. These are perfectly at my ankles maybe 1/2" or less above low profile running shoes. They stay in place during workouts. I've worn them several times before writing this review just to make sure I'm happy with them. So they've endured running  yoga and weight lifting. Several runs through the washing machine and still holding their shape with no issues in the seams. They are the black and grey plaid--the fabric is thicker than I was expecting  and I'm thrilled. No see through issues and they don't creep up (doesn't look like my body is trying to eat them--you know what I'm saying). I will say that I'm not tight and fit (still toning and working off some baby weight). I have a little "muffin top" in these nothing a top can't conceal and not detectable when I'm in a zip up jacket and honestly I have yoga pants that are less flattering than these. They're going to look even more amazing after I finish toning. I'm ordering more in different patterns hopefully I'll have the same success with those. Well worth ordering! I'm beyond happy with the price. These are my favorite workout pants right now. They're more durable and look better than some of my $90+ pants.
