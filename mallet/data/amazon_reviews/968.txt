I got this last July loved the phone btw. Recently the phone randomly stop charging so I dis/reconnect it. That fixed but now that doesn't work anymore I've gone through 3 different wires which worked for 2 charges then stopped working again googled the problem turned out its the charging dock so I went to the Motorola website to get it fixed since I'm still covered by the warranty... is what I thought but them a$$holes are charging me $75 to get it fixed I've had the phone for 3 months 3!!! Months!!! WTF happened to "we stand by our products" Motorola?
