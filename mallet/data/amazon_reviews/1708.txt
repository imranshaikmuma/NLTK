_Do not_ purchase your bandanas from CCEnterprises.  Although you're supposed to be getting 100% cotton bandanas like you'd purchase from Sears or Walmart the red ones I received from CCEnterprises were of some sort of synthetic fiber manufacture - extremely thin slick feeling not at all like cotton.  I left them in the basket for my wife to wash thinking maybe they would feel right after a trip through the washing machine.  First words out of her mouth when she took them from the dryer "I don't think you're going to like these bandanas."Now the blue ones I ordered at the same time came from a different vendor Accessory World. I didn't find anything wrong with them.  But stay away from the cheap-@SS crap CCEnterprises is selling.  I'm out the return postage with nothing to show for it.  I'm not happy that Amazon seems to think it's fine that CCEnterprises is selling crap and misrepresenting what it is they're selling.  Straighten up and fly right Amazon.
