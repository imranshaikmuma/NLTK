I'm a professional photographer an I owned two additional Sony cameras (DSLR-350 & 100) and my DSC830 performs as well or sometimes better than my larger cameras.  It's lighter to carry and much smaller so I can take with me all the time to capture current events and incidents I see in my daily travels.  My enlargements from my DSC830 are just as clear as professional as if they come from my larger cameras.Thank you SonygrhphotosGary R HudsonCorning California
