Slow out of the box. I enjoy how it's thin but the build is all plastic and extremely cheap. Boot speeds are really slow more than a few minutes. Windows don't respond 9/10 times. This computer is pretty bad might be good for surfing the web but is not recommended for emails or students. A solid state drive might help but you're better off buying a better laptop for 100 bucks more. I restarted bit and it's been 10 minutes and still no boot. Mind you this is a gift not for myself they might end up hating this.
