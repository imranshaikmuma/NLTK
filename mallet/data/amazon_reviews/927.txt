So I bought the 64gb moto z first and used it for 1 week and I absolutely loved the phone. It was super thin super fast I love stock android and for only $50 more it was a no brainer however my biggest complaint with all androids I have owned is battery life sucks so I always end up switching back to my iPhone. So I been reading all the reviews and everyone is saying this moto z play is the best battery life ever and also saying that the snapdragon 625 is a powerhouse. I was in dis belief before buying this phone that both of those statements were true. So let me tell u I absolutely positively love this phone. The first day I setup the phone to my liking and still went 2 1/2 days on one single charge. Also the snapdragon 625 is pretty dam fast. No stutter no lag whatsoever. I have to say I don't play games at all so I have no clue about game performance. I am a heavier texter some phone calls internet browsing and YouTube. I can't praise this phone enough. Take this review with a grain of salt and test it out for yourself but I will say that I returned the 64gb moto z and just did something I thought I would never do. I sold my iPhone 7 today that's how much I love this phone.
