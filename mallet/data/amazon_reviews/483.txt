Have had this for maybe 3 months and am pleased with it so far.  I purchased it to replace a 'Coolpix' model S2 which finally died after some 5 years of pretty heavy use.  It took me some time to learn how to operate this camera for taking close up shots of stamps in an album which at least 50% of my useage is for.  With the S2 I mounted the camera on a tripod that positioned the camera lens maybe 14 inches above the object to be photographed.  I used the zoom feature to where I was able to enlarge a single stamp to fill almost the entire photo.  Trying to do this with the S3700 on the same tripod using the close up setting didn't work.  (Could not focus).  Actually had the same problem with an S2800 which I returned to Amazon after speaking with Nikon customer service who recommended I return the camera to their service department. (Also learned that the S 2800 was an old product).  It was only after again having had the same problem with the first example of the S3700 which I again returned to Amazon because of the same scenario wth a Nikon customer service rep that I got to talk to a Nikon Service rep that understood what was happening when I again experienced the problem with the second example of the S3700.  He informed me that the camera lens on the S3700 must be within 2 or 3 inches of the object when operating in the 'macro mode' setting. The Nikon instruction manual makes no mention of this.  Once I purchased a 'Goliton Mini Desktop tripod' all my problems were solved.  I think the close up shots now are even better than those I used to get with the S2.
