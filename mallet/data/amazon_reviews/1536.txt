Not sure if I got a bad pair or what. I'm an avid Asic's girl. I run/jog/walk a lot and I only wear Asic's. I was really excited to get these they are super cute and I love the elastic laces they come with. BUT they are like walking around on bricks. My first run in them the bottoms of my feet hurt. I thought surely they'd soften up but no such luck a month later and constant daily torture and they still suck in the comfort department. I get lots of compliments on their looks and I agree super hot!! So for that 2 stars. Otherwise I'd burn these stupid things. Not a happy runner. Also I agree they do run small but more on the width side not length they are more narrow than other Asic's I've worn.
