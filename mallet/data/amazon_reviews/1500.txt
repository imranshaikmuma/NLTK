Comparable to the sizes of other brands pants. I thought the material was a little thin. However for the price I was not devastated by it. Overall they are nice little pants. They lost one star because my daughter said the tag is itchy and it bothers her occasionally. I would not recommend these pants for a child with sensory issues for that reason.
