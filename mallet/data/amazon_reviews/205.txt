I was waiting for the 5d mark III successor to come out but so far nothing but rumors of what it will be and when it will come out so I took the plunge and bought this.  This is an upgrade from a canon 70D that I used for shooting indoor high school fast action sports.  Stepping up to this full frame made a huge difference in photo quality.  I was expecting "much better"  and found what I got was beyond that and my expectations.  I usually used fixed 2.8 (70-200) lenses and shoot wide open aperatures.  Everything about this is better than the 70D except I saccrificed 1 FPS in burst mode.  I am just an amateur with barely 2 years experience but find my photos now easily rival those taken by and sold at the venues by the pros.  My local newspapers are giving me media credentials to go and shoot for them as I gain experience.  Bottom line this camera does not disappoint in meeting my goal of shooting great action photos in poorly lit venues.  I am shooting in manual with 1/500 shutter speeds f/2.8 and my iso (camera set to auto iso) is rarely above 3000 in worst cases and usually 1500 or less.  Beads of sweat on athletes faces clearly visible (70-200 lens zoomed in) on subjects 40+ feet away.  I do realize Nikon has more cameras that outperform this is ISO tests/ratings and for somewhat less money but after buying the 70D first I committed a lot of money to good canon lenses and just didn't want to sell everything canon I have and start over with Nikon.
