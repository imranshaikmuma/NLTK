They were a little loose but not too bad.  The pants were a little long but most usually are since I'm only 5'1".  I was pleased with the quality and fit however I had to return the items because the color was wrong for my job.***UPDATE***I was really impressed with my first order of these scrubs so I decided to order a pair of black ones - my job requires black pants and we rotate shirt colors during the week. The material is good not see-through or too thick and rather soft for scrubs. I ordered an xs this time since the last order was a bit but. They fit nicely but the pants are still a bit too long on me. The elastic is snug and they have a drawstring to tighten them a bit if necessary. I also have to roll them over once to keep me from walking on them. The shirt fits nicely as well a little big on me for an xs but it's expected. Overall I am happy with this purchase and plan to order more from this seller.
