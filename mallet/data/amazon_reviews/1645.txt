So...Crocs DO run big. I now wear a size 9 or even sometimes 9.5 in men's shoes but in CROCS I wear a size 8 men's/10 women's (they are unisex). They still feel a bit big but the thing is it's because they are so wide at the top. I have bunions so this is great for ME and also if you are on your feet for hours your feet swell a bit. When I first got these years ago I felt like they were gonna come off my feet but they did not even if I don't use the heel strap. They end up kinda conforming to your foot and almost get "tighter" over time. The non-slip bottom is truly non-slip even on greasy or really wet floors. I wouldn't recommend them necessarily for dog walking around the block on icy walks as this particular siped non-slip tread (siping is basically tiny cuts or openings in a tread they do it to tires as well) is really meant for floors not ice but that said I HAVE walked my dog in slippery conditions and been ok. I use my older ones as shoes to put on when I do a quick potty walk or have to hose something off even gardening tasks. I just got a new job and am in a kitchen environment again so ordered this new pair just for that as we have to wear black. My old ones are at least 5 years old and the tread is still good actually. You can't hurt these things you really can't. You can wipe 'em clean they don't stink and they ARE ugly as sin but hey function over form is the way to think about CROCS in this case. Most CROCS don't really have a function but these ones definitely do and in my opinion are the best kitchen shoes I've had. FYI I also like Dickie's work shoes with the non-slip tread I got them at Costco for $20 but they are not quite as comfortable as these CROCS.
