This is a very solid phone.  I sold my iPhone 7 Plus due to financial constraints and use this as a replacement.  It's inferior in a few ways: no 5GHZ Wifi not Apple processor/RAM lag when running many apps or resource hogs camera & screen; however it holds up to iPhone 6 on all but the Apple component of those deficiencies.I will stress that you should buy the Amazon version the ads are not noticeable.  However there may be an issue when it's time to update the device because the Android software will need to be Amazonized before it's rolled out.  Also make sure you setup the phone with your Amazon ID because adding it later will cause issues registering the Motorola ID.  That being said for $100 there is not another phone that brings an experience close to this one.  In fact you must spend at least twice as much to get an equivalent competitor.I'm impressed.
