This is for the MAX not the 5.5 laserPros:4100mAh - reason I bought this phoneVery long battery life even with wifi and apps running.Decent price for what you get feels solid in terms of build.Screen is very vibrant no issues with the quality(even if it isn't 1080)Finger print scanner work wellSurprisingly snappy for a budget phone with 2GB of ramPhone can also charge other devices with it's dongleDecent camera both front and backComes with a 2.0 Amp charger(more of on FYI than a pro)Cons:I knew these features were missing prior to buying the phone that is why I am not taking off any eggs-No gorilla glass-Apparently no fast charging but I haven't had any issues with power given the large battery-Not 1920x1080 screen I hear that there is a version of this phone out there with one but can't find it on sale anywhere-CPU is a little underpowered however this is to extend battery life. So far aside from the initial out of the box set up I haven't had any speed issues-roughly 6.8GB left free on the phone itself after OS + updates it will take an SD card so for me the free space is enough-Blutooth seems to drain battery faster than other things might be fixed in a firmware update(?)-Asus android updates are slow but that is the company thing not the phoneSide notes:This is a BUDGET phone with a focus on BATTERY LIFE. If you aren't looking for one of those two things when considering this phone please don't rate the phone low because you didn't understand the market it is targeting. I travel a lot for work and I got tired of carrying around a spare battery or a usb charger so far this battery is lasting far longer than anything prior I have owned. I wouldn't buy this if I was going to focus on gaming or powerful apps spend the 30-50 dollars and get the Laser or a Honor 5x for a good mid range phone. This is by no means a power users if you want a powerful flagship phone obviously you won't find it for <150. If you are looking for a good phone focused on long battery life even with wifi and other things running this is a great phone for you.
