These are the first pairs of Carhartt pants I have purchased and frankly I'm a little underwhelmed considering these are or at least should be "work pants."  Since they just arrived I can't talk about durability but I can offer some initial impressions.  The fabric is a cotton twill which simply means it's very similar to what you might find in a pair of casual Dockers pants and frankly I thought given the nature of the pants might be a bit heavier fabric.  While described as a "relaxed" fit and that term varies by manufacturer they certainly aren't as "relaxed" as my Sam's Club jeans and seem to run about a 1" waist size small.  I would have hoped that a "work pant" where the wearer might regularly be bending or kneeling would be a bit more generously cut.I'm thinking about sending them back but going up 2" in the waist might be too much.
