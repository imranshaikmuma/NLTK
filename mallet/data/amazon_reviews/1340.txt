These are very comfortable and seem to be of good quality.  My problem is with the length.  I had done a search on Amazon for 'tall leggings' and this is what came up.  Even though there is no listing of the inseam reading reviews I though they would be long enough but sadly they were not.  I usually take a 34-36" inseam and these were closer to 30".
