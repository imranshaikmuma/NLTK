I love this jacket. I was looking for something similar to a north face fleece jacket but at a lower price.The color is right. It fits a little bigger than I expected. There's definitely room for a few layers underneath. The material seems like it'll keep you warm without being too heavy. I purchased one in the light blue color and one in charcoal gray. I love them. Would buy again and would recommend this product.
