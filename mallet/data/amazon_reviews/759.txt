The phone seemed fine for a day but after using it for less than a week the battery died at a extremely rapid rate and I had to put the phone on speaker to hear any calls. Lastly the home button started to get really clicky and harder to push. Very Unsatisfied returning product. Not to mention the fact we called them about  this and its been almost a week and they have not called back
