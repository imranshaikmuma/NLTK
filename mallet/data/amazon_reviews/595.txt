I can't quite decide if this is value for money or not. It's very handy and sleek and has a bunch of modes you can play around with. But the picture quality when you zoom in isn't that great. And it's awful at taking pictures in the dark-- or maybe I have yet to figure out how to do that correctly. As far as point and shoot cameras go this one isn't too bad for your general tourist pictures. Not the best bet if you're hung up on capturing distant images or images with great detail. It works for my amateur needs though hence the 4 star rating.
