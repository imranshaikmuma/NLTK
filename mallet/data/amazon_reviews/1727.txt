It's comfortable for casual wear and although it's certainly not a tough shirt it's not flimsy either somewhere in the middle. If you are looking for a long sleeve to stay warm this is definitely not a cold-weather shirt. It might protect against a small chill but its definitely more of a casual or warmer weather shirt. One thing I would note is that I like to wear long sleeves and roll them up when the extra length isn't needed and this shirt has small wrist cuffs that make it difficult to do that; although it's still comfortable if you wear it long sleeve like you should.
