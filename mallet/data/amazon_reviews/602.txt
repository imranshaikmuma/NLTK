Bought 1 then a second after seeing the results.  With four Energizer lithium AA batteries and a 32 G SD card the camera will run for a year on the 5 minute (no night pics) setting.  Amazing.  The setup is mostly intuitive but a few minutes with the manual is helpful.  Bottom line is that this is a terrific value and the next step up in complexity and quality is a quantum leap.  There are lots of options if you only need a system to work for a few hours but when you're interested in documenting days weeks and months it gets bulky and messy.  It's a very wide angle view and understand the resolution is low so you will generally not be able to identify people you don't know; if you need a high resolution image this isn't your choice.I have these set up monitoring the exterior of a remote cabin.If you're mounting outside using the clear housing and expect rain I recommend polishing the lens area with Rain-X or something similar. You may not be comfortable with the included mounting options.  I mounted a couple of $6 camera swivels on a cheap angle brace.
