I haven't owned a pair of Carhartt jeans in over 15 years closer to 20 as the last time I had them I was working as a carpenter. I now run a welding/fabricating/mechanic/maintenance operation on a fleet of car haulers so I've been in the market for work wear that has very high demand set on it. After reading some of the lower reviews on here about Carhartt I was a bit skeptical but I took sizing into consideration based on reviews for this particular pair of pants.I couldn't be more impressed. These pants fit lovely exactly the way they did when I was young. They're comfortably firm in the waist and perfectly loose and flexible everywhere you need tbem to be. I have to roll under trucks weld in odd inverted positions crawl out of car windows and climb trailers all night to secure loads- these pants are exactly what I need.The main deciding factor on choosing these pants is Carhartt's wise decision to move manufacturing back to the U.S.- the same reason I continue to buy Red Wings boots. I'll gladly pay more for superior materials and craftsmanship- and it butters another Americans bread as well so it is a triple win at that point.The inseam is a bit long on these pants but who cares? It won't be long before they start to fray out at the bottoms and the extra length will buy me a lot more use out of them.Sign me up for a bunch more in the market for more Carhartt work wear too- jackets hoodies etc.
