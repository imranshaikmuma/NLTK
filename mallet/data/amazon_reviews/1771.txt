These socks were exactly what I was looking for in socks. I needed light-weight low-cut or no-show socks that were cheap and available in a couple of colors. These socks claim to be no-show but I find that they show around 1cm above a sneaker. This is perfect for what I wanted but just be aware these are not exactly "No-show" even on size 10.5(mens) feet.The size of the socks straight from the packaging can be seen in the photos I have attached.Each box came with 6 pairs of socks (12 individual socks total).White and black both fit the same and have been washed several times with no shrinkage that is noticeable.Pros:*light-weight--Breathes well even in California heat*Low cost*Cut lowCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:Just be aware that these socks on a size 10.5(Male US) still show a bit.Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up <.5 rounds down) => 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
