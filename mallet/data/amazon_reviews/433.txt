Focus isn't great can have a hard time finding you especially for selfies which is odd because a green box will pop up on screen to say it's recognized there's a face there but then it focuses elsewhere often.  Often!Love the zoom does great color rendering.  Handles night shots (where the flash fills you in but gets the display/architecture/fountain) behind you in nice lighting very well.  Fast to turn on strong battery life.
