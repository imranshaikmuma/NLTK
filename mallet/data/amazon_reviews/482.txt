Now that I've had this camera a few months I feel I can properly review it:This is a surprisingly great little camera. Is it the best camera ever? No of course not. It's a point and shoot camera. But it's a good one.I've not owned a Nikon before and decided to give it a try. There's a lot less features on this then other similar cameras on the market especially in regards to different "modes". For the most part I don't even notice that the modes are limited to under ten though I do miss my Sunset mode.Where this camera shines in in the close-up detailed nature shots. The colors it can capture at close range are amazing for a point and shoot and I find it focuses easily even against reds and purples that other cameras have trouble with. Everything is crisp in the Marco setting and if you are out of focus you can try before clicking the button all the way and taking the picture; the display is that good.The place where this camera looses some of its' appeal is in action shots. For me this is not a big deal since I mainly take nature photos; nothing is moving in the frame. However if you plan to take action or speed shots this may not be the best option. It takes a moment (even without a flash) to snap the picture. This can mean you might miss something darting by.The menus and displays are slower too and the camera takes a minute between each shot and when you turn it on and so forth. I'm not sure what the delay is about but if you can be patient with it you probably won't mind.All in all this is a great camera for the price and that's all any of us can ask for.
