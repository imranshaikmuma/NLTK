I had no idea what these tops would look like outside of the pictures or how they would fit. I have large breast so buying women tops online unless I knw how it'll fit I normally don't do. However these tops fit perfectly I got a 4x in fear a 3x wouldn't fit my chest an I was right.. Even after the first wash (I wash before wearing I followed the instructions after that I use cold water like colors) they didn't shrink! The top isnt to loose or to tight an I'm happy.. The pockets are great deep an large. I fit my life in them multiple pens Sharpe's thermometers (for cooking) my cell phone the occasional piece of fruit keys. Those pockets replaced my purse while at work!! The material is great too its not cheaply made at all. I usually wear a tank under my work tops/coats (not a nurse I'm a Chef that works in healthcare) scrub tops usually feel thin but not these. Not so thick you melt in hot temps or weather.And a cute side note the inside collar tag the "made in country" changes. Which I found cool one was Haiti the other Egypt. Hopefully their not using child labor!!? And with the yellow smiling wink on the sleeve I was able to recognized the brand when the local "Scrub Truck" came around an got a few more tops!!
