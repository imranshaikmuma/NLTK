I absolutely love these shoes and knew I did as I've tried them on multiple times in stores and have been planning to buy some for 2 years now.  That being said I was of course really excited to get them!  They arrived in perfect condition and are adorable.  I typically wear a 6-61/2 but some converse fit me a little big and I think it makes the toe look long so I went with the 6.  I could have gone with the 6 1/2 since these are tight with thick socks... but I don't plan on wearing them with thick socks and actually plan to wear them without socks sometimes so they're absolutely perfect.  Love the slip on elastic back!  It keeps them snug on my heel and I'm one of those who rarely unties my tennis shoes anyway just slipping them on and off (I know I know it breaks down the heel cup LOL).  Anyway these are great little shoes lightweight and comfortable and really cute!
