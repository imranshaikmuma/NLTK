Great computer if your looking for a gaming laptop that wont break your bank yet has all the items you need. I was way overdue a new computer. My previous gaming laptop was about 7 years old...was a older ASUS g73jh. I got every pennies worth of my purchase out of it with minimal problems. So when I started looking for a new computer the last 6 months...ASUS was given bonus points.I basically had a couple criteria on what I wanted. Had to have a SSD preferably 512gb. Had to have video card with at least 3gb. Wanted a solid constructed device. Didn't want one that had reviews of people saying it felt cheap or flimsy etc. If possible also under $850.I had narrowed it down to a few systems but in the end this one was the winner. I met all those criteria above. As a bonus...it had like zero bloatware. It has DDR4 Ram so ignore the DDR3 of the information..that was for older version. I bought a second DDR4 Ram simm...the computer has two slots and the 8gb in it is one simm.Ive only had the computer a few days but its been flawless so far. I was able to run Elder Scrolls Online at practically max settings with no problem.
