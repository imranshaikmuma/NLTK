I like the camera and it takes decent pictures and video but it has some drawbacks. I gave it the H20 test in Puerto Rico recently while snorkeling and it came through for me. I have pictures and video that I wouldn't have had without the Ivation or one of the disposable underwater cameras sold on the boat. It's solidly built and the 20MP images are huge.The drawbacks:1) The battery compartment is the dickens to get open. I know the seal has to be tight for the integrity of the camera but it's a real challenge to open the thing.2) The design is lacking in that you can't plug in the USB cable in to transfer pictures and video because the mini SD card doesn't click into its slot and stay seated. You have to have the battery compartment closed for the card to work properly. With the door closed you can't plug in the cord. Catch-22.3) Making a video isn't intuitive. You have to hold the "M" button down at the same time as the shutter button to shoot video. Figured that one out at the dock while waiting to shove off since I'd forgotten the QuickStart guide and searching online for a manual proved fruitless.4) The selfie screen on the front of the camera is a nice idea but the lens doesn't have a wide enough angle for good pictures.5) There's no auto-focus when you press the shutter halfway down like you find on most digital cameras.With all that it's a decent camera would likely buy it again. Caveat emptor.
