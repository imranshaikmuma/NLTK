This dress arrived before the expected delivery date.The material is pretty thin and it is not very warm. I was hoping it would be a bit thicker. The length is great and the length of the sleeves are good but the sleeves were a bit tighter on the top.Very comfortable dress and perfect with tights or leggings.I am about 5'5 and 140 pounds and ordered a medium. I tried to get the best pictures I could to show how it looks.
