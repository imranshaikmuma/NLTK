I bought a canon point to shoot camera and was totally un-satisfied. I decided to return it and buy Sony DSCH300/B. As compare to earlier camera this is definitely better. night photos are much better and overall quality is very good.Good things1. Value for money.2. Photos in low lights are much better to other products from other companies in same price range3.Good 35x Zoom4. Colors are vibrant.Could have done better.1. A bit heavy and larger2. No inbuilt battery you have to use aa batteries
