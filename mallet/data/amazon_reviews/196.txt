This is my favorite DX camera to date and contrary to popular beliefs the D7200 is a massive upgrade over the D7100. Low light and high ISO settings performance are much better and the focusing system is extremely good (more accurate focusing over the D7100). I take this camera everywhere I go and just love the photos coming out of this camera. This camera has the performance of Nikon's full frame cameras but at the price of a cropped sensor camera. All the controls and dials are very well thought out and it won't be a stranger if you're used to Nikon D610 and D750. Unless you need the ultimate low light performance of a full frame camera (which is marginally better than this camera) then the D7200 is the right camera for a semi-pro shooter. I ended up leaving my Nikon D810 at home most of the time and this little guy gets to travel with me 90% of the time. Just get some good lenses for it and you will be amazed by the quality of this camera.
