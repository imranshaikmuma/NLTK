I've been using the Cannon SX40 HS now for over six months and I am rather pleased with the product. My primary objectives for it has been to obtain quality digital photos of birds and close-ups of wildflowers. The SX40 has excelled with both objectives. The features have allowed me to photo distant birds at maximum zoom and I obtain a clear focus image that can be editcropped and enlarged. The stabilizing features of the SX40 are outstanding. At maximum zoom I give the auto focus features a few seconds to find the target and bingo a great shot. I can take over twenty shots of the subject in less than five seconds. With quick selection of macro zoom for close-ups I can capture a close image of the smallest flowers with the lens nearly touching the petals. This is an easy to use high quality camera packed with features designed for digital photography. My only complaint involves the position of a display image button which I often accidently engage and this results in shut-down of the lens. I'm getting over 300 photos on the battery before it needs to be recharged. I wish it had a setting for manual open of the lens for night lightning shots. The SX40 and the software is superior to the Olympus Zoom cameras which I previously used before upgrading to the SX40. I give this product a five star rating and I would buy it again.
