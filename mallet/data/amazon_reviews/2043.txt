To get the performance you paid for you MUST DISABLE "SUPERFETCH" in Windows 10.  Before I did this I noticed the hard drive was at 99-100% all the time and ran really poorly.  After I did so the system runs really well.To disable Superfetch simple go to Start and type "cmd".  Then type "services.msc".  Press "s" and scroll down to superfetch.  Stop Superfetch (you will notice you hard drive light goes out now like it should).  Next change the "Startup type" to "Disabled".Enjoy your much faster systemPS:  If you like the tip feel free to send me an Amazon.com gift card ;-)
