The camera works very well the photos are very good.  The only two down sides are the battery life could be better.  The other problem is that every time I take the battery out to recharge it you have to reset the time and date.  It requires that you do that before taking photos.  I recorded video with sound and it is very good.  I really like the camera.  I take a lot of photos so for the average person who takes the occasional photo the two issues I mentioned probably would not be a factor
