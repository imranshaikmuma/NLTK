I spent a lot of time looking for a good deal on laptops and finally settled on this one. For most people depending on their needs (not gamers or people that do graphics) this computer will fit the bill. In addition there is not much in the way of bloat ware not even a trial antivirus program so there was relatively not much to remove.Relatively lightweight the computer charge on average last 2.5-3 hours depending on what you are doing. I'm sure you can extend that by disabling/removing several programs but I doubt it you would get above 5 hours. Unfortunately it is not a touch screen but at that price who cares it has a 1 TB hard drive so it holds all that I want with room to spare.  The disadvantage which I see many companies starting to do is that the battery is encased within the computer so there is no way to access it without opening it up; I say disadvantage as I use to buy extended batteries to replace the standard one and to have extra ones on hand if I was travelling anywhere.
