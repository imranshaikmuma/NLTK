I received this camera today was taking photos in less than 15 minutes and advanced photos in under an hour.  The camera is ultra-intuitive and does virtually everything for you.  The auto focus and image stabilization functions both appear to be perfect.  NOTE:  If there's one drawback it's this...the camera has extremely limited manual adjustments and no manual focus - the next model up (DSC-HX300) does.As a replacement for a Konica-Minolta S414 that I bought for 3 times the money back in 2002 I could not be more pleased...at least after 2 hours.  This is an exceptional camera for this price!!!
