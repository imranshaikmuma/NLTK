For background I am a medical assistant at a high volume clinic I stand/walk probably 7+ hours each day at work. I was pretty hesitant to buy these I will admit. They look clunky and heavy in the pictures and they look this way in real life too. But I highly recommend giving them a try! Despite being on my feet all day at work (and often longer due to going out to shop/run errands after work) my feet are rarely sore. I love that they are stain resistant and they are sort of smooth on the bottom (not slippery though) so that I can swivel around without actually having to lift my feet if that makes sense. They have been pretty durable so far I've used them every day at work for 7 months and they have minimal signs of wear and no signs of falling apart anytime soon. Added bonus: no shoe strings that keep coming untied! Love them.
