Great camera. Takes sharp pictures. Can auto correct for backlit subjects. I took this down to the pier where there was a lot of glare and rocks. The camera was able to correct to get definition in the rocks (close up) so they didn't look all black due to the shadows and yet the water came out sparkly like when you see it in real life. Looking forward to getting more photos.
