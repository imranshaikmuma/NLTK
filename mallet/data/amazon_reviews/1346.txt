I've bought SEVERAL pairs of these for regular use over the past year. 5'4'' 45'' hips 28'' waist thick legs. I've worn the medium and the large sizes comfortably. The medium hugs me better stays up better during physical activity and for me it wasn't see-through until it had been washed MANY times. The large slipped around a lot on me so I prefer not to exercise in them and I do recommend sizing down.Medium wouldn't reach the ankles of someone taller than 5'7'' I'd say the length goes up with the size. The gray ones do hit just a little bit lower on the waist than the black ones and they don't have the name brand on the hip. And I sincerely doubt that these are 50% cotton they're a very slippy slightly shiny material. But they're still my everyday legging and ideal for yoga and weight routines and I love to wear them with crop tops.
