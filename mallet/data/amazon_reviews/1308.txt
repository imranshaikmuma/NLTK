I ordered this product after ordering Tesla's cold gear tops & bottoms.  This brand makes a great product comparable to name brands for a fraction of the cost.  This material is also obviously a little thinner than the cold gear version.  I ordered the same size (medium) as I did for the cold gear but these are a little more snug than those.  Specifically the waist band is a little more snug but still perfectly functional for my liking.  I'm about 5'9" 165lbs and wear a size 32 waist for comparison. Though the mediums are a little snug I think the Large would be a little too loose in the thigh for me personally. I am using these for training and prefer a snug compression feeling.  So I'd say if you are a 32" waist you are right on the border between Large and Medium so just decide if you want more compression for athletics or a little looser for daily under garment use.All that being said my cold has held up great after my first couple of uses under my jiu jitsu gi so i'd expect the same level of durability and will update after a couple of uses and washes.
