I use my camera phone for most things but sometimes you need more functionality when taking pictures. I was looking for a reasonably-priced compact camera that was packed with features and had WI-FI capabilities so I could easily send images to my phone. After trying and rejecting models from Nikon and Panasonic I much prefer the Sony Cyber Shot. The Nikon and Panasonic models - at a higher price - either didn't connect with my phone (I have an iPhone 6) or doing so and sending the images was far too complicated. Once I had the Sony app on my phone connectivity was quick and I found it very easy to send images from the camera to my phone then I'm all set to upload to Facebook text message etc.
