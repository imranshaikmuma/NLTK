These jeans are very comfortable and the only person in the room who will know that they are "stretch" is you!  They look just like any other pair of jeans but they give just enough so that you are comfortable no matter what position you are in:  sitting standing crouching nealimg.  Also reduces the dreaded "plumber's crack" because of their ability to give just a little.  At a fraction of the cost of so many jeans on the market today this pair is a bargain for the price.  They look good feel good and wear well.
