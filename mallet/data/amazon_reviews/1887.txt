My wife loves it works fast for what she wants to do and a great portable size and I like how bullet proof and well built it seems to be over the laptop it replaced. Hinges are beefier and the spill proof key pad solid. Solid state drive should handle a drop too. Very solid function laptop for email web browsing and have MS office loaded and works well with that too. Very pleased with this laptop.
