Works as advertised. It *is* heavy but powerful. It drains the battery in a day or two even if the lid is closed.I bought this on Amazon with the 1Tbyte *very* slow hard-drive but I also purchased a 256Gbyte SSD independently. This saves around $200 compared to buying this very configuration from Lenovo. It took a screwdriver and about 5 minutes to put in the SSD and another 30 minutes to transfer Windows10 from the hard-drive to the SSD.
