While not as fast as some more expensive and high end phones it does what all smartphones do goes on the internet access to apps and makes calls. Got this phone as a replacement for my wifes Note 4. I think she likes this phone just a bit more than her Note. It's not packed with all the gimmicky features as the Note or other phones but it does everything else. Not sure on NFC for Android pay since I don't use phone. It's very light almost to the point I thought it was a fake phone. Camera isn't going to win awards but does a decent job. Screen is nice and clear. The biggest and best thing about this phone is the battery life. My wife gets about a day and a half on a full charge. Not bad at all considering she's a power user on the phone or maybe she finally realized she killed her Note by being on it all day even while charging. Either way it has fast charge and expandable memory something else she was looking for. All in all for not having to go to the store to upgrade an increase our bills it's one of the best buys we've done. Just put a glass screen protector on it for her sake. No app drawer easy fix I put nova launcher on there and tweaked it a bit and she loves it. Not bad indeed. Probably will.look another phones for upgrades in the future. OnePlus 3T for me I think.
