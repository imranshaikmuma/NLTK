Love these shirts for running. I recommend ordering a size smaller than your normal shirt size. I normally wear a medium and I ordered smalls so they fit more snug for working out and running. The smalls fit about like a medium size Hanes undershirt for reference. Unfortunately they have changed these to 100% polyester. They used to be 85% polyester 15% cotton (which is my preferred blend for exercise shirts). The new ones aren't nearly as soft as the old ones unless they soften up after a few washes. I liked that I could wipe sweat off my face better with the 15% cotton ones. Regardless these are still by far my favorite shirts for exercise. Lost one star for the 100% poly.
