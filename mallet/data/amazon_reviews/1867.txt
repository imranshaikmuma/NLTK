I have been using the device for almost couple of weeks and its almost perfect. I popped out the stock RAM for Kingston Hyper X 1600 Mhz 16GB Dual Channel CL9 kit and added a Samsung 850 Evo M.2 for OS drive. (Samsung Migration software worked great in transferring the OS).I will start with the cons:1. I got a battery which is already 9% on wear level which I will eventually replace under warranty if it goes haywire in few months.2. No Num Lock Indicator LED. (And its turn off every time after reboot.)3. No HDD activity LED.4. Fan Control is stupid in non taxing scenarios. The fans either do not turn on at normal usage and if they do they don't go off.5. CPU gets quite hot around 90C averaging at 85C  would have preferred it to be 5C lower. (Not using any cooling pad and Tjmax is 100C)6. The display lid is flimsy and flexes a lot even under slight pressure.7. BIOS Setup could have been more versatile and must have provided more options like options to disable Turbo Boost on Battery To Turn ON  the system when LID opens Num Lock Always On and similar options (I had a lot of them on my HP Pro book 440G2).8. Thunderbolt 3 would have been a nice addition and also the M.2 does not support PCIe/NVM based SSD.Now the Pros:1. CPU performance is exceptional GPU handles latest titles at 3.5/5 details with avg 30-35 FPS at FHD overall a very decent gaming experience. Have been play AC  SyndicateAC Unity GTA 5 Arkham Knight.2. Contrary to CPU heating over the level what I am comfortable with  GPU never goes beyond 75C even after a OC of 135Mhz/125Mhz on  Core/Mem from MSI Afterburner.3. Build quality is decent other than the display lid.4. Track-pad will not trouble you if you start using tap gestures (Double finger tap for RightSingle for Left) instead of clicking it.5 .Keyboard works fine for me and the typing experience is comfortable.6. Speakers are above average by laptop standards if you tweak them a little.
