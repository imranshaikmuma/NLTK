Works good takes good pictures but the AC adapter worries me. The most ghetto AC adapter I have ever seen seems as Sony is going the way of everyone else and making things cheap as possible... I realize it is for different countries or something also but it makes me worry about the quality of the camera. Does work good and take good pictures in the meantime though...
