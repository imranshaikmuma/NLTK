This is such a fantastic laptop! I took my time to find a perfect product and this laptop met all my expectations. I was a bit concerned because some people mentioned that it's slow. My advice is to ignore these comments. Unless you want to use it for the most advanced games I can guarantee that you will not have such issues. It's fast and reliable. It doesn't freeze and I didn't have any problems with Windows updates. It's quiet and pretty light but definitely does not feel cheap.The keyboard is soft and nice. I tend to work on several apps at the same time and watch movies online and the streaming is perfect. The battery life is impressive. I like plugging it into TV with the HDMI cable (not included) and can watch a couple movies while it's unplugged.The condition is perfect and I would never guess that it's beem refurbished. It comes with Windows so you don't have to pay for it separately.You can also get a trial version of MS Office for free but you'd need to pay for subscription after the first month.I highly recommend it!
