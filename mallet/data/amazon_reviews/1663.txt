I live in Buffalo.  The winds sweep unadulterated from western Canada and plummet in leaden misery upon Buffalo.  After a few months of bitter cold and dead skies this is a place where hot-sauced wings and emasculated sports teams become the hollow substitute to your ineffective anti-depressants.This jacket is another entrance to a Narnia of an endless summer.  I practically frolic within it.  The heavy duck is rich in color and warmth.  The cuffs are impenetrable to snow and wind.  The hood... oh the hood.  When pulled up over my head I am shielded not only from the blowing snow and rain but also the human misery that surrounds me.I cannot recommend this jacket enough.  The description and sizing are dead on.  It is ridiculously well-made.
