It has been 4 months since I researched and purchased this camera. For the sake of a real world review I am not going back to do the research to get my numbers EXACT. I am going to make a comparison against our D40 which we have used for 8 years. The improvements are as noted.8 years ago we bought a Nikon D40 with the 18-200MM zoom lens. That is a 6MP camera which has traveled thousands of miles and taken 68000 pictures.We bought this camera to move into the 24MP world before our first trip to Europe. What a difference the 8 years has made in the Nikon world! I won't bore you with details but I will say that this camera is 10 times as sensitive in low light conditions as the D40 (ISO up to 32000 or so) and about 4 times as fast in shooting burst mode as the D40. It has a multi-focal point focus system that uses around up 32 discrete points in the picture for best available focus (the D40 has 1 2 or 3) and it writes information to ultra fast SD Cards. Oh yeah - it is also 2.4 ozs lighter than the D40 with an improved grip (at least about 80% of folks think it is improved - so try it in your own hands)>
