They fit as expected. My only down fall is the right shoe rubs against my ankle. However that was due to my surgery 10yrs ago and ankle bone is raised a little. Otherwise fit as expected good quality. I've always wore sketchers. If you want extra comfort it's best to get memory foam inserts. They work wonders and help with them being comfy.
