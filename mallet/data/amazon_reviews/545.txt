Purchased this camera for a trip to Orlando so we wouldn't have to worry about taking photos in the rain or having the camera damaged on water rides or around the pool. We took about 600 photos and almost all of them came out very well. We let the kids take the camera underwater in the pool and they had a great time taking underwater photos. I have other Canon point and shoot cameras so the settings were very familiar to me. The underwater setting does a good job of adjusting the color. However if you forget to change the setting when you are not underwater the photos all had a redish tint. I checked for leaks throughout the trip and inside of the camera was always well sealed and dry. Very happy we purchased this camera.
