I wasn't real sure about this phone but ordered it anyway since my old phone was 6 years old and because my carrier requires you to purchase new phones. Overall I have been satisfied with my purchase. I inserted my sim (AT&T) booted up and immediately got a signal. It sensed all the data on my sim card that I also installed. While there is an easy learning curve and it isn't as refined as some of the top end phones being sold for under a hundred bucks it is hard to beat. I would recommend this phone just don't expect it to be the latest Samsung or IPhone. It will provide you with talk text data and allow most of the functions of the other phones. It doesn't have a lot of built in memory so plan on using a sim card. They are cheap enough. Camera and speaker are just OK. For my needs it does the job just fine.
