WoW!!!  I took a chance here because Panny doesn't provide options to tweak a lot of controls in this particular camera like most cameras.  However the results in every one of my test images were astoundingly good and probably better than anything I would have selected given the presence of those controls.  Some will view this as a negative and at first I was worried as well . . . but not now!  The images were all well balanced in highlights shadows color sharpness etc.  Panny has done a great job in balancing out the images.  The 5 Axis stabilization worked incredibly well even out to the maximum 720 distance.  Here again I was worried the images would be soft at that range . . . again I was delightfully wrong!  Panny was smart to lower the megapixels to just 12 given the small sensor here.  Noise was not an issue in any of my test images under conditions where there was reasonable light.  No doubt at night noise will creep in at higher ISO's but given the small sensor that is expected.Finally the much improved electronic viewfinder is what ultimately makes this camera so good.  No it doesn't quite equal my Fuji X100S EVF but it's remarkably good.  It adjusted very clearly to my aging eyes and even worked well with my sunglasses on in bright sunlight.  My primary camera is the aforementioned Fuji X100S but I needed a small long range camera and finally I've got the perfect complimentary tool.  No doubt a full DSLR with an 800mm Hubble telescope lens weighing pounds and costing thousands would take better pictures but for just $400 bucks I got a very nice really long range incredibly stable pocket shooter and I'm not complaining about the images at all.
