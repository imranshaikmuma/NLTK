I initially got this camera about this time last year when I started shooting wedding ceremonies. It may not be the Canon 6d or 5Dm2 I would have preferred but overall it worked very well. Since it's purchase this camera became my primary camera which I have used for everything from weddings  portraits concerts (mostly concerts) and the occasional autocross events.A quick disclaimer I do not shot the autofocus very often as many of my favorite lenses are all manual but on the lenses I do use it with (55 - 250 / 50 1.8 ) it does the job just fine. It is not incredibly quick by todays standards but there is no reason someone couldn't get great images with this camera at just about any type of event. I would describe the iso performance the same way. It is good I have no problems pushing upwards of 4000iso. It will produce a good amount of grain but is still useable in my opinion. That being said it seems most cameras can give similar results if not better nowadays.The lens selection for this camera as with any canon is amazing and is one of the main reasons people buy into the system. It handles great and the lcd and such work as one would expect. In the end this camera still a good option for someone that doesn't have the money to go for one of canons full frame bodies. This camera does have competition even in canons line up though. If seriously considering this camera I would suggest looking into a canon 70d. It may be a bit more expensive but will be quick to autofocus and have newer features. But if you find a 60d for a good price I would say go for it as it is a good camera.
