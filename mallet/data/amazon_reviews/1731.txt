I purchased five or six of these shirts a couple years ago and love them. They’ve held up very well and I still wear them often. I recently purchased three more and have found unfortunately that Adidas has changed these from a poly/cotton blend to 100% polyester. These newer shirt are not as soft and don’t have the slight flex of the older versions and don’t have nearly the breathability. They still fit well and I will still get use from them but they won’t be in my regular workout shirt rotation as they just aren’t comfortable enough anymore.
