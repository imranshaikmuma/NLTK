Nice little camera with metal housing and built-in LEDs. The popular free 'VLC Media Player' program will open it on a Windows 7 or earlier PC. Select 'Media' > 'Open Capture Device' > and select 'USB2.0 Camera' as the 'Video Device Name'. Make sure the video is displaying as 640x480 (mine was). VLC will also record the video but I didn't mess with that. I chose this cam because of the small diameter. It has good focus at 1.5 inches and beyond; many others on Amazon focus much closer if that is what you need. I used it to examine car engine cylinders through small (12mm) spark plug holes and could easily resolve cylinder wall honing marks. The built-in LED light is handy but the picture was far clearer in the dark reflective engine cylinder using a separate light (a handwired Mini-Maglite bulb in my case). This is also why pro photographers use a separated flash unit. The cam also comes with a magnet hook and most usefully to me a 45-degree mirror (~7mm OD) which threads securely onto the cam's housing. Using this basically requires external lighting since you again get too much reflected glare from the built-in lights. I also discovered the mirror has an almost imperceptible protective film you peel off- ah much better now! The mirror allowed looking 'up' at the engine valves etc with some twisting about. I'll probably use it mostly for fishing wires; just add on USB cables for longer reach. The bend radius on the cable is ~1/2 inch and tighter if you kink it.
