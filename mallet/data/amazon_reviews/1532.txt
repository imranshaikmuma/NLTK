You get what you pay for.  The fabric is stiff and a bit uncomfortable right off the bat not sure how it will hold up (hopefully improve) under washing because I returned my 2-pack of white scrubs.  The white is semi-see-through.  I am exchanging for a set in black.  I bought through Allset product to get the Amazon Prime shipping and returns were very easy.As most reviewers say this UNISEX product runs very large for average-sized women.  I usually wear an M in women's clothing and I ordered the XS which fit well.  Since they're unisex the pants don't have much give for booty but tying the scrubs at my hips (where all the doctors/nurses I know wear them) instead of at my waist makes them fit fine.  I'm 5'9" and the pants are maybe an inch too long for me.  If you're a super-tall skinny man the scrub pants might be too short.
