Fits great finally found the color purple I needed for nursing school. I think the zippered jacket looks nicer than the button ups and it is definitely more functional for me in the hospital. Extra pockets a plus. The local scrub store told me the color was discontinued and they couldn't order it for me. I was happy to find it cheaper here.
