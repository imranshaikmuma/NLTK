These are without a doubt the best scrub pants I have ever owned (and I've been a nurse for 20 years).Fit: I'm a chubby girl with no rear end and these fit me perfectly. I get the 2x petite. I don't even have to use the drawstring. Just the elastic is perfect to hold them up.Fabric: I'm pretty sure this stuff is made by aliens in some advanced civilization. It stretches just enough. It always retains its shape. And it stretches everywhere not just at the seams.Style: the fabric is richly colored (I love the black pants most of all). There is a lot of seam-work on these and they use  a slightly contrasting color. So you see the seams but they look good. On each pair there's a cargo pocket on the leg that has a stretchy bright yellow loop. I guess you can thread scissors or hemostats through it. I'm not sure really what it's for. But it jazzes it up a bit and it's cute. And since it's stretchy I can play with it while I'm stuck on hold for ages ordering a test! The cargo pocket is actually a large pocket in the back that has a small mesh pocket within it that's good for holding a small phone or pager-type device. Then layered over that is a split pocket. So for one pocket patch you get 4 pockets. And you have the typical pants pockets (slash type) as well.Stability: I work 5 days a week and I have 5 pairs so they all get washed every single week. And they still look brand new 6 months later. I don't baby them either. They get thrown in there with the rest of my dark clothes on a regular warm cycle. And they look great.TLDR: they're magic buy them.
