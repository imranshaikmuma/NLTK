Great phone! Simple straight foreward non redundant settings menu. No bloatware or adds. Perfect size & thank you removable battery!!!  I kina like to see a battery that swells up due to either over charging or bad knock offs before it explodes or catches fire!!  A few of my Nokia & Samsung S5 batteries did this over the years warning me of needed replacements so no fires. No processor lag for me and camera is fine enough for most of us. You have about 11GB free internal memory.  I ditched my Samsung S5 because of AT&T OTA branded updates back in Aug locking my phone up & wiping the data. I only miss the outstanding 16 MB photos & on the fly editing of the S5. The Moto G4 play with removable battery GSM + CDMA carrier capabilities for the money is hands down the best one out there. Most newer phones have screens too large. This one is perfect!  I am not a super gamer & I have not tried a CDMA carrier yet. With Consumer Cellular just install your old sim works great! Thanks Amazon!
