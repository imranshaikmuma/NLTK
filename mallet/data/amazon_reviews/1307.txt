I have ordered small and medium.  I am 5' 4" tall and weigh 167 lbs.  The small are a little shorter than I like and come about 2 inches above my knee but fit great.  The medium fit but not as good as the small but they come to right above my knee.  I wish the small was longer and they would be perfect.  I put my height and weight in so it makes it easier for people to figure out the right size.  If your like me and you read the reviews some say the product runs big and some say small.  The ones with the persons height and weight helped a lot.  Also one other thing is if you wear these without shorts over top and you sweat a lot they get wet or you decide to swim in them they can or will be see through depending how wet they get.
