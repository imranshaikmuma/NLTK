It is nothing against the seller because I received my purchase in remarkable time. I just am not very happy with the camera. I thought that it would be a little better quality than it was. You definitely get what you pay for. I should have just paid another $20 and purchased a camera of better quality. Also when you purchase a pop up comes up and asks if you want to add a memory card do not do it. This camera has no place to even insert one.
