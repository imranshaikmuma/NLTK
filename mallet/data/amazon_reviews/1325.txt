I wanted to love this shirt:(...the material feels fantastic.  It's extremely soft and stretchy and very comfortable.  The color was also appealing.  However I ordered a L after reading through the reviews and it honestly looked like a mu mu on me.  From the chest down it hung so much that it was like a had a curtain (and don't get me wrong I love flowy loose tops to wear with leggings) on.  I'm considering reordering a M to see if I like it simply because the L had so much extra material on me that it wasn't flattering at all.  I'm 5'7" 130 lbs. 34C.  Hope this helps some make a decision on sizing!
