Cons:1.  Fairly large power brick2. Short power cable3. Slightly annoying fan the goes on and off every few seconds but runs at constant under load4. Heats up to 80 C fairly quickly in gameplay if settings are cranked too high5. Dual core i7 though it is a fairly good processor just don’t be misled by the i76. Not a fan of the num-pad takes up space that could have been used for speakers or fans7. Mouse pad won’t click easily in the bottom corners8. Thick screen bezels9. Somewhat dim screen brightnessPros:1. Light and thin as hell for its power2. 512gb of fast SSD major upgrade from my HDD3. 960m can run light games (Overwatch will run fine just mind the temps)4. Will switch to the Intel graphics when not under load saving battery5. Backlighting that can get fairly bright when you need it6. Touchpad is pretty nice7. Keyboard quality is pretty good.Overall a pretty solid machine for the sub-$1000 price mark. The 8gb of ram is enough in my opinion. My biggest gripe has to be the inconsistent fan spin/noise and the overheating though the lightweight and sleekness of this laptop outweigh these downsides. It’s as light as the 15 inch Macbook pro. If you want a lightweight laptop that you want to do some occasional gaming on I’d recommend this machine.
