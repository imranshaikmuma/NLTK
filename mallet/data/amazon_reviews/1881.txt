Nice little machine!  Wildly portable.  It can actually run League of Legends smoothly on minimum settings though I'm afraid to stress it with more than a game at a time (it didn't get overly hot or anything I'm just paranoid).  I recommend grabbing a trackball mouse and an external hard drive with it.  With heavy use (gaming music and Facebook all at once) it gets about 6 hours of life on the battery.  Idling and minimal use gives me 12-14 hours.  I have no complaints for the price ($180 at the time).  It has proven very durable but I could imagine the swiveling camera at the top of the screen breaking off if you hit it just right.  I still love it.
