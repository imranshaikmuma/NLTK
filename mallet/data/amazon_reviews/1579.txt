Not that it's necessarily Amazon's fault but I was very disappointed in the Carhartt t-shirts I ordered via Amazon very recently compared to those I bought in-store at Sears two years ago.  The ones I bought at Sears were manufactured in Haiti and exactly what I was looking for:  100% cotton NOT stretchy and of a relatively heavy weight.  Now after two years of heavy use and many washings these shirts are still wearable but beginning to look a bit worn.  So I purchased what I thought was the same shirt from Amazon--but when they arrived I was dismayed to discover that they seem to be a lighter weight.  Even worse although the tags claim that the shirts are 100% cotton they are slightly stretchy which leads me to believe they may contain perhaps 1-3% lycra.  The Amazon shirts were manufactured in Guatemala.  I want a heavier 100%-cotton t-shirt with no lycra and no stretchiness and will go back to shopping in-store for t-shirts so I can see what I'm getting before purchasing.
