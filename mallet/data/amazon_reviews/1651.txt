Great feel spacious comfy and easy to keep clean but not at all durable. The 'non-slip' soles frequently slip (even though both stores I've used them at have anti-slip tiling) and have peeled off the shoe twice. I have had to reattached the soles with super glue but that was only a temporary fix as they are wrapped up drying again for the second time as I type this. The soles peel off startiting from the front which means you'll be tripping over floppy soles and slip n sliding all over the place. Initially the grip was fairly decent only minor slipping which I chocked up to grease and such on the floor but even after using the sprayer at work to clean the grease out of the soles and after scrubbing down the floors I still noticed slipping - in the recent weeks I've almost fallen on multiple occasions because the grip is just nonexistent at this point even though the soles are only moderately worn at the edges (not exactly a comfortable experience considering the myriad of hot surfaces and sharp edges I would have to catch myself on in the even I actually do fall - and I don't think crocs would compensate for lost wages in the event of an injury)Asked my boss about his crocs slipping and he said he has had no problems but from the look of his shoes and the soles he has the 'specialist' crocs - which are more low-slung on the tops and have different soles (this pair is definitely not as 'stream-lined' as the 'specialist' pair which looks like it has  bit better breathability) looking back I should have returned these after the first week of slipping but working full time didn't leave me an opportunity to wait for new shoes in the mail while these were on their way back. Now that they're on their last leg I just purchased a pair of the 'specialist' no-slip crocs and hopefully those will be just as comfy and actually not slip instead of surprising me constantly with a life-and-death game of "can you regain your footing?"This particular 'bistro' model of shoe should honestly be discontinued by Crocs due to the pants-shatting experience of constant slipping in the kitchen.
