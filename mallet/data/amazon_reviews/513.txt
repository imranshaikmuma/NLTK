I never thought I would buy a point-and-shoot camera especially one in this price range.  I've been a fan of SLR and DSLR cameras for almost fifty years and I love the flexibility of being able to get a lens that is ideal for every situation I might encounter and even use it without a lens on microscopes and telescopes.  What attracted me to this camera was its high frame rate- up to 1000 frames a second for slow motion videos.Somewhat to my surprise it is also a great general purpose camera and I find myself using it in place of my DSLR a lot of the time.  The astonishing range of the zoom lens surpasses my DSLR lenses and the picture quality is just as good.  The image stabilization is also excellent- again better than my DSLR.  I couldn't imagine being able to hand hold a camera at equivalent 600mm FL yet this camera does it with ease.This camera is also smarter than any camera I have owned which is both good and bad.  If you snatch it up to capture a fleeting event it usually does a good job but when I want something specific it often seems to think it knows better- not always correctly.I had been warned that this camera has poor documentation and user interface but I was still surprised at how bad it was.  If you want to use the enormous range of capabilities that the camera provides be prepared to spend lots of time experimenting searching and learning.  I got the Kindle edition "Photographer's Guide to the Sony RX10 III: Getting the Most from Sony's Advanced Digital Camera" by Alexander White and it does a good job of getting you started.The camera is big and heavy which makes it easy to hold and keep it steady.  It also provides space for the numerous dials and controls- some of which can even be customized- when you have spent the requisite hours learning how to do so.This definitely isn't the ideal camera for everyone but I am finding that I like it more and more.
