This rig is awesome so far no complaints. I love the build quality the keyboard. I don't have much feedback on the touch pad since I do use a mouse regularly. This laptop is certainly on the heavier side but I like its professional yet gamer profile. The JBL speakers are great nothing to write home about.I'd certainly advise throwing an SSD into this as the built in HDD is awfully slow. For the price you can go ahead and build a much nicer desktop however for portable business users that want casual gaming experience this is perfect.
