If I could leave zero stars for this product I would. I will forever advise against anyone purchasing a BLU product especially after their abhorrent customer service.The charger ceased to work after a month I.e. past the time that Amazon would cover it so I emailed them. It took them two days to reply and by that time I had given in and bought a charger (which by the way is a USB-C. I'm well aware that they're trying to move the industry in that direction as opposed to the current standard the micro-USB but at the moment local retailers do not sell them and when they do they are $20+).This time I thought the charger had given out spent $25 on a new charger which wasn't charging my phone. Checked it on another charger that definitely worked on other devices did not work on my phone. I emailed their customer service again because I could not call from a broken phone that wasn't charging and wouldn't even turn on. They emailed me back two days later again with a form to complete online and a technician would contact me. I later received an email detailing how to do a hard reset--with a phone that won't even charge or turn on?Needless to say their products are inferior the company is not dedicated to keeping their promises despite a warranty covering the product (it is well within the six month warranty coverage) and the customer service and technicians are largely uncaring and unattentive. I will be surprised if they let me send in my phone.
