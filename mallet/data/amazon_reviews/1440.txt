I love these pants so far I just bought a whole bunch in several different colors. I am an Engineer and I work in a plant environment. These are great b/c the look good and they hold up well and are durable and are super comfortable. I like the non-pleated pants better myself.The only issue I have had is finding the colors I want in my size. I have purchased the Navy Blue in store at JC Penny had to get the Khaki color from Sears and also from Amazon and the Bark color I got on amazon. I have not been able to find the Ocean color in stock anywhere which is something I would like to get and is the only color I haven't found at this point.They also come in several other styles that include pleats or the non pleated pant like this one. They also offer this in a denim style and there is a polyester blended one called the Cool 18 and they make that in all the same configurations. I am reluctant to try the Cool 18 polyester pants since they feel somewhat flimsy in the store. I am really not sure if they are worth trying or not if you want to find something for the hot weather. I might try a pair this summer.
