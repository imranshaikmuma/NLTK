This is an initial review as I've only had the laptop for 1 day so far. My old laptop was starting to crap out and it was time to replace it.  Some initial items that stick out to me on this laptop.  The touch pad is much more sensitive than my previous laptop.  The pointer jumps sporadically at times from the slightest movement.  The 10 key pad for numbers has the zero one spot over from the usual 10 key set up.  For someone like me who does 10 key without looking this is going to be annoying.  The num lock key and cap lock key don't have an indicator light so you don't really know if they are activated or not until you type something.  This is already annoying.  The battery is lasting only two to three hours. It was advertised at four to five.  The screen froze today while watching a youtube video. I couldn't escape out of it or alt control delete to end task it.  I had to do a hard reboot.I plan on using this laptop for work related stuff as well as games.  I'll update my review up or down after more use.
