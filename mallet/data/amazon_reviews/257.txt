I got this model as I hae used and loved the D3200 and the D3300 has a few changes that sounded interesting.  The 3300 is slightly smaller with a new smaller lens and has some new effects that earlier models don't have.  I got a refurbished one at a very good price.  These should be just as good as new for a good price so save some money if you can.
