By not as described I mean the make not the material.  I am 5'7'' and 120 lb and considered slender to most.  I ordered a medium due to the size chart and reviews.  I thought the pants ran small they do not and are not form fitting nor tight what so ever.  These were like tents on both legs.  The material was excellent but when the description said flare and you get huge bell bottoms I was disappointed.  I also thought the fit thru the leg would be more narrow but definitely not at all.  Its really hard buying online sometimes and that is why i am writing this review to help alliviate concerns and give my interpretation of the product.
