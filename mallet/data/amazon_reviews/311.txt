It does what it says it does. The pictures are pretty decent as long as you have even exposure. Doesn't do terribly well when one side is lit much brighter than the other. Video quality is just ok too despite the massive size. And it takes FOREVER to process. If you take a 10 minute video be prepared to not be able to use the camera for 10 - 15 minutes afterwards while it processes.As long as you know what you're getting into (new tech in a relatively new field) you'll be fine. Support isn't quite there yet the apps are still a bit quirky and clunky but if you know what you're doing it's relatively easy to navigate.Wish the battery life was longer or that you could power through USB while shooting to memory (currently the only way to power off USB/DC is when you're in streaming mode which requires a computer. Removable media would be nice too..
