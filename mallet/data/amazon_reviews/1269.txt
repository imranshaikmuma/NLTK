Liked this so much I bought two! One for me (for my anniversary) and one for my best friend and sister (as a gift from her matron-of-honor upon her wedding :D)It is SEXY!  My hubby likes it a lot.  A whole day after seeing it he remarked again that he liked it :DI bought one in black for my sister and one in purple for me.  The purple is brighter than I expected but I don't think it is much different than the color depicted (it probably just looks different on my skin).I am about 5'6'' and 130 lbs. B/W/H: 34''/27''/37'' I got the size small and it fits great! Nothing lacking.
