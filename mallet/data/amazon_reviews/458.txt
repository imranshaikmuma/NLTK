I wanted to write mainly about the size of this camera.  But let me back up first...I had a previous ELPH that was working fine for a few years but I started noticing cataracts in my pictures.  Examining the lens I noticed that the lens was scratched in the middle from what I assume was the lens cover opening and closing several times over the years.  Maybe it was my fault for carrying it around in my pocket throughout the years maybe it's Canon's fault...I don't know but it did force me to get a new camera the ELPH 170.Size - I specifically like this camera for what it is - a small but powerful camera.  I have an SLR but to be honest it sits in the closet for the most part.  I don't want to be on vacation at a family event like a wedding or out with friends and have a big clunky camera.My brother once asked me when seeing me with my ELPH "Who still carries a separate camera when everyone has one on their phone?"  Well my answer to him was that phone cameras are great for their size but really as cameras they're not the greatest.  And this is why I like this size of camera.  It fits in a pocket and it takes excellent pictures.  12x zoom...dedicated camera...you'll get much better pictures than anyone else who is taking them with their phone and then you can simply stick it back in your pocket again.As far as specs you can compare them yourself but for me I remember the days of film and the early days of digital cameras.  The pictures I'm able to take today on a cheap camera with image stabilization and high resolution amaze me when I think of the past...but then I digress.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I really don't think you can go wrong buying a Canon or Nikon today but size is of importance to me and the size of this camera fits a nice balance between power and size.
