Fits perfectly and allows room for me to move around and such.  I ordered an xs for the navy blue and hunter green and I am 5'2" 32" bust 23" waist and 112 lbs.  The only thing that bothered me was it took me a little bit more time to take off the top but that could be because my shoulders are a little bit broad for my size since that's where I would struggle.  Overall I love the scrubs it's very comfy and roomie with very functional pockets and the navy blue and hunter green color is just like the picture.
