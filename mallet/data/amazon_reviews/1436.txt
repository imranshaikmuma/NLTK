This is my husband's second pair of these. He purchased a khaki pair several months ago and liked them so much that he wanted a black pair.Pros:They are a good fit and comfortable to wear. He can wear them to church a business meeting or out to dinner. They look nice with a sweater or with a dress shirt and sport coat. The material is thicker than most dress type of pants. They do well with not wrinkling. If I remove them straight from the dryer they do not require any ironing.Cons:The black pants do seem to attract lint I have to make sure to wash them only with dark colors. This helps to cut down on the lint. I have also found that a lint brush is helpful and the lint does come off easily. I believe it's the material these are made from. As long as you are careful what you wash them with it's not a huge issue.Conclusion:Overall we are pleased with these and would purchase them again.
