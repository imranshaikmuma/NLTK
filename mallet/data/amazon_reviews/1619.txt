This product as advertised is supposed create a tough water barrier on leather shoes. I bought a brand new pair of $150 Clarks leather boots and went to Kiwi as a trusted boot protector. After carefully following directions I applied to the booth the the appropriate distance and waited 48 hours to dry. The color of the brown booth has been COMPLETELY altered. A brand new pair of boots now looks like it has been through a war. ADDING photo soon***
