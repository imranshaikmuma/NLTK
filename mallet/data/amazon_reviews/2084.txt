This laptop has been everything that I expected.  Coming from a 17" ASUS ROG I wanted a smaller lighter laptop with the same power and I have not been disappointed.  I had been very satisfied with my ASUS and felt that an newer model would meet all my needs.  The ZenBook is extremely well built and much slimmer and lighter than the old beast.  I am a freelance photographer and often have the need to process images on location and transmit to clients to meet publishing deadlines.  The ability to quickly cull edit and transmit photos was a key requirement and this laptop has not missed a beat so far.While making a decision on which laptop to purchase I considered a 15" MacBook Pro.  However to get equivalent specs the Apple was very close to twice as expensive.  The 4K screen resolution is impressive and while I didn't need the touch screen I find it useful at times.  Overall I am very satisfied with my decision to purchase another ASUS product.
