100 % love my camera! especially the wifi function that you can see what the camera sees  on your screen and that you can basically control EVERYTHING from your phone when it comes to taking photos. also that you can view all the pics on the camera on your phone and download the ones you want to then upload on social media. its just fantastic. and the long lens that comes with the kit is amazing as well I'm really glad i chose to take the one with it.
