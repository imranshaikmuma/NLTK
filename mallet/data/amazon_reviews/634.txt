I'm a bit of a novice so some of you may know how to correct these things. Since the camera is so small the flash isn't the best. I was worried about the camera being hard to hold with it being so small but it's been fine.  Then again I do use the camera strap. I got some spotlighting effects when I take pictures with the flash.  If I don't use the flash especially inside the color is better but people need to be absolutely still or they get blurred.  I do like the HD video quite a bit but I don't have any HD video to compare it to. It's the first time I've been able to record at that level. I've used Picasa to try to download pictures from the camera and that works ok though Sony seems to suggest their own software. Charging the battery isn't the easiest but is ok. The price was cheaper than some of the other cameras I was considering. I think overall I had better luck with my old panasonic and will likely look that way next time if it has HD video.
