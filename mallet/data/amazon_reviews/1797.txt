We recently switched to all Navy or White uniforms at the hospital I work.  I wanted a jacket that was different than other I have and opted for the zip up "hoodie like" of this one.  It's Cherokee and you can't go wrong with them.  The Core Stretch line runs somewhat smaller than the standard but other than that  I get one size up.  ( I also like to wear t-shirts under tops and this afforded me the room I like and not have tight uniforms.  Again I do not like snug fitting clothes.  Shipping was Prime and received quickly in true Amazon fashion.
