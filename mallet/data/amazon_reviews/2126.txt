Hardware and software combine for a great experience. I had two HP Pavilions before switching to this Macbook Pro and I can honestly say I wouldn't go back. The HP's were both i7's and should have performed like such. Instead I got slow machines with low quality hardware. After constant driver issues and windows updates during the most inconvenient times I decided to make the jump and switch. The Macbook Pro is sleek and outperforms my previous Windows i7's dramatically while only having an i5. The software isn't that hard to get used to and it really is a treat to use. Everything opens instantly and shows no signs of slowing down. The controversy about the ports is blown way out of proportion too. One dongle and I can do everything I need on this amazing display. 4 stars because the price is hard to justify but I am really happy I bought this instead of a surface. The quality is amazing and something I am not used to.
