DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. The phone isn't "refurbished"- it's broken and unusable.I like the look and feel of the phone but it has *many* issues. I was upgrading from a 5s and the 6 seems like a great pick but this seller clearly is just turning over broken phones and not doing the whole "refurbishing" part...The first issue is that applications keep crashing while I’m using it. This isn’t constant but it’s happened multiple times with various games/browsers so I don’t like that.Another thing that’s even more annoying is that the volume doesn’t switch off. It pops back up to full volume immediately or on its own randomly. Even when it IS in the mute position the phone makes noise when getting texts or taking a photo. I stopped by the Apple store to make sure I wasn’t confused and the Genius Bar woman was concerned and confused as well. She said if the volume is switched to off the camera shutter should *not* make noise yet it does. This is a nightmare at work when getting emails and texts. It's very loud and annoying and this is embarrassing. It doesn’t stay in the mute position it constantly slides back up. But even while it’s still in the mute position it doesn’t mute the sounds.There is a new problem as of today which is that it keeps saying my sent texts are undelivered with the red exclamation but then people respond to them. So I never know if something went through or not.The final thing that’s been “off” is that the screen sometimes gets wavy which I’ve never experienced before in a phone. The first time this happened I was taking a photo through a window so I didn’t think about it much and just assumed it was something to do with the glass. But it’s happened a few times now while I’m texting or on Facebook. I don’t even know why it would do thisI was expecting a used but perfect condition phone. This one clearly has some issues and it’s not functioning as promised.
