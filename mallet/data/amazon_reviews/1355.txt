This is an absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry!  I purchased it to give to my daughter for Christmas.  I'm sure she'll love it.  I told my brother about it and described it to him and added what a great value it was.  He asked me to order one for his wife for Christmas.  So I did but he didn't get the same (awesome) price that I did.  When I told him he said he didn't care.  It arrived a few days ago; and he was amazed at how beautiful it is and cannot wait to give it to his wife; he's sure she'll love it.I am not sure why but the heart was larger than I though it would be-it is a truly stunning piece of jewelry.  I am so glad I bought it.
