I love it!  Very powerful zoom sharp focus and easy to shoot.  It's a little big and heavy but this made it steadier for me to compose my shots especially those with horizontal alignments.  My only negative comment is that it doesn't have a center indicator or I haven't figured it out yet.  But overall I'm satisfied.  I got the red one and it looks very cool!
