I am just gonna list the pros and cons of this $11 shirt.Pros;It's cheapThe pattern is nearly identical the actual MARPATThe sizing is relatively realistic I would say going a size up won't hurt.Great for wearing over other (warmer) clothes during airsoft paintball hunting etc.Cons;The material feels very cheapThe shirt fits great but the sleeve cuffs are strangely tightThis is not a warm shirt whatsoever it is paper thinThe color looks like it will fade fast I washed it once so far alone on cold/cold setting on the cotton/normal setting and it hasn't faded.It probably contains 600000000000000000 chemicals that will slowly kill youHey but for the price I must say I like this. I was considering real USMC MARPAT surplus/used but for the time being Rothco will do. If you are using this for airsoft or really anything wear it over a thicker shirt. For example in 45* (Fahrenheit) weather I wear a warm wool olive drab jacket and then I slip this over. The color blends well with the jacket and I get the warmth and feel of the jacket. I would also recommend you go a size higher and only buy one shirt at time... shipping is free order it to see if you like it before you buy 4 shirts and complain that they didn't fit.Overall 4/5 stars because of the cheap quality and material.
