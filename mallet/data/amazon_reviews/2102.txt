The product itself is more than I could ever have expected at this price.  Fast startup bright clear display tactical full size keyboard.  Very well constructed.  The only issue was that the product arrived in a plain box.  Chrome book and power supply ... not an HP box.  Just a plain brown box with foam padding.  That surprised. me.  But the device works.
