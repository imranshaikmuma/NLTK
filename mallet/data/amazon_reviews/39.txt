I purchased this video bundle because it definitely seemed like the best deal at the time. Because it is essentially two separate products I am going to split the reviews.Canon T5i:Wonderful camera. It feels good in the hand and is very straight forward (and this is coming from an ex-Nikon guy). The touch screen is really neat but I don't use it a whole lot. The lens is a standard lens and should be expected to perform like one. The manual is also really straight forward but does lack some simple details such as how to attach the strap to the camera body. Though this isn't a difficult task it still would be nice to have in there for beginners. The camera is really what you would expect. It shoots wonderful photos with unlimited options when it comes to manual settings of aperture ISO or shutter speed. It is also very easy to change the video settings all with great resolution. It is also very easy for a rookie to figure these settings out just by playing around with it. It has a sturdy build and overall is a great purchase.Rode Videomic Go:The selling point for this set to me was really the microphone. The microphone is easy to attach to the mount and requires no batteries. It has no buttons and runs completely off of the camera which makes it very easy to use. I found two downsides to the mic and they are as follows. First of all the cable that runs between the mic and camera tends to get in the way a bit. There is a small slot on the mic shock mount that holds the cable back but it still seems to fall on to the screen of the camera. The second issue came to the actual mic sound itself. It does a great job of picking up sounds in the room including the lower range but it does seem to have a bit of a hissing in the back. It's not super noticeable but it is definitely there. Other than the cable and the white noise this is a great starter kit for videos on any DSLR. Comes with everything you need to get going.
