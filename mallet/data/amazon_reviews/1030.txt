This is a great phone. It is the same size as the iPhone 5/5s and shares the same cases. It has almost identical specs to the iPhone 6s. The main difference between the SE and 6s is that the SE does not have an upgraded front facing camera or the 3D touch capability. The SE has incredible battery life and the 12mp rear camera is a good improvement. Perfect phone for someone who wants to have more speed and performance with a smaller screen.
