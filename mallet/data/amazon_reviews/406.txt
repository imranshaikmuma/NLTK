Amazon shows camera with an SD card but no SD slot. Software would not download into Windows 10. Display is fuzzy and colors are overly bright and not realistic. Polaroid had no support for this camera. And apparently no support except by email for ANY product. Went online to see if I could find driver to download but 3 different ones from different sites didn't work. Perhaps if you had an old computer software might work.
