The Sony HX90V offers great functionality and a nice shooting experience but ultimately even considering its sensor size image quality falls short with detail smearing down at the lowest ISOs when blown up to anything larger than web size photos.While I realize that they have decreased the MP slightly on this model I still think 18MP is way too much for a camera with a 1/2.3" sensor. I kind of feel for an enthusiast-oriented megazoom they should've gone with something like 12MP like Panasonic did for its Lumix ZS50. Detail smearing due to noise reduction is visible at reduced sizes at base ISO. Most pedestrian point and shoot cameras these days should at least be able to give you the ability to blow up your prints at ISO100. RAW capture is also not available on this model which is unfortunate because you can customize the level of noise reduction applied and potentially get better photos than what they out of camera JPEGs display.To balance this out color and exposure are pretty good. The camera doesn't blow out highlights as badly as some of its peers.It's unfortunate that image quality falls short because otherwise this is a nice camera to use. The autofocus is fast and mostly on target. The image stabilization works well. And the viewfinder is actually very nice despite being a lower resolution than the ones found in the RX100 series cameras. Battery life is also pretty good. The LCD screen on back is pretty good as well.I have not shot with the Panasonic ZS50 so I can't really comment on overall image quality compared to this camera but the fact that you can shoot RAW gives it a leg up over the Sony. If you never really blow up your photos at all then this might be an alright choice. But if you at least want to make larger prints from images at base ISO in good light I would look elsewhere.
