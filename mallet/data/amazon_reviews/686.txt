So I did a lot of research before pre-ordering the Moto G 4th Generation. Many reviewers felt it to be an outstanding mid-range device but one or two did mention overheating issues due to the phone's Snapdragon 617 chipset. Swayed by the "best budget phone ever made" reviews and the amazing(!) deal on Amazon I decided to take a chance.I received the phone on its release day July 12. My first thought upon opening the box was "It's beautiful!" I loved the size display expandable memory etc. But almost right away the phone got VERY hot. Researching a little more I read that smartphones may get hot during the initial set up because of all the downloading and what not so I thought I'd keep tabs on the issue over the next few days.I noticed that the phone kept getting hot with just a few minutes of doing anything even just browsing the internet so yesterday I decided to install an app that would help detect overheating. This morning after about 10 minutes of playing Soda Crush the phone registered 107.1 degrees Fahrenheit. After letting the phone cool down for half-an-hour I used the phone to read some news stories online. The phone then registered 105.2 degrees. The ambient temperature was 78 degrees.The "solution" posted on the Moto/Lenovo forums is hardly helpful [...] as I'm not in the middle of heatwave. I'm not using the phone with a case and none of the other situations apply.Aside from the heat issue the phone is fine. The overheating hasn't caused any performance problems as far as I can tell. I don't know if I got a dud. A search of the Amazon reviews for "heat" or "hot" came back with only 8-10 results. I'm debating whether or not I should return or exchange the Moto g. I'm torn because I like the phone otherwise and would rather not pay more than double or triple for a different phone. :(
