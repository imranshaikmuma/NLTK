Just a dream of a camera. Slightly larger than micro four thirds premium bodies of Olympus or Panasonic and slightly smaller than Sony's A7 series of full frame cameras. The camera feels like a tool that you will want to go out and shoot with. Control layout and its ergonomics are superb while the output of the files are astounding. No more worries about the issues with X Series cameras with poor autofocus greatly improved continuous autofocus and the speed has vastly improved. Someone that has shot with mirrorless for years trying micro four thirds in many iterations aps-c mirrorless systems as well as the Sony mirrorless full frames Fuji continues to draw me in. The Fuji X-T2 is a versitile piece of grear that will be your go to all purpose camera. I extensively do street and travel photography where it's just a joy to use. Wifi works well for Instagram though the files do take a bit of time to transfer. Instagram: thedharmalife
