At first I had issues with the camera but figured it out all without reading a thing. Yes it was both simple and complex at the same time. A little playing around in the app will get you a long way! Reading the instructions though may actually help as well.Do I like it? I love the motion and sound alerts. I love that is is capable of recording clips when motion is sensed. I love that I can and have inserted a card into it and I am using it to take time lapse video of the day while i am away. The time lapse has even let me see and know that the ChemLawn guy isn't really treating the entire yard but just spots here and there - as i had thought. Too bad for him. Time to call the boss and complain again about the service.I liked this camera so much I went out to bestbuy and purchased their alarm system. The ones at bestbuy are a little differently packaged in that their system includes a spot camera. Now i have two of them and an alarm. A review for the alarm will be forthcoming and if the interaction of the camera and alarm causes any issues I'll be back here to update this review of the spot camera.
