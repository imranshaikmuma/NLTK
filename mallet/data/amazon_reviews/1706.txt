If you are old enough to remember real bandana handkerchiefs you will be disappointed. Even after washing they are very thin and stiff. The pattern is not part of the fabric but is printed on with stiff ink. Not very nice to actually use for the original intended purpose. I am just considering chucking these or passing on to the Salvation Army. Live and learn.
