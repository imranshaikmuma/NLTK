Had this for a week.  Have had many gaming laptops over the last 10 years.  This one works as good as advertised. Very please with it and certainly priced well for what it is capable of.  Will highly suggest for any gamer though.  Go with the ssd.  ssd vs hdd is like comparing day to night.  Mine came with the hdd and I upgraded to ssd.Update.  I noticed it felt a little warmer than usual after playing Guild Wars 2  I reduced the graphics in the game to low and set the fps to  no more than 30  I also have this on a chill pad with 3 fans.  Sometimes it would over heat and shut down at random and sometimes it wouldn't.  But we all know if it starts over heating now after less than 2 weeks it will only get worse. I am returning this to Amazon. Wanting a replacement.  I love the design and was very happy with this laptop.  I hope it was just a fluke and they can either repair or replace and it doesn't over heat again.  Will update again once I have a different one.  If the over heating issue is resolved. I will certainly recommend this.  If it is not resolved of course I cannot.  I am still giving it 5 stars.  Very impressed with the design and how light it is.
