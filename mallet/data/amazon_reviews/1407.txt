A better design than the previous model and seems to be holding up better in the wash. The leg length seems ever so slightly longer than the last version of FotL boxer briefs which is better for the leg cuffs staying put and not needing adjustment throughout the day.  These also don't lose shape over the course of the day as some previous models have. They stay snug and the cotton breathes well. A nice upgrade on the waistband as well. Will be picking up more of these.
