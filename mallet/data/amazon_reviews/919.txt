This phone is just okay.  It's not very intuitive...maybe just because I'm so used to a smart phone.  This is the only reason I could come up with to ding my review rating to 4 stars.  I really only bought this phone as a pay-as-you-go phone to allow me to port my home number to this phone and then to a GoogleVoice #.  I did play with the phone for the few days it took to get things all ported over between different services.  I had to use it to answer several calls with our home number.  The sound was pretty good.  No complaints there.  It was just like any other phone I have had before I got a smart phone.  Overall for the price of this phone it is a GREAT Deal.The whole phone is really just plastic and the back seems kind of cheap but hey...what can you complain about when you only pay $18 for a cell phone.  My kids don't have a cell phone and I certainly don't intend to give them a smart phone.  I do plan to hold onto this phone as I contemplate allowing my kids to have a pay-as-you-go phone for emergencies.  This is great as a starter phone for them.This phone does have FM radio available.  That's kind of cool.  It's WAY too easy to turn it on accidentally and if you're not used to it it's hard to figure out how to turn it off.  That happened when I took it in to the phone provider to activate it.  We spent the next 10 minutes pushing buttons trying to turn it off.  I'm sure you'd get used to this if you used it regularly.I didn't add any photos as I think the photos in the listing are quite sufficient.Oh one other thing...I wish it came with a manual.  Not a big deal I guess as I was able to locate it online.  Some of the buttons aren't labeled or in intuitive locations which kind of made it hard for me to figure it out at first.
