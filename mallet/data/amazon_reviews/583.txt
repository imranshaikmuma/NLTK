I would not recommend this camera. Type this into Google and read the forums " RX100 buzzing"My camera started buzzing for no reason after a year of course after the warranty ran out. I had it on a tripod taking pictures of dear on my deck when it started buzzing. People report this issue after a few days few weeks and in my case a year. Very unreliable and the camera has even been recalled in japan from what some people were saying.Very disappointed in Sony. Waste of $650
