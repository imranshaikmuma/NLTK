These yoga pants are my absolutely favorite! I'm 110lbs and 5'6 1/2 but most of my height is in my legs so I wear the same length pants as someone who's 5'8. I usually buy my yoga pants from target (XS) but the length is not as long as I like so I have to stretch them out wverytime I wash them. Eventually this leaves holes in the material from stretching them so much and I have to buy new ones. I wear a size XS long in Victoria secret and even those require stretching after I send them through dryer. These pants are the first to fit my leg length perfectly! They are also more flared at the bottom so they don't make my feet look as big! The hug your thighs and flare out a little below your knee cap. I'm obsessed! I purchased 2 black and will be purchasing more of other colors now. I'm attaching a picture of the band pulled all the way up as well as the band folded down like I usually wear them. The black ones i'm wearing are a size small. I also ordered them only 4 days ago. Awesome shipping time!
