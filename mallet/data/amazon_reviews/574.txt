I recently purchased my second RE camera within 14 months. The first one developed 2 small cracks at the bottom of the camera. Suddenly it would not turn on. I noticed these during using it with their extra waterproof accessory cap in a wave pool on vacation. The camera was ruined. HTC refused to help since it was 1 month out of warranty (13 months). They claim that I physically damaged it. The camera has never been dropped. The cracks just developed over time. I researched the camera on Amazon reviews and found others claiming the same thing: cracks developed with no dropping of the camera.I really enjoyed the camera and decided to purchase another. I had already purchased the additional waterproof cap/bottom a case and many memory cards so I thought to give it a try again.  On this purchase I bought the extra warranty.  Well I just came back from vacation and while there I noticed a crack in the SAME AREA. The camera works but after finding the crack I was not about to try it in water. Again I have NOT dropped the camera.HTC appears not to recognize a problem with their product. 2 cameras and similar cracks that others also have reported?? It's about time that they address this and not assume that users  have caused the damage by carelessly dropping the camera.Produce a quality product......BEWARE!!
