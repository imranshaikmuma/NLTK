I was on the fence about buying pants online because I have never done it before. I finally ended up buying a pair of these pants and it was a 50 50 split. I like the pants they are very durable and they look professional. On the other hand they did not fit as well as I hoped. I have not been to a store to buy pants for quite sometime but I normally get 30-32. I ordered 31-32 just to be safe because i am picky on how cloths fit me. There is nothing worse than wearing pants that squeeze at your waist all day long. Anyways I got the pants in the mail (a day later than it said but that's no biggie) and I tried them on. The length was good and the fit around the legs and all was good but the waist was a bit too tight. I mean its not like I have gained that much weight sense I last bought pants! Now I still wear them I just wear a belt and don't button them. I did have to wash them once or twice with a decent amount of softer because they were very stiff when I got them. overall I like the product just not the fit.
