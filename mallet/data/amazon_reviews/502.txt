So this is a waterproof camera. It is designed to take pictures outside in and around water. It is not for taking classy portraits. If you are looking for a fun easy-to-use water camera for taking pictures of your family at the pool or lake or amateur snorkeling pictures this seems to be a great choice. If you are a professional photographer looking for a top-of-the-line underwater National-Geographic camera then this is not what you are looking for. This is great for the price. Only used it once but had a blast.
