The things I am satisfied:- This phone is beautiful. Honestly I love looking at this phone and I find myself wiping down the phone to maintain it's reflective dark reflection.- Stunning display. Impressive 5.1 QHD AMOLED display is beautiful and vibrant. It's largely the same as the S6 but that's not a bad thing.- Camera has a great rear camera compared to the S6. Even though the megapixels have been reduced to 12 it has a much better sensor and takes great photos in low-light environments. It auto-focuses super quickly so you can take pictures as quickly as you can pull up the camera app. - 3000mAh battery is like having a phone + battery case without actually having the thick battery case. Hard to kill that battery in a day. And it comes with the fast Qi charge technology which is charged from 0% to 50% in 30mins only!- Always on mode constantly displays notifications without the need to unlock the phone. - Water resistant. IP68 rated which means the phone can be totally submerged in water up to 1.5m deep and 30 minutes.  - up to 128Gb Micro SD expandable memoryThe things Samsung have to improve:  - Not removable battery pack. 3000mAh is not enough for a busy day. - No USB-type C so it's not future proof but then again the lifetime of the phone is 1-2 years.- Only 32GB storage. But you can overcome this with micro-SD storage.- Dual sims function: you have to remove the micro-sd card for the sim 2 otherwise there is no any other slot for sim2.  - I am using T-mobile the speed of LTE of the dual sims international version is very not stable and slow than the one I used on my iphone 6s GSM unlocked ver.- For some reason my phone doesn't always recongnize my fingerprints. I've reset them a couple times and it still doesn't always read it correctly. My iphone6s had fingerprint readers and its quicker or more accurate than the S7
