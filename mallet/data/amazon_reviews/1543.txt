Perfect shoes.. But I do recommend getting a half size larger.. I'm usually an 8 ( and that's what I got) and even though they aren't small.. I def need that extra half in room for my toes.. But I'm a bartender so I'm constantly on my feet and they were very comfortable and even without that extra half inch breathing room.. They were fine and definitely got the job done.. These are exactly what I was looking for
