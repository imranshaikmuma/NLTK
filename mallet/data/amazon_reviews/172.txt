I’ve been waiting awhile to post a review of the Fuji XT2. I received it from Amazon mid Sept. and have been using it since. I do mostly flowers and travel photo/video and make BluRay videos of them using Apples Final Cut Pro. In Hawaii I did photo comparisons of my Canon 5DIII with all L lenses and the Fuji. The Fuji with its stock 18-55 lens beat the Canon hands down. The images were sharper with better colors (standard setting). In the Vivid mode the colors were remarkable. I think the difference in sharpness is due to the lack of an Optical Low Pass Filter. Traveling with the Fuji system vs. the Canon is so much easier due to size and weight.For the video side of things I have been using a Canon HF G30 camcorder shooting 1080 59.9P. I just did a comparison of the cam and the Fuji at 1080P. I shot extremely low light to check the noise level and daylight for color saturation and clarity of image. Again the Fuji shined much less noise in low light and sharper images with better colors in daylight. I haven’t tried 4K since all my videos are 1080P BluRay. One drawback to the Fuji is that shooting 1080P you’re limited to 15 minutes per clip unless you attach the battery grip with extra batteries. I never used the 5DIII for Video since it won’t auto focus as you are shooting. Speaking of auto focusing the Canon HF G30 does a little better job of staying on focus as the subject moves around. Also the built in mic is really good on the G30 whereas the built in on the Fuji is “muddy”. You really need a good external mic with the Fuji.All things considered the Fuji XT2 is a remarkable achievement at a bargain price. I have since purchased the 55-200 and the 10-24. They are also great!Henrik Hansen DDS
