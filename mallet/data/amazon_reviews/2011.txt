What's there to say? It's a MacBook Pro and the last good model Apple made. It has actual USB 3.0 ports the MagSafe charger illuminated apple logo sd card reader HDMI port etc. The force trackpad is nice to use and eerily convincing with its click simulation. It feels just like the old style but you can click anywhere on the pad. I only hope by the time this computer dies Apple will have corrected their current gen mistakes.
