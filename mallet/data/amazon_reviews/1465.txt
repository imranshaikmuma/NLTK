4 of 5 stars because of price. I'm 5'1" 120 lbs with large hips. I purchased all petite sizes; at first "M" due to some of the reviews about running large but don't listen to them. The "M" was so big I had to return and thought I couldn't be a "S" and ordered the "XS". The "XS" is for a person with no thighs because it was all extremely snug; no way could I be comfortable running around in snug scrubs. I then ordered "S" and it was the right fit! Amazon made the returning/refunding process very smooth and expedient.I love the random yellow accents with the loops to hang stuff off of and the multitude of large and small pockets all over the place. There are also yellow mesh pockets here and there that are nice for jewelry to stay snug within. The pocket on the right upper thigh side has a nice big pocket for a large cell phone like I have. The only problem is my cell phone is kind of heavy and it drags the pants down.The height of the pants for my 5'1" frame is perfect. With sneakers the pants just barely misses the floor.The material is not lint-resistant and clings to a lot of thread.
