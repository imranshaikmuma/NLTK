My husband is an Art Professor and teaches print making and other 2 dimensional art classes.  He can dress business casual and could wear jeans but feels that they aren't very professional looking and yet he doesn't want to wear slacks.  We have bought him these Carhartt dungarees before and he absolutely loves them!He loves the quality of the fabric--it's sturdy and thick like jeans can be yet it's not too hot.He love the pockets on the front side and back.  And it's so hard for him to find pants that fit him as he's tall and slender--weighs 170 and is 6'2".  Going to department stores is just futile.  Department stores rarely have his size in stock and looking for his size is like looking for a needle in a haystack.These are awesome in every way.  They're easy to wash and dry and fold without any wrinkles.  It would take more than 5 years of wearing these for the fabric to get threadbare.He's reluctant to buy these for himself as he shops bargains but everyone in the family now knows these are his favorites.I highly recommend them!
