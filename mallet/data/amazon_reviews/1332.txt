So when buying I really didnt even notice these were intended and made for nurses/people in the medical industry. I was just looking for a quality basic cotton long sleeve shirt at a great rate and these are certainly that. I think its made with shorter arms for that reason being it doesn't get in the way of nurses or doctors while working but for me I do have longer arms and I like my sleeves to be even longer so that would be the only fault but again its my fault for not noticing the kind of shirt it was. Ohherwise feels nice I ordered 3 colors grey white and purple in size Medium and they fit perfect arrived right on time as well.
