I bought 2 of these for my middle and high school age kids. They are very happy with the performance and functionality. They use them A LOT for school and gaming and have no problem at all with glitching/buffering.  My daughter takes it to school everyday in her backpack and for the price I'm not freaked about her dropping it. The graphics are very nice and the keyboard feels great under your fingertips. I would highly recommend this laptop and would buy it again in a heartbeat. It also had a CD drive which is harder to find these days.
