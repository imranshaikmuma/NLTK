This camera in every sense delivers what is expected.  The camera is light weight with easy setup and start up.  The zoom is truly remarkable and allows clear image.  The smartbridge access allows pictures to transfer to your mobile device with minimal interaction.  The Smartbridge application is free and requires an email and personal data to setup.  The Wifi and Bluetooth functions work well to connect your camera with mobile devices. I love to take pictures and own several cameras from the very professional to using cell phone.  Overall I would recommend the purchase of this camera.
