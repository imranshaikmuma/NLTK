Amazing APS-C camera. I have been a Pentax DSLR user for many years and upgraded to the K-3 II from a K200D and couldn't be happier. While I loved the 200D this camera is light years ahead in every way. Very rugged excellent build quality and fit and finish amazing features and lots of buttons means less fumbling around in various menus. A GPS receiver replaces a built-in flash but that is ok I use an external flash anyway and the GPS is very helpful if you want to return to that perfect spot. Excellent camera and great price!
