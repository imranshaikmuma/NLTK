Before purchasing the HX90V I compared against all similar cameras I was attracted to the WIFI small dimensions zoom EVF Viewfinder the pop up flash the rotating (selfie) LCD screen. Before purchasing I read positive reviews and noted the complaints. I found that this camera may not be right for persons that don't have refined touch or handle items roughly. The pop-up EVF flash and USB port cover could be easily broken if handled roughly. Some buttons are small to locate and feel. I noticed the plastic case comments about the camera. I can't say it would be a problem for longevity but didn't think it has a cheaply made look or feel. Plastic does changes over time and I'm hoping it will give me at least 5 years of service. After some photo taking WIFI connecting and feature tests I found the camera very satisfactory. Regarding accessories I bought the Sony screen protector PCKLM15 and found it easy to install. The Sony fitted case LCJHWA does have a nice quality to it. This light compact camera suits my needs for a camera that is easy to bring along and take nice photos.
