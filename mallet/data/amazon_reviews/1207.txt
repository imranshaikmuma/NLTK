It ran a little big on me. I'm 5'2 125 lbs and usually wear a small. It is a very pretty color and the material is soft. The bottoms are a little strange and the string goes from the front to the back so it runs right down the middle of your lady parts. It isn't intolerable though. Also I wasn't expecting this to be a halter top that you tie. I'm glad it was and all my fellow small chested ladies will be too. Overall it's cute and I'll definitely be wearing it.
