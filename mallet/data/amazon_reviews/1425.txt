I was very nervous of what I purchased after I read the reviews and after I had already paid for it. I ordered the Dark Brown/ Sandstone color. I recevied my order yesterday and it had the correct color and shape for the logo and the actual tags from Carhartt attached on top. It was brand new and NOT a fake. Im guessing maybe popular colors like black may be easier to fake?? Mine came from Amazon.com as the vendor.
