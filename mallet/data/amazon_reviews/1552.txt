I LOVED these shoes when they came in. However I bought a half a size up due to reading other reviews as I sometimes go between an 8 and 8.5. That being said I sadly had to return and reorder an 8 which was a bummer because I wanted to wear them right away!! So comfy and cute. Really excited for my new pair to come in
