I use this for tons of my youtube adventures! From facecam ofgaming videos to longboarding  sailing (with a waterproof casing)  to wonderful night sky and beach shots! So far my only tiff with this camera is that i cant record over 30 min. Straight withough it stopping the recording sadly. Other then that its been super easy to use and learn on as my first real camera. You can connect it to your pc and use it as a web cam through the canon software from the website which i find is super cool and it makes moving video and pictures off of it super easy as well.
