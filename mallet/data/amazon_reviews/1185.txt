This review is more about the color than the jacket itself.  i had one in black that i loved but left it at a hotel and couldn't get it back.  i ordered a replacement in black but the one I received is gray not black.  I couldn't find anything on the label and packaging indicating what color it is so I'm not sure if this is their idea of black or what.  The one I had was absolutely black and that is what I wanted.  It's too much trouble to send it back so I'm keeping the gray jacket but I'm very disappointed with it and don't know how much I'll even really wear it.  If you are looking for black as I was don't order this one that is listed as "black".
