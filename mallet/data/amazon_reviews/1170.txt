I had a feeling I would be disappointed but I laughed this shirt was so wrong. I got an xxl because of the other comments. I am 5'7 and 135lbs. It fit but the cut of this shirt bulges in the wrong places (like the shoulders and hips) and still didn't come close to fitting like the model shown. I wanted a baggy fit but only the arms were baggy which looked weird against the fitted waist. Also the sleeves weren't the pretty colors shown (was this photo enhanced?) and the fabric is thin and scratchy like it was made of plastic. Returning.
