The cameras are useless from a security perspective: I am unable to view them from anywhere outside of my home wifi network range.  As a result they are only really useful if I'm in my house which makes no sense for a security system.  I contacted customer support several weeks ago and although at the time they responded with a link to a beta app that app was no better than the current version and since then I've heard nothing back.  I'm planning to return them at this point.
