I use to buy these pants at JCPenney but lately their prices have been going out-of-this-world on these pants so I started searching on-line and ended up landing at Amazon.I like the fact that they include a hidden expandable waist line under the belt area by the front pockets.  If you go out for a big lunch you will love the concept.  Plus the pants always feel perfect after putting them on as they will either contract a little or expand a little throughout the day as needed.Quality is good.  I wear these pants every day at work.  I use to wear Dockers until I found these.  I prefer the appearance compared to the Dockers as well as the fact that they have a button instead of metal clip to hold them closed in addition to the expandable waist for a perfect fit and appearance every time.Comfortable material and durable.  I usually but an assortment of these every fall and wear them daily at work.  I hesitate to make them sound too good as I don't want the prices to go up.
