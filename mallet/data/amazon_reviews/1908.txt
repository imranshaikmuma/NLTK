The wife complains it's slow compared to her work laptop but I don't see that as a problem.  Can't beat the price for a computer that will be used for MS Office and internet browsing only; Videos from YouTube or MS Edge worked fine with some hiccups when there's 2 open streaming videos; Battery lasted a few hours with normal use; lightweight thin body.  One problem I see years from now would be broken screen hinges.  It closes tight on the hinges and this was a problem with my old Dell laptop.  After 6 years it broke off at one of the hinges and a few months later - no more screen display.  But then that one lasted 6 years so I'm hoping this new one will too.
