The black Double Front Carhartt Double Front jeans were a gift for my sons 14th birthday. I was a bit worried they would be "seconds" and not of good quality for the price. There was NO need to worry.  These Carhartts are top of the line and not seconds. They were true to size and fit my son perfectly. My husband only wears Carhartts Double Front jeans which have all been purchased locally in our small town. Ranging from $58-$70+sales tax. The label on local bought Carhartts say Made In Mexico. Each pair of my husbands locally bought Carhartts all fit differently even though they are the same style & size.This pair of Carhartts from Amazon are of better quality and has a label of "Made In The USA" on the waistband. I am extremely pleased with these Carhartts. This was my first ever purchase from Amazon & I couldn't be happier with the quality sizing price and prompt delivery. I will be buying all of my husbands Carhartts from Amazon in the future.
