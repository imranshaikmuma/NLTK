These are a good pair of pants for work. I honestly wouldn't wear them to a nice place but they are comfortable and fit as expected. They do tend to get little white lint all over them even before you put them on.EDIT:I have only worn these pants for about a month at this point. I wear these at work only for about 12-20 hours a week. In this time they already have produced a hole in the taint area from simply walking around. Don't know if it's because I have thunder thighs or what haha but no other pants have ever done this within a month.
