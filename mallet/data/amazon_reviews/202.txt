WowBought this camera as a replacement for a D90 mainly for astrophotography work.No low pass filter allows the sensor to gather more of the spectrum. The ring nebula showed it's multi-colored hues in a 30 second exposure on the D90 it was monochromatic. Still has good electronics to allow use in the brightest of conditions.The image detail is fantastic. The only problem is going to be storage space as the files are double the size of the D90.Controls are familiar to anyone using a Nikon built in the last couple of decades being pretty much the same except for the Selection Dials (PSAM) on the left there are two of them and they are stacked both requiring a release to be actuated before thaey can be turned. A little tricky for arthritic fingers.Able to use all my D90 lenses so I didn't have to reinvest in another infrastructure to remain flexible in my shooting choices.The retailer was fantastic as always don't get caught up in the super discount .sites that are trying to sell Grey Market as American Market (Warrantable) cameras.
