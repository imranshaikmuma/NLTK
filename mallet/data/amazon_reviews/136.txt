I got into photography about two years ago. I had been an avid photographer when I was younger in the Navy..back in the days of 35mm film with your choice of ISO...I think it was ASA back then-and my camera of choice was Pentax. I digress...I originally purchased a Pentax K50 and absolutely love that camera...but...when I get into something I always go overboard and want the best. The K50 had limitations and I kept looking at the K 3. The K 3 II came out and I couldn’t resist. It is a great piece of equipment and I don’t think anyone will be disappointed if they get one. Versatile comfortable ergonomics and a matte black and rubberised finish. I like that it does not have a pop-up flash...I have very seldom been satisfied with the results of using a pop up flash. This also has no programmed settings such as “beach” “portrait” “pets” etc... forcing you to learn how to set up your camera manually to get the best shots. It does have a “green” setting-which is quite like “auto”.  Compatible with all my Pentax DSLR lenses. Love it....
