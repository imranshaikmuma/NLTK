This top was purchased for a "look" and it succeeded at that. I am 5'9" and weigh 198 lbs with a sizable belly and this shirt was a decent fit in regard to sleeve length the fit across the stomach and the length past the waistline. The rating was dropped one star because of the falsehood of the shirt being 100% polyester. It almost seems as though I should be able to cut out a 12" square and use as a product that is a mild abrasive on one side and a super absorbent material on the reverse side. Because of that I'm not comfortable with is the "feel" of the shirt. I've only worn once for a few hours and will be careful not to allow my wife to dry it after it gets washed because she only knows one way to dry...high temperature and 60 minutes. I'm afraid that she will destroy it. If the color fades I'll be back with an update.
