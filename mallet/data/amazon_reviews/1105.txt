Just got these today - ordered Small size they are tight/snug but comfortable for leggings (i don't expect leggings to be loose so these are just right). I am 5'2" 127 lbs. thick thighs/butt but small waist they're definitely snug but will probably stretch with more wear and i can do lunges/squats in them comfortably without having too readjust them too much. The pattern is absolutely AWESOME! I actually like these so much I just ordered another 2 pairs (a 2nd in this pattern - horoscope/black and white galaxy like print) and another in the multicolor pattern. 100% satisfied. These leggings rock! Oh...and I didn't notice any "see-through" issues either. UPDATE: The Print 137 Feather Mixed Vivid S  COLORED pattern DOES run a bit small. I would suggest ordering the next size up if you're ordering the Feather Mixed Vivid color.
