From the pair I received it seems the sizes are a little smaller then what the other shorts I've gotten from them are. I ordered @ different style shorts 3 of one type and 1 of the 13 inch loose fit multi-pocket work pants. The other 3 fit as expected from other purchases (size 30). These Blue shorts were ordered as a size 30 as well but are much more snug. Perhaps the 30W may have been better fitting but all the other shorts I've bought from Dickies have been a regular 30 size.\. Make sure you read the description after you select your size as it will change to tell you more specific details about the pair you are choosing. I say this because I noticed people complaining about them receiving hook and eye vs. button tops.
