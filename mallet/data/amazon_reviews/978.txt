I am one of those people who is not into paying exhorbitant amounts of money for a phone. All of my previous phones have been my siblings hand me downs and this is the first I ever purchase for myself. Me being me I researched everywhere for what kind of phone will serve my purposes. Mostly I was aming for excellent camera that could photograph everything I have to show my coworkers later and also had a great reception for making and receiving calls in all seven floors of the hospital.This phone delivered.Not only am I super please with its performance at almost everything but I am amazed that one such phone can cost this price. And it has a high end finish and the gold color make it look amazing. Compared to my sister's iPhone 6 I'd say it almost does everything she can do with hers. It's light and sophisticated and has a quick response at everything I've done so far. Even better than hers is that this one holds two SIMs which works perfectly with my life as I love to travel. So far I've tested two of my international SIMs and they both worked great.It's also my first android phone ever as I'd previously only used the iOS softwares I was expecting a nightmare. It wasn't. It wasn't also exactly breezy but the phone is not to blame for that. Also I was pleasently surprised with the amount of apps you can get.The only thing though is get an SD card. No matter how little you think you need it you're going to need it.
