I was sent the wrong item/style but given the arrival date and the fact it was intended as an Xmas gift I went ahead and gifted it with an explanation to the recipient.  He tried it on and decided it would work just fine despite the fact it wasn't exactly the style I'd sought out.  So we're all happy! And frankly I think the mis-sent style actually looks better on him than the one ordered (which I had ordered because it was the same style as an older much loved and worn Carhartt jacket and I knew giving it up would be hard!)
