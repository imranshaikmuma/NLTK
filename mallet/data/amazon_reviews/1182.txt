This jacket is amazingly soft and perfect for the fall/winter seasons. At first I was worried the jacket might be a little too big after reading some comments claiming the size was bigger then they had expected I was also worried after I had ordered it the colors might be a little too kiddish and not look so great with my skin tone. But the size is perfect ! I'm 5'4 150lbs and this fits just right. Not too big not too small! And the colors are adorable. They don't wash me out or make me look like I'm 12.
