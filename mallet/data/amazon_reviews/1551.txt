The shoe looks great but there is no support at all. I have inserts from the podiatrist that give sole support but they raise my foot just high enough to make the show unstable for anything more than running errands. Get a different shoe if you need them for any kind of exercise. They work fine if you just want to look like you've been exercising. ;)
