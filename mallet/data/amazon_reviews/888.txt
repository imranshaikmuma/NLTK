I am surprised by this phone. The performance is outstanding at the level of any flagship phone (Samsung S7 iPhone 7 & LG V20) the camera pictures are as good as an iPhone 7. Battery duration is better than an iPhone 7 and to my ZTE Axon 7.I purchased this phone for my work phone number and I also have the ZTE Axon 7 (which is way  much superior in performance) but the design of this phone is gorgeous adding that its performance is flawless.Highly recommended!BTW: It has 2 Nano SIM Card slots but the secondary slot can be used for adding a MicroSD Card.
