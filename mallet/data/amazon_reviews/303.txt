Just got the cam this morning so far I really like it  I think the best automatic true 360 degree cam on the market I used a lot other cameras before so I  can see the difference  it truly cover 360 degree up and down.The still resolution is nice however I am getting some chromatic aborations on the white parts of the elements in photo  I tried also to make HDRI however got some app issue  it lose connection with  the WiFi at distance of 15 feet   I tried to hide from the pic  behind the car .Also the objects in distance are not sharp and little fuzzy .there are minor issue with the app on android but the camera do the job as expected and I am going to keep it.I was not much interested in 360 videos but will test it later as well.I made some unwrapped  images to see how it works with manual setting via the app on android phone .The images looks better when viewed via the sphere pluginalso used mono-pod withEdit : Just made tests outside it is 10:00 PM  fantastic photos  the noise reduction under cam setting  is excellent improving the night shots so much. I am shooting all pictures with the noise reduction function it is like double quality make sure you change the image resolution to high under settings.
