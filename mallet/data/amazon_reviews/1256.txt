I usually wear an US size 22 Tall so I was really happy that this was offered in a 3X tall.  However when I got these I was slightly dissapointed.First I am 5'10 so I didn't expect the Talls to be so long on me!!!! The tall size was about 5" too long- even in heels (which I wouldn't wear working). But I liked the fit well enough so I returned them and got the average length.When I got the average length they were good on length but the fit felt entirely different. The crotch length was way too long and no amount of adjusting the tightness of the drawstring helps.Second the fabric is really stiff and not very flexible. I have a shirt that matches these pants and from experience I know it softens up a little with washing but these were way scratchier than the shirt that I have.Third these are a lot thinner than I expected. Thank goodness I got the black because if you buy them in a lighter color your undies may very well show through.These are an okay basic scrub pants but for the price I'd expect a better fit. The cheap $6 pair of scrub bottoms from walmart are much comfier and thicker than this.I'm returning them and buying a different pair.
