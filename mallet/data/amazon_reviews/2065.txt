I'm very happy with this purchase. I occasionally write magazine articles and wanted something that primarily worked as a word processor and has a good battery life. At first I was a little disconcerted that the only word processor was Google Docs until I figured out that this can be setup to work off line. There are other off line aps you can download but this works great since as soon as you connect to the internet it backs up the files on your google drive. I like the keyboard and the light weight of the device and the 13 hour battery life can't be beat. The wifi connection is fast even on cheesy airline connections and it is easy to use and to get to the apps you need the most is a breeze. Google really did the world a favor with the Chrome Book. Not all of us need a 2k dollar laptop that is loaded with software that you spend the first week deleting. I've owned many computers over the years from laptops that run Linux to a Mac tabletop. This one is hands down my favorite. If you want to know if this will work for you software wise all you have to do is try doing your work on Google Docs for awhile and if that is feasible this is your device. I'm not sure what all of the critisism is about. I understand it can be a pain to print from and I have not tried it yet but with Google Docs anything you put on it can be easily accessed and printed from another computer. I wish there was an Amazon Video app for it though there is an Amazon Music app. I havent tried to explore the ebook reader yet to see how that works but for what I wanted email word processing internet music etc it's perfect.
