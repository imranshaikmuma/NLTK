This camera worked great for us - no issues at all with the seals leaking.  I did my due diligence and read reviews and researched prior to purchasing this camera and I learned that ALL waterproof cameras should be rinsed thoroughly with fresh water and dried thoroughly prior to opening them to recharge battery etc.  With this in mind we followed those instructions after each underwater use and we had no issues at all with moisture inside the compartments.  In addition to the fresh water rinse and thorough drying we inspected each compartment cover for even the tiniest drop of water or grain of sand prior to opening.  A couple of times we did see a tiny drop of water or a grain of sand and we removed them and dried again (even waiting several hours for extra insurance) prior to opening.  This seemed to work as we used the camera daily for 7 days in the Virgin Islands and used it underwater on three different snorkeling excursions.  It took great underwater photos and we are very pleased with the camera.  Just be sure to follow all instructions and don't open compartments without a fresh water rinse and making sure absolutely no moisture around compartment openings or on seals.  Attached are just three of the several dozen under water photos we took.  By the way for accurate underwater color be sure to put camera on underwater setting.
