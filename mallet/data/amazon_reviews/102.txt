This is the lowest cost DSLR camera Canon makes their entry level DSLR.  It was released in 2014.  It has an optical viewfinder for pictures but not video.  The 3" LCD panel on the back affixed to the camera is used for video and can be used for pictures.  The optical viewfinder is blocked when the LCD panel is used because the mirror is lifted. This kit from Canon comes with both a18-55 mm and a 75-300 mm auto focus Canon lens plus a case.  These lenses provide the equivalent range of 29 mm to 480 mm with the APS-C image sensor providing a 0.6 wide angle to 9.6 telephoto range.  The 18x55 lens has image stability (IS) built in.  The camera can be used like a point and shoot camera or used in a totally manual/professional  mode with all settings controlled by the user.  The 18 Mpixel  APS image sensor provides very high quality pictures and full 1080 video.  I am very pleased with the camera kit.  I have only had this camera for two months but used a Canon AE1 film SLR for many years.
