After taking two photos with new batteries the camera would show the  batteries as being dead and would turn off.  Taking out the batteries and putting them back in you could take two more photos before it died again but the previous ones would be lost.  The product description said it could use a sd memory card.  No truth in that.  Called the consumer care center which was a disconnected number.  I went to the website of Polaroid.com and after being referred to two more numbers finally got a  person who said the product had been long ago discontinued by Polaroid.  I will be returning it.
