These are definitely not top-notch quality pants but that was made clear to me by the price. If I were looking for amazing quality I would expect to spend about twice this cost. For my needs these are perfect. I was most concerned with fit prior to purchase. I'm 5'10" and thin but curvy and often have trouble with the length of my pants. These are just long enough for me - even with the waist band folded down unlike other version I've purchased that aren't nearly long enough even when the waist band is pulled down onto my hips.
