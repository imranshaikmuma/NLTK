Very Disappointed for a brand new computer and the price paid. I'm starting to think this laptop came as used. This was a birthday gift for my husband. The first day was running well. Now it keeps updating each time is turning on and when finally it can be used it not connect to the WiFi. That is not an issue related with the modem. All the computers and devices in my house are connected without any issue. The cosmetic appearance is acceptable and the quality of the material is sturdy. But since is not working as it should I highly recommend to avoid purchase this computer. There are many better options available.
