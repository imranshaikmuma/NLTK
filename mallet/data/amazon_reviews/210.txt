This camera is amazing.The price is nuts but if you are looking at this camera then you already know what it's all about and are ready to shell out the big bucks.I jumped from my nearly decade-old 20D to this and obviously it's a whole new level.  If you have any investment at all in L series glass and/or fast primes you really need this camera body.  My photos were nice before but the full frame sensor working in concert with fast lenses (especially the fast primes) is simply awesome.The only and I mean the ONLY negative is lack of autofocus during movie recording.  Even that isn't all that bad if you prepare for it properly.I guess another negative is that this body is so amazing I want to spend even MORE money on glass.
