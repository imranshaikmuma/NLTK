These started to pill on the very first wash.  Contacted Amazon for a return.  they are comfortable but the pilling was unbelievable.  Even washed them carefully. I've had this pair now for several weeks. I can honestly say every time they're washed they pill. I use a hand razor to shave off the pilling which is a bit of a pain. What I will say is - they pill less if you wash them wrong side out. I disagree with some of the reports that they are uncomfortable. I find them to be very comfortable. In fact I plan to get more of them - I find the comfort is worth having to deal with the pilling.UPDATE:  I loved the comfort of wearing these so much I was determined to keep them. I did shave the pilling off I will tell you that after about four or five washes they pill much less. It usually occurs on the top thighs or on the tummy part and nowhere else.  Believe it or not they are so comfortable that I went ahead and ordered three more pair. I am also ordering some more today. The comfort is worth the effort of having to run a razor quickly over them and use a sticky roller. It only takes me about a minute or two to do it and then my pants are good to go for the day. I am  at work in the nursing home 5 to 7 days a week and I have never been too hot and my wonder when pants. As you know nursing homes are kept at a much higher temperature than most places. The colors are true and pretty the fit I find to be exact. I am 5 foot four and weighs 140  I find to be exact. I am 5 foot four and weighs 140-145 #. I have a curvy shape small waist large T heights and I am pear-shaped. I have longlegs and I ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. I increased the star level on my review just because I do love them.  Hope this helps.
