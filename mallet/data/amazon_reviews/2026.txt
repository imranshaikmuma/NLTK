Pros:Very light and no overheatingLong battery lifeBoots up instantlyMatte screen -maybe Im strange but I prefer thisDecent speakers-though some have complained they arent loud enough I find them decent enough for Youtube Hulu etc. I wasnt expectingthe quality of my old (rip) Toshiba satellite.Cons: Right now the only thing I can think no dvd drive which I use to use to do videos though I understand you can use an external. For the 200 dollar price of course that is to be expected.Keyboard ...the search key on the left hand side placement drives me crazy. Maybe its just me and I need to brush up on my typing but keep hitting it and the pop up box drives me Nuts! Normally there would be  Caps lock or something. I just hate it and wish the makers would put this on top of the keyboard because its an issue. Also can someone explain why there is a second Alt key on the right side instead of 'delete/DEL'?  Keyboard is a little cheap feeling and I hope this machine lasts me at least 3 years but otherwise happy with the quickstart up and locking feature (you will need your gmail password) to get in. DO NOT miss the constant Windows updates and fixes that constantly stalled my logging on...unless you need a Windows operating system for work.  This is a nice budget alternative for those of us who do not have the money for Macs.  ASUS just move the Search key somewhere else because for those of us who learned to touch type in school its an annoyance. Long battery life left it on a few hours and barely a dent in the battery icon. Very light plasticeasy to carry I was totally shocked and delighted how light it was. However I would purchase the care plan especially if you plan to take this on the road or travel. The only other added feature I would like to see in the future is backlit keys for those us with either old eyes or work in semi darkness.
