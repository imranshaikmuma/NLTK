La la llaaovveee this camera!! Just to start this review  I'm super ocd with my purchases. Definitely more lenient with purchases worth less I'll admit  but not for a piece worth almost 400$. I reaseched on different websites and even visited a few stores for the best deal. Long story short this was it after about a week or two or hunting the best deal . It does not get better than this folks. The camera came brand spanking new. It came with original accessories like neck strap battery cap for camera Lense cap and battery charger also a Manuel and cd for the camera oh and cords for the camera. Of course the camera also came with a brand new Lense too AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens. Yeah this Lense alone is worth 250. Also the standard Lense for the d3200 is the AF-S DX NIKKOR18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR not VR II.. So think this was a added bonus for buying the refurbished item and having faith in nikon. I'm transitioning from a SLR a FE2 to be exact. I love the functionality and all the capabilities of  this camera thus far. The resolution on the screen really helps make bold adjustments too. This is the perfect camera for the aspiring beginner photographer.  I'll post pics hopes this helps anyone trying to make a decision. Please like if it has thanks
