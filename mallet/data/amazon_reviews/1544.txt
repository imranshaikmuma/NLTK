I love these shoes but they do run a bit small.  I am a size 6 and I think a 6 1/2 would of fit better.  I have only encountered a few brands or styles that I am not a 6.  They hurt my right toe after a few hours of wear and I wear them with my thin socks.  As far as the shoe itself goes they are beautiful and I would recommend.
