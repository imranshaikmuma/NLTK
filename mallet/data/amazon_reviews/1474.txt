Awesome work pants my did come with that new car smell (I know very weird but it was definitely what it smelled like).So huge confusion on the size. I went to the local Wally world and i tried the three sizes available. Im not a fan of buying and returning so I took the guessing work out of it. Here is what worked for me at least. Relaxed/ loose fit order a size up. I am normally a 40 everywhere but 42 fit like a normal 40. The 874 or regular fit I had to go 2 sizes up. I could get a size up around my waist but way to tight on the hips and butt region. Lastly I tried the slim fit.... just didn't work at all for me. I wasn't made for slim/skinny. I also couldn't even find a 40/42/44 in stores. I tried a 38 on fully expecting they would be to small and they were about 4 inches from even clasping. So I assume maybe 2 sizes up also on them.The pants IMO should be washed before wearing. They are rigid. After a few washes they got alot more comfortable.
