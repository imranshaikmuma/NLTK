I am not going to talk your ear off. If you are looking at this camera then you probably have a good idea about it. At the moment it is the flagship camera of Canon's small sensor cameras. It is built like a tank weighs about the same but that heft gives you confidence in its build and function. I love it. I have done family portraits to Quincea√±eras and it always performs. Remember that lenses that are not specifically made for the crop sensor are going to have a telephoto effect not a huge issue but something to keep in mind. All of Canons ef lenses will work of course on this camera.The lens that comes with it is a good lens a great starter lens in fact. But you will want to upgrade. Quality glass is everything.The onboard flash works well but dont expect professional results and not beyond 15 feet. Invest in a good flash as well.I have no regrets in buying this camera and it really is a joy to use. This can be used as a basic point and shoot but why would you? It can do so much more. Learn the camera read the manual watch online tutorials then you will start shooting it like it was meant to.
