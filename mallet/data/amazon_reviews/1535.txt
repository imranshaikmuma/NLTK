I loved the GEL-Noosa tri 8's.  I had foot problems with the Tri 9's and had to get inserts because they caused fasciitis.  The 10's are back to perfect out of the box.  I wore them out of the box for more than 10 hours.  I am 73 and when there is any problem with a shoe I am crippled and in major pain.  I am delighted with the 10's!
