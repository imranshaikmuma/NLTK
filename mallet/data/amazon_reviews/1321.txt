I normally wear an 18/20 or 1XL in tops (210 lbs). My bra size is 40C. Tunic is very form fitting through the top and wold not accommodate anyone wearing over a C cup. The fabric is thin and somewhat clingy so order at least 2 sizes up. I ordered the 3X and it flows beautifully....absolutely love the style. The length is exactly what I was looking for ... fall mid-thigh and I'm 5'4" tall.
