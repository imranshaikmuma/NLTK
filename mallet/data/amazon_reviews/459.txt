Overall this is a very good pocket-size camera for the price.  The main thing that convinced me to buy it was the 12x zoom. One thing about it however really annoys me: It's impossible to turn off the digital zoom when shooting in fully automatic mode. Apparently it can only be turned off in program mode. Watching the zoom indicator while framing a shot is distracting but when zooming in the fully auto mode I have to; otherwise it will zip right past the 12x optical limit & into the digital zoom range up to 48x (!) without so much as a "by-your-leave." I HATE digital zoom! I'm undecided whether or not that's a deal-breaker. I may keep the camera & always shoot in program mode or I may return it. Camera makers know that digital zoom is a useless gimmick! Why do they do things like this to their customers?
