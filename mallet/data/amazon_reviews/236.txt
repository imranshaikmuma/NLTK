Awesome after week two seems much much better than my D5100 in low light and the touch screen is nice.  Picture quality is awesome.  Snapbridge works for me but seems to take a lot of power so I disabled downloading of photos to my phone.  I upgraded mostly to get GPS tagging from my phone which works great.
