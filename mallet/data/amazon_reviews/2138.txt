Good things!Awesome performance when playing video games such as Deus Ex Black Ops 3 etc on HIGH settings. I did change the hard drive to a SSD and put in some more memory which was icing on the cake really. The keyboard is also pretty amazing and feels great when typing. The speakers are much better than other laptop speakers sounds so good vs the minimalist speakers that other companies put in their laptops.Some things that could change in the next model!The material that they put on the inside of the laptop where the keyboard and mouse pad are is really horrible for keeping clean. It constantly obtains marks from your wrists laying there and from being touched in general. However I wouldn't not buy this because of that.
