The work to weekend pants from Haggar are my favorite work and casual dress pants that aren't blue jeans. They are comfortable and can be dressed up or down. The fabric is thick and good quality there is no sheen to the color which is great for business attire. If you live near a Haggar outlet check it out these pants usually sell for $29 there and you can save yourself some money. The Cool 18 pants are nice too if you are on a budget the fabric is thinner and great for summer time when you cannot wear shorts the fabric does have a sheen to it but it's not too bad I have a couple pairs I wear to work on those 100+ degree days here in the south. The Cool 18 pants can be had at the Haggar outlet for $19 which would save you a good amount of money compared to the work to weekend pants if you are on a tight budget.
