I am officially in love with my new camera. Had a Nikon D300 for years. There is simply no reason to buy up to the D810. The pictures are phenomenal. Higher fps than the 810. And I'm finding the tilt screen VERY useful. Just took photos of puppies. The tilt screen lets me get the camera down to face level. For taking food shots the tilt screen lets me raise the camera up over my head to get top down pictures of food. But what I really love is the increased ISO sensitivity! Light too low? Boost the ISO and you can use faster shutter speeds. The dual card slots let me shoot Raw in slot one and jpg in slot two. Why is this so wonderful? Because I also use my camera for everyday photos. With the Wifi capability I can send some jpg shots to Instagram or to a friend and then I still have my Raw photos for editing if I choose. I use 128Mb cards in each slot. I'm buying new lenses BUT I can still use some of my really good DX lenses with it - it automatically switches to DX mode when I put the older lens on.  As for the difference between 24mp pictures and D810's 36mp photos - 90% of photographers will NEVER need that much resolution. Honestly. Unless you're blowing up pictures to use as wall murals you'll never miss the higher resolution. And the lower fps speed on the 810 is much more of a loss.
