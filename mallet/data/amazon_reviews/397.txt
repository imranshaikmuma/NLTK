I bought a Cannon ELPH well over 10 years ago and used it all the time. In the last year I started having some problems with it and because I loved it so much I purchased this one. The first thing I noticed is the craftsmanship of this camera. While it is significantly lighter and thinner than my first camera it is not made as well. The battery door is made so flimsy when I go to open it I'm afraid it will break off. Also the latch to keep the battery in place is cheaply made. The settings are time consuming to find what you want or need. And if you are an amateur photographer like me and want to learn how to use the settings you have to download the over 300 page manual. This is not convenient to be out taking pictures and have to drag a computer with you to read the manual. Whatever happened to getting the manual with the product? I just received this camera this month so haven't really had a chance to play yet. I did take some pictures both inside and outside and so far not overly impressed. Maybe once I learn all the settings and how to get to them I will change my mind. So far the verdict is this will be the last ELPH I will be purchasing!
