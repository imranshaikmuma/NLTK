Something off about these shirts. Either knockoffs or quality inspection rejects. Came sealed in a "three pack" but contained 2L and 1M. 1 shirt has small red stains as if a red dye accidentally dripped on it. All shirts have strange red arrow stickers placed to point out flaws and irregularities in the shirts (red spots included). But they still function just fine as cheap white under shirts.
