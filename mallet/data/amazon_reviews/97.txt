Been shooting with this camera for about 12 days. It's a rugged work-horse like the D300 it's fast - and fast to focus (if it's not focusing fast - check your setting) and excellent in low light conditions but in bright light conditions images can be a bit washed out. Also shooting a D810 and I've read reviews that make the claim that the images are just as good as the D810 but I have to disagree here. Tested both cameras against each other shooting with the same settings lens & conditions and the D810 is the clear winner when it comes to image quality with that said the D500 is close behind. If you are used to looking at D810 images you will notice the difference in image quality between them. The D500 is a nice compliment to the D810 and it fits my need for shooting birds in low light conditions.  Images shot at ISO 4000 F5.6 speeds between 2500-8000.  Only cropped & brighten.  This is not a noiseless camera it still produces noise at high ISOs but much less then the majority of cameras out there and the details at high ISOs are extremely good.  Watch Tony Northrup's review & comparison of the D500 on YouTube to help put this in perspective.
