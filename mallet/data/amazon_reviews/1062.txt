I have other tops in this brand and absolutely love them so I wanted to absolutely love this one too. It is a toss-up between this and the cap sleeve hip length Bepei top. This top is a lighter-weight fabric & sleeveless which is great for our summers with temps up to 45Â°C or for layering with a light cardigan in springtime but it hits just below the waist so it doesn't give me the long lean profile I'm after. I have a short torso & where this top hits on me it makes me look thick in the waistline. It's definitely comfortable and looks better with a skirt than it does with capris or jeans. I also bought a Bepei top in the same style which I like better. It's a thicker fabric and has cap sleeves. Not as cool for summer but it hits a couple of inches lower and gives me a slimmer profile. This is a great top for hanging around the house but won't be worn as much as the Bepei top. I personally find this brand to run a little large & the tops are a loose flowy style. I'm 5' 7" size 10 32G chest and while I normally wear a medium in tops I ordered a small and it fits nicely. A medium would be too loose on me. All my other tops in this brand hit lower like the Bepei top so this is the only one in this brand I found that hits me at a less flattering point.
