Absolutely love my MacBook Pro. With all the touchbar support that's rolling out it has certainly turned into a useful tool. Battery life has not been an issue and the speakers are extremely loud. Everything is really snappy and the price isn't too outrageous when you consider this laptop(I use as a desktop at work with the awesome USB-C capabilities) will last 4-5 years no problem.
