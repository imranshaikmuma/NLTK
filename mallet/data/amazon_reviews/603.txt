This time lapse camera comes with a clear semi-weatherproof container batteries an SD card (4gb) bungee cords and fit my needs perfectly.  The photos are turned into video files that eventually have to be pieced together to make one long video to see the whole project.  Microsoft movie maker works just fine for this and allows you to save in different formats.  The container also has a few entry points where we found dust and moisture can penetrate but have never messed up the pictures.  I would have given 5 stars had it come with software a truly waterproof container and better instructions.  As is those are my only complaints.  The quality of video is excellent and the batteries have lasted quite a long time since we only take video for 5 sec per day.  It is an excellent alternative to the more expensive cameras that require hard-wiring and emit their own cellular signal.
