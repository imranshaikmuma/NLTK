I bought two Spot cameras and their features are amazing i.e. the motion and sound detection work well and the resolution is excellent on my cell phone.  Two problems though:1.  microSD cards are not always detected.  I have Sandisk 16G that are not detected.2.  A couple times a week I have to turn my cell phone off then on for the camera feeds to work.  This is a pain.I tried a couple of lower-cost surveillance cameras before these and they were total fails.  I don't think you will regret buying the Spot camera.
