I'm so not a sneaker kinda gal. I only bought these so I could have good shoes for jogging and the gym. I've heard by many people that asics was a good choice. I put these on and it felt like I stepped onto my memory foam mattress. So comfy and suuuuper cute! I think I'll be wearing them quite often.
