To start I am a what I call "extreme hobbyist."  I occasionally do professional shoots (i.e. graduation engagement shoots etc.).  I started with D60 and quickly moved to D3100 but was looking to make the leap to FX camera.  Had played with D7000/7100 and decided instead for the D750... and I am glad I did.  To be honest compared to my entry level DSLR (D60) this was a big change but this camera continues to have that Nikon feel.  Straight out of the box you know where the buttons and menus are.  It was easy to pick up.  The images I am producing are fantastic and have been very pleased with the prints.  Overall I would highly recommend this body to anyone looking to make the leap to FX camera or a professional looking for a solid back up.
