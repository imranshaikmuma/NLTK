I sweat a lot.If I'm on an elliptical there's sweat being flung in every direction like an a poorly thought out car-wash.While it only takes 10 minutes for me to work up a sweat that stretches from my chest to my belly this shirt wicks it up in no time at all. I thought the light grey would be a good test of this shirt's ability to wick given the lack of wiggle room the color usually affords. However I can walk to the sushi restaurant 4 minutes away from the gym and not look like a complete sweaty hog. My face will be wet but this shirt stays dry.This shirt won't make the cute girl at the gym look your way but your girlfriend won't completely disassociate you if you walk up to her wearing this after the gym.
