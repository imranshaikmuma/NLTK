The graphics on this laptop stink! Some news pages are sharp but the reason I bought this was to use for my business and when in the business site all the pictures look cartoon'ish and the white is hard to see.  I have fiddled witht eh settings to no avail. Colors are hard to distinguish and have caused me to make errors that if I were not double checking myself could cost me money in shipping the replacements.  Nice to have a portable devise not attached to a desk but def. not what I was expecting. Oh well cheap is as cheap gets.
