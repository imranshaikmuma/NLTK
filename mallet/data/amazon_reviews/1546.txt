the best thing about these sneakers is that they were cheap and that the color is gorgeous. The cushion was just 'meh' for me--no arch support at all. I loved the Flex RNs but they messed with the design and the newer versions suck. I am a nurse who works 4 twelve hour shifts a week--on my feet most of the day. I need a cushy sneaker with good arch support. Back to the drawing table I guess!
