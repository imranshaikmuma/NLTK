These are great shirts.  I really like that they are slightly heavier weight than most t-shirts.  That lets them stand up to multiple washings with bleach and it lets the shirt drape in a way that appeals to me for a winter t-shirt.  This is a fine well-made product in this size. I have ordered it twice.
