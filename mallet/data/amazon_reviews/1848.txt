I'd have to say this laptop certainly exceeded my expectations. I'll keep it short and simple with what i like and don't like about this chromebook (it is my first chromebook so bear with me):Like:- $300 pricetag for this machine is incredible- coming from a higher-powered machine i notice it is slightly slower but you really cannot ask for better performance from a chromebook right now- aluminum build quality is superb for $300 not better than a macbook but definitely comparable. keyyboard is nice albeit not backlit :/- chrome OS is simple and easy to use if youre familiar with the browser- 14 inch screen is clear and does the job well- battery life exquisite- light and portable feels solid in the handDislike:- no backlit keyboard- users coming from windows or mac may feel as though performance is slightly inadequateI could probably think of more things that I dislike about this machine but i havent had it for very long and i am unsure if the ram is upgradeable which would solve any slow issues in the future. other than that outstanding laptop for an outstanding price.
