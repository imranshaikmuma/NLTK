I work out on a regular basis doing cardio/ power lifting/ and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. High waisted leggings are important for all of these activities and these are perfect for that! I am 5' 4'' and 135 lbs with a curvy thigh and butt. I usually always wear medium bottoms (size 4-6). The previous reviews highly encouraged me to buy a small. I bought the small and they fit perfect. Not too tight not loose at all. Extremely comfortable thick/silky texture with a slight sheen. I would buy these again. I am glad I listened to the previous reviews regarding size! They feel like an expensive legging for an affordable price.
