Ok ladies lemme say this first: I have been anti-shapewear cinchers trainers etc for years.  I have always believed that if you don't look like that with your clothes off then why bother? I purchased this hoping that it may actually train my waist on top of making healthier choices of course.  But with a shape like mine I was pretty certain it would not fit.  What I mean by that is that I am extremely hippy and my lower stomach is pudgy.  Let me just say: I WAS SO WRONG!!! This fit and snatched ALL of my mid section up like magic.  I know some complain about the length...I am 5'3 and it PERFECTLY fits from beneath my boobs to right above my kit kat!  I broke a sweat putting it on the first time but it is super comfortable once you get it on.  I would recommend ordering a size larger if u can for that perfect fit.  I am able to sit and bend in it relatively easy!  It does not roll down or cut into my skin either.  I saw very few reviews representing the larger women so I knew I needed to post this.  The pics are all with the waist trainer on btw!  I wear a 22/24 in jeans and I got the 6x.  Idk if I'll wanna wear this all day but I will definitely sleep in it.  I hope I can see some results with this...so far so good though! Ladies please give this a try!!!
