Soft  comfortable and well-designed I want more! As for the fit I think many of the other reviewers who purchased larges and  Xl  might have liked the fit in a smaller size. They complain of a loose wide neckline and big bat wing sleeves but those are not issues if the top is sized correctly. This top is super stretchy and with the ruching there are infinite adjustments in the mid section to fit over a multitude of body types. I am 5'3" and weigh 150lbs. A large or extra large would be baggy and sloppy on me. The fabric is thin without being sheer. Note: after wearing it twice in two weeks and  washing on gentle (lay flat to air dry) I am noticing the material is starting to pill/show wear (blue top)  . It's looking like a comfy pajama top now. I can only imagine how it would look if I had tried to tumble dry in the dryer. That did not stop me from purchasing more... just please know the shirt may not last long if washed and dried in a washing machine.Lesson learned read and follow the label directions. Update: The pink and grey tops in photos  have been machine washed on hand wash/gentle cycle and layed flat to dry  they are holding shape and are not pilling  like the light blue shirt.
