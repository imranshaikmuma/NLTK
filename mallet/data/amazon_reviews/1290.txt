I live in the Pacific Northwest and our winters are very wet and very cold! I decided to splurge and finally buy myself some nice snow boots. These boots are true to size so I bought a size 7.5 (I am either 7.5 or 8 in women's shoes depending on the brand) and they fit me perfectly even with my wide feet and with thick fluffy socks on. I like that these are adjustable and fit my enormous calves just fine - plus you only need to adjust the laces once. After that you just use the zipper to take them on and off.I bought the grey boots and I absolutely love them! Note that the product photo colors are not accurate - they actually look WAY better in person. The grey material is darker and the yellow leather is actually a tan (I saw other customer photos before purchasing so I knew what to expect). I've worn these out in the rain and the snow multiple times and my feet were dry and warm the entire time. They are also very comfortable and this is coming from someone who spends the rest of the year in memory-foam slip-on flats.I have gotten so many compliments on these boots. They really are gorgeous. They look great with fleece-lined leggings!
