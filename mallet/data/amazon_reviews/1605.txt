Update!  As I hoped these softened some with washing without losing any of their toughness. Will definitely be buying more!I needed tough work pants and could only find lighter-weight ones offered 'for ladies'. Hubby bought these in his size and loves them so I decided to risk ordering them for myself. I am 5'2" 25" waist 35" hips 107 lbs. I got the smallest ones offered (28x30)and they fit fine!! A bit stiff the first wearing - I did not wash before wearing as we are in the middle of a building project and I wanted to test them right away.  They fit comfortably at my real waistline (not low riding or hip huggers).  I can move freely (climbing ladders etc.) and they don't pull up or fall down with or without a belt.  The fabric is very tough and putting kneepads in them made kneeling on concrete surprisingly comfortable.  The only very minor negative I can mention is the lack of cargo pockets on the front for my gloves - and only because I'm accustomed to BDUs with loads of pockets!  Ladies this was a very pleasant surprise so if you're looking for work pants that are tough and can stand up to cactus yucca mud dirt etc. etc. try these out.
