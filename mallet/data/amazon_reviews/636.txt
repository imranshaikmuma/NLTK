This is a fantastic little camera! I've owned several point-and-shoot cameras over the years including Canon Nikon and Kodak brands and this one is the best so far.  I've owned this camera for 3 weeks now and have taken it on one vacation and many excursions.  It's ready to go straight out of the box (battery comes pre-charged) and is very easy to use.  I could easily navigate the controls based on past camera experience.  I have yet to need the manual for anything but at some point I will have to use it to figure out the transfer to smartphone feature because it is not intuitive.  The buttons are very small which is good for people with small hands but if you have larger fingers or hands they may not be easy to navigate.  I took approximately 200 pictures on the first day and still had 1 bar left on the battery meter.  It was fully charged again in an hour and a half.  The tiny size of the camera is one of it's best features.  It fits easily into the pockets of my "skinny jeans" (you know the ones with the tiny half-pockets in the front).  And the Sony DSCWX220 weighs just a few ounces so you may even forget it's in your pocket.  The pictures are sharp and have vibrant colors.  The auto-focus works quite well and you are able to get the small details in each shot.  The shutter speed is incredibly quick compared to other cameras and smartphones so you don't miss capturing those once in a lifetime moments.  The quality of the pictures taken are much better than my Samsung S5 or my husbands Samsung 6.  It takes very good pictures in low light.  I'm not saying these are high-end professional quality pictures but it's a huge step up from smartphone quality.  For well under $200 it's a steal for budget conscious casual shooters.
