This camera is fantastic and it has everything a beginner would want and more.So far I am very satisfied with this camera and it takes fantastic photos. I say this would be a good camera for a beginner because it is sort of an entry level camera. I feel like some people seem to think that entry level camera aren't very good that does not apply to this camera at all. It has all the buttons and knobs a person could want and all in a pretty small package.This camera is pretty small compared to bigger cameras like the t5i or the 70d. It is somewhat the size of a bigger mirrorless camera which for me is fine because I don't need a big camera to do big task. The only little annoyance is that the grip is pretty small but it is duable.Overall I definitely think this camera is worth your money and should be a camera to consider buying.IMAGES TAKEN WITH a Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM Lens.
