I live in Texas. I work outside. Right now it's cold and it's only going to get colder. So I had to get a jacket for the season.I had been looking for a jacket everywhere. I finally stumbled upon the Carhartt brand and after much review I found my new favorite jacket!This jacket is comfortable and durable. I wear it to work everyday and I haven't been cold once. Not even in 20 degree weather.If you're thinking twice about purchasing this jacket DON'T! It's worth it. I'm glad I dished out the $ for such a quality product.For reference I am 6'2" 200 lbs lean. I was thinking about getting a medium but I was worried about the chart size fitting me and the flexibility. You DON'T want to own a jacket that's too tight! So I got a Large I THINK I may have gotten away with a medium they do seem to run a bit large. BUT I'm perfectly happy with mine. I'm not trying to impress anyone just trying to stay warm in the cold!
