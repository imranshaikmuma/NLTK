I fell in Love with this piece online!! . I ordered 1 for each of my 2 sisters 65th Birthdays in which they both thought it was Beautiful as well. I also purchased 1 for my 28 yr old daughters Birthday who in turn has ordered me 1 as well.On that note 1 of my sisters then turned around and ordered 2 more for her daughters who are in their 30's for Christmas gifts. So far with the family trend I have started we are at (6 and counting).On that note I wanted to know if you have Earrings to match...  .Once again Thank You for this beautiful timelessageless piece of Art and Love It truly has become a family heirloom and collector piece Sincerely Wendy
