This was a great laptop.  When I first received the laptop I would have given it five stars.  With the SSD the machine is fast and very capable of multitasking.  The Zenbook has a good number of ports and is aesthetically pleasing.I was working some spreadsheets then the laptop fan sounded like it was ready for lift off.  Shortly thereafter I had the unfortunately smell of burning electronics.  Then it was over.  The machine was dead and I was unable to retrieve any of my data or programs.  I had owned the machine for about a month at this point using it daily.When I contacted Amazon support the agent took less than 30 seconds to authorize a return with refund.  I have since replaced the laptop with a different model Asus and have been quite happy with it.
