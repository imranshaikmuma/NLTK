Ordered twice.  The first order was very comfortable.  So I ordered more!  The second order was completely different with far inferior material.  I mentioned this to the seller and they stated they would refund the order if I returned it.  But this doesn't fix the problem -- I ordered something didn't receive it now must do more work to ship it back to then search for the actual product and hope it works the second time.  Thus I told them it wasn't worth my effort.  They then offered 15% off.  But I didn't bother accepting this ... what I actually want -- is the product I ordered.  I don't want money.  I want comfortable socks.  I would love to order these again but have no confidence that the proper product will be shipped.  I thought through direct conversation the issue could be found and fixed after all people make mistakes and they are fixed all the time.  But they focused on trying to make me happy with money rather than making me happy with the correct product.  At least they tried though which was appreciated.
