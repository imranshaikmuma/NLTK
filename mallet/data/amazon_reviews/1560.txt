If you're concerned about fit and comfort more than price these are NOT the scrubs to buy.  The top fits slightly large around the bust and under the arms and snug around the abdomen and waist.  I tried two sizes the XL and the 2XL- the 2XL was way too big throughout the entire top and the XL provides too snug a fit for my comfort.  I want scrubs that provide a professional looking fit not baggy and sloppy.  While lightweight the material does not seem to breathe so if you're working in a warm building and doing  a lot of walking etc. you get hot fast.  I've washed the top 4 or 5 times and the material is still somewhat stiff.  Overall not a great product.
