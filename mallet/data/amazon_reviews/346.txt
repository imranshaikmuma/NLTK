I bought this camera for my 81 year old Mom for Christmas. I was so disappointed when I found it in a small generic box. This is a gift and it appears to be used/refurbished. I tried to set it up ahead of time because she has a difficult time figuring technology out. I couldn't load directly from the camera. I finally could load from the memory card and pictures look good. Time will tell unfortunately she will be opening a "new gift" that will be perceived as a cheap used camera.
