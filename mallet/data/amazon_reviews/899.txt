Over the years I've tried maybe 6 Blu phones. All of them looked amazing but we laggy to the point it drove me nuts and if take them back. I just got the Vivo XL2 and I'm absolutely happy with this phone. It's freaking stylish as usual but it has tons of bells and whistles like a more expensive phone and so far it works amazingly  well. I can't believe how nice this phone is for the price. Unreal. And ignore the 64 gig SD card limitation. It took my 128 gig no problem at all. LOVE MY NEW PHONE!!!  If Blu keeps this up I'll keep buying Blu.
