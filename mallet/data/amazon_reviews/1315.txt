If I could give this product a hundred stars I would. It is my first waist trainer and why had I not bought this sooner??!! It's amazing and is wearable I can wear it to work ( in an office) & no one even notices it I did get a lot of compliments on how I looked slimmer which I loved! The sizing is the size you'd normally wear I wouldn't go based off the size the chart gives you though because according to the chart I was a 3xl but the xl is barely tight I will be ordering an L soon as I want it tighter. But if you're heaitating don't. You will love it!!It comes with a smell like plastic buy once you see the results you'll forget all about it. It definitely enhances your curves.
