This phone is $20.  I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that.  Let's be real this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is.  If you want it for that purpose it does every thing you need.  If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone you're going to want to go with something with a little more features.  This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag.  That's exactly what this phone is for.  The controls are not slick the construction sucks and is cheap and the sim card is hard to remove but honestly if I ever had to use this and the time on that card chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one. Here's to telling it like it is and not complaining about an imperfect phone that doesn't live up to an iPhone for twenty bucks.
