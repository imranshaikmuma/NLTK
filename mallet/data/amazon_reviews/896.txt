such a beautiful phone and works perfectly well. It will take some time to figure out what all it has and how to make it all works but as far as having a nice phone this is it. I bought one for me and one for my wife. The cameras are so amazing very beautiful pics both front and rear and really nice selfie in not so great light. Nice phone. I'll comment later on as time goes by. My daughter got the Vivo XL LTE for christmas and we haven't had any trouble yet works like a charm and my daughter works everything on it. Wonderful.
