I've been trying to find replacement shirts to wear under my scrubs. This shirt fits very well without adding to much bulk.  It is a bit sheer but again with wearing under scrubs I'm not really too concerned about that.  I stay warm enough in my office (which sets the ambient office temperature somewhere near arctic tundra) without needing to add my lab coat. As I've only had it for about a week I'll update once there has been more consistent wear and tear and multiple cleanings.  So far I'd recommend it to anyone needing an additional layer without wanting to feel too bulky.
