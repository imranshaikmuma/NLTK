So far it is great. Almost no bloatware on this product. 1 tb ssd is great and if you are buying this for a budget laptop you really dont need more than 1tb. It has many neat features and is really a great laptop for low budgets. The only con so far is the touchpad is a bit large and does not have indicators of where the left and right click button starts and ends but thats not a problem just use a mouse. I highly recommend this product. I was not asked to write a review but i felt the need to because i remember looking around for a laptop and wanted help knowing which is good.
