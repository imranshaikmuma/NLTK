These were lighter-weight than I expected but I really like them. After reading all the reviews saying they ran huge I ordered mine a size down from what I might have. They fit ok and loosen up after a little wear but are a little snug at first in some places when I bend. lol  Not sure if I'd order a size up next time or not having worn them that long yet. I didn't know they were considered "scrubs" when I was looking at them at first. I was just looking for some basic light-weight casual flares that weren't yoga pants or roll-over waisted or sweats. These are pretty much what I was looking for. I got petite -I am a little over 5'- and they were a couple inches too long but that's nothing new for me. I was pleased there were so many size options and also that the pants have pockets. Happy I found these.
