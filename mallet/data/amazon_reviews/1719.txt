Bought several of these scrubs all the same size but different colors.  The black scrubs fit like they should.  All the rest fit small.  Very disappointing.  Got all of the scrubs in one shipment and pulled out the black ones and tried them on which fit great.  Took tags off of all of them and put in washer.  Went to work monday and put on the teal ones and couldn't believe the fit difference.  I think Amazon should replace all the scrubs but the black ones...sizing is defineatly wrong or mismarked.
