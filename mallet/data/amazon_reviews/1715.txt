I really like the cut on this top it is form-fitting without being tight or restrictive and the pockets are okay not quite deep enough though. I had trouble keeping bandage scissors pulse ox. and so forth in my pocket. But since I work in an acute adult psychiatric hospital it wasn't a huge problem. The top came to mid-hip on me I am 5'9" and long-waisted however the top didn't ride up and stayed in place throughout my shift.
