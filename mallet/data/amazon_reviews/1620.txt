I purchased this product to waterproof a pair of suede boots that I had treated last winter. Unfortunately the product that I used the first time around wasn't an aerosol. It was one of those waterproof products that come in a plastic bottle with a manual push button design. Since I have arthritis in my hands I found that the push button design was almost impossible for me to use as my thumb would go numb after just a few pushes. Thankfully I found this item for sale on Amazon.As the directions state I treated each boot than let them sit for 4 hours. Than I repeated the process. Aside from the 4 hour interval the entire treatment for a pair of boots took less than 5 minutes. It left me with no pain and did a fabulous waterproofing job. Now I'm all set for whatever winter brings on.The bottom line is that this product performs as advertised and is easy to apply. It's also gentle on your thumb if you have arthritis. I would estimate that there's enough liquid in the bottle to double treat at least 6 pairs of heavy winter boots. This is definitely a great product for the money.
