The pants are almost too short but doable however the real problem was getting to work and discovering that the seem on my thigh started to open up which was pointed out by a patient. First time wearing them and there's already a hole????I'm not impressed I had ordered two additional colors but I think I will just return them when they arrive.  It's a shame because they are really cute.
