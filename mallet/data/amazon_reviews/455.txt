Indoor shooting is horrid but that was expected and not the intended use for the camera. Composite shooting with non-moving subjects works great inside but don't plan on using that on people. Seems well built but I can hear a slight rattling from within the camera's body. Not concerned about that but this thing is supposed to survive a 6-foot drop. Powers on VERY quickly has integrated GPS and the wi-fi functionality is dead simple. If Olympus would just upgrade the optics this would be an amazing camera. As-is it's a very portable weatherproof camera that will take acceptable pictures in sunlight. Attached is a sample 10-second composite shot shot in my bathroom and another picture taken in natural light.
