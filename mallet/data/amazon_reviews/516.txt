What an amazing camera! I borrowed the DSC RX10 1 from a friend for two international trips before purchasing the DSCC-RX10 3. The camera is lightweight perfect for low light settings and the zoom is great. I'm not sure what I will do with my expensive Canon camera and interchangeable lens but the new Sony is my new go to camera.I did buy the book by Alexander White on how to use the many features of the camera and even thought I am skilled photographer the book just helps you better use this camera.
