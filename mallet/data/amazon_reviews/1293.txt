Boots fit as I expected them to; I can wear a thick pair of socks with them. The zipper is nice for putting on quickly. The ties in the front I thought were just decorative but are great for widening the portion on your lower leg. This is helpful if needing more room to tuck jeans into for thick socks or if you have larger calves.The foot portion is a little stiff I've had them three days and am trying to loosen them up. They are warm for sure.Update: they have loosened up. Good fit. They have been warm as dry when walking through snow and shoveling.
