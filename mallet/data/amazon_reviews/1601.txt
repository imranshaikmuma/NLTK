i have a husky. a white husky. and wearing black is shall we say difficult! i can just walk through my house and be covered with white hair.i went through industrial sized rolls of lint tape. i did research on uniforms that repel pet hair and i came to these scrubs. they were priced right so i thought i would take a chance. today i put them on and when i arrived to work not a hair! when i got home i swept vacuumed AND stripped my bed. normally that would leave me looking like a yeti. still NOT. A. HAIR! i will be buying more for sure!
