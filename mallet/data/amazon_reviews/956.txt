Buy if:You dont text muchWould like simple talk and textDont emailDont need internetDont buy if:You dont use bluetoothYou want an advanced interfaceWant to use wired headphonesIts light cheap and easy to read. Once you calibrate touch screen even texting isnt hard just a bit slow. THIS IS BASICALLY A 2G PHONE ON A WRISTBAND. If you realize that this is a great item.
