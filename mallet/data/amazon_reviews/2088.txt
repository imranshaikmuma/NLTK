After a week or so of ownership the laptop is fantastic! The laptop is sturdy yet not too heavy. The shift key being in an odd place took one day to get used to (not a problem). It's fast and works perfectly.Reason for 4 stars: The laptop fan is fairly noisy by default. I used a fan controlling software that adjusted the fan speeds to an appropriate level and now the laptop is silent! Since I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post links here search for the software: Notebook FanControl it comes with a preloaded config file for the Lenovo Yoga 710 (this is not as technical as it sounds Google around for help).
