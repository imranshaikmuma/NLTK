After reading all reviews i bought this with the mentality that it will be my son toy camera if it fails to work but i am really very happy and suprised at how good the camera is at the price point. Of course the photo quality and colour cant be compared to those expensive underwater cameras but It held up well for my maldives snorkelling for 2 full days (2-3 snorkelling session which are at least 1 hour long) with lithium battery. Good investment for recreational users. I'll let the pictures speak for the camera.
