This is one great laptop. If your looking for a full HD screen 8gbs or ram a backlight keyboard and a i5 processer this is your laptop. I've been very impressed with it so far. The only complaint I have is the battery doesn't last as long as I would like it too. It's about 5 hours. Other then that this laptop is great. I would recommend.
