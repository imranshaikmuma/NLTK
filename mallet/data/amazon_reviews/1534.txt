The quality on these was not bad. It is what I anticipated to get for $15.00 for a set of scrubs. Based on other reviews I ordered one size down from my normal size so I was not swimming in them. I think they really miss the mark on "plus sizing". They fit me but they were uncomfortably tight especially around my thighs. I would tell a plus size person to order the size they normally wear I was unable to even pull my pants up all the way.
