Wow!! Wow!! How do I begin to list the impressive attributes of this phone? Let me try. It is slick fast sophisticated ergonomically designed has unrivalled battery life reasonably priced (in comparison to others with similar performance specs) sturdy and contemporary really a work of art.  Ok I think you get the picture now. And yes the picture - both the quality and mechanism are first rate and quite easy to use. There is no need to spend more money on the so-called "high end" phones unless you are into sophomoric bragging rights.
