They fit perfectly and stay up without a belt if you buy 'em in your size. I've owned several pairs of shorts from Dickies over the years along with their workpants and shirts and my only problem with these shorts is that the seams burst rather easily and unexpectedly at times leaving you with a very visible white streak that draws attention to your now damaged article of clothing.Other than that these pants are awesome. They are also available in a wide variety of colours too. Can't go wrong with that.
