I am extremely impressed with this phone! It came packaged great with a case screen protector earphones and charging cable with a plug. It really a beautifully designed phone its pleasing to the eye. It took a bit to get use to the power button on the side but now i actually prefer it there. It runs just as well as an expensive phone no lag no issues. It does only have 8gb of memory and the system takes up 4gb so keep that in mind but with my sd card i haven't had any memory issues. If you are looking for an affordable phone that works like an expensive phone this is it. This phone runs just as well as my lg g4 did and for a hell of a lot less money!
