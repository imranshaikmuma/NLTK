The charge port was broken. It can only charge intermittently. I tried different cables but the problem was not solved so it must be due to the product. I thought it was reliable product because it is an Amazon certificate refurbished and the product must have passed their examinations. However it came with an obvious defect which suggests that the product has not been tested or the test is not reliable. I really need a replacement as soon as possible. I would be grateful if you could respond.
