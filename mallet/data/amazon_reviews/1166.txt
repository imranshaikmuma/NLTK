I ordered 2 sizes up based on other people's reviews so I got a large instead of my usual small. I'm 5'3" and 125 lb for some additional background information.I was hoping that I'd be able to wear this as a tunic with some leggings underneath but because of my bigger hips and smaller waist it ended up looking like I was wearing a weird and boxy potato sack. It hugs my hips and totally erases my waistline when worn that way (see 1st picture).However this is SO CUTE as a slouchy shirt like I'm wearing in my other 2 photos so it ended up not being a disappointment at all. The material is soft and lightweight too!Some discrepancies to note: the patterns are the same on each arm (not offset like in the picture) and the gray color of the shirt is significantly lighter than in the picture. These differences don't matter to me personally though.In the end I really should have known better that this wouldn't work out as a tunic with my body type but if you're stubborn like me then there's no harm in giving this a shot as a shirt!
