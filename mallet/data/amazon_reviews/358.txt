I highly recommend this camera--I took it on a 2-month round-the-world trip this past summer through all sorts of punishing weather conditions and not only did it hold up without a single problem but it took some of the best photos I've taken in my life.Besides the very manageable size my favorite part of the camera is the zoom--on safari in Africa I was able to clearly capture animals that those with much more bulky and expensive cameras were not able to capture so well. My one gripe and I was expecting this with a small-lensed camera is that it struggles in night-time conditions although it did well at dusk and dawn.Please see my photos for examples of what this camera can do.
