The shirt is what I was Looking for and the Color was right on and I think that they are made some what pretty good like they would wear and hold up. BUT when you put a size chart up on your ad I WOULD think that  YOU as a SELLER  would put the right sizes in there. I order what I thought to be a XL size and even the 2 shirts I ordered are marked as XL's But there is NO!!!! way in hell that they are that size. I have given them to a friend that wears a Med. size shirt and if you hold them up side by side that is what they are a Med. NOT a XL as they are marked.. So I would like to have shirts that I could wear But I am very scared to reorder 2 more Not knowing if I will get some that will fit me or not and there is no way to get a hold of the seller to talk to them about the problem so I am just out $40.00. SUCKS!!!!
