It is a bona fide Dick Tracy phone. Buy if:- you are so used to wearing a wrist watch you would not leave home without it;- you don't have a data plan;- you plan on using a blue tooth ear piece or head set;- you only need three functions: show the time receive phone calls and text messages;- you will return your watch phone to the charger every night.Do not buy if you need a smartwatch to send notifications from your smartphone. The Android app sucks! I only use it to set the time. Also beware that texting on the tiny touch screen should be reserved for emergencies.The watch has a built in speaker and microphone. In a pinch you make a call from it. With a blue tooth headset it makes for a very usable compact 2G phone. It also has a functional audio player and a slot for micro SD card. You need the card in order to use the built in camera and the audio player. Based on my experience I should not have bothered with the memory card because:- Low image quality makes the camera useless and- Playing music on blue tooth depletes the battery in a few hours.I needed a replacement for my flip phone and the Dick Tracy phone does a good job. Other features like camera music player and connectivity are not working as well as I'd like them to. Hence the four star rating. Despite the limitations it is a good value if you know what you are getting.
