Fit  is  just as it says.  Color  matches  picture  – I purchased the hunter green for my husband and  it looks  great!  He is very sensitive  when it comes to  his clothes  "scratching" him  but has no  problem  wearing this one. He did say that it's a touch stiff even after  2 washes  but I think that's  the  wrinkle  guard they put in it.  I bought it for him because he hates  typical dress shirts but needed  something reasonably nice to wear  in the winter.  I didn't even know  he had washed it twice because it looked  straight out of  the package – perfect  for a man who  doesn't iron  and doesn't usually remove shirts  immediately  from the dryer!  Thinking of getting him  more colors.
