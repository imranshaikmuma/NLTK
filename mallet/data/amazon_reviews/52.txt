This camera is an amazing high quality video camera with amazing pictures as well. I got this for my son and his youtube channel and he loves it. He's taken an interest into taking photos because of the easy to use and quick set up. The touchscreen really comes in handy and for under $1000 this bundle really does its job. Below are some pictures he has taken with the 18-55mm kit lens. If willing to invest the 50mm lens f 1.8 stm is a really great lens for the price.
