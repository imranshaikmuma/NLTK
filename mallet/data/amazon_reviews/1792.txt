Finally a scrub jacket that doesn't fit like a burlap sack!  I am 5'5" and ~ 120# and I bought X-Small. The fit is flattering thanks to the stretch in the fabric and some princess seams in the back; the sleeves are long but not too billowing and the length hits me at low hips.  Happy to have this addition to my scrub wardrobe.  Love the Cherokee Core Stretch line of scrubs - very soft comfortable and good quality. Great price too.
