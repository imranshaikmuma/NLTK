Like most people here this is my first DSLR. But unlike most people I am starting to get semi-pro usage out of it only after a year of owning it. And it doesn't disappoint. When paired with better glass the camera really does shine. The light weight body comes in handy when trekking up a mountain or shooting an all day festival and the deep grip is reassuring as you make your way around the world. I can't attest for the auto setting because I am forcing myself to learn by always staying in manual. Kind of a "baptism by fire" approach. Didn't take tack long to get the feel of where all the buttons are located and I really appreciate that it has a programmable back focus button. The touch screen is responsive and the tilt comes in handy when either shooting low down and especially when on a monopod shooting high up.  Autofocus is decent and doesn't hunt too much. Photos are usually tack sharp even at 1:1. I'm impressed with how clear photos are when pushing the iso way up for concerts and the DX sensor with 24.2 megapixels allows you to crop way down and still keep crisp shots for wildlife and the like.  All and all I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who is interested in moving up from a point and shoot without breaking the bank. Provided some shots but here is a Flickr link of more shots all from the d5500.[...]
