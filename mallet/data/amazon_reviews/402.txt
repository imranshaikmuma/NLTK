This camera was for my daughter. She likes to take pictures and make videos but I am not ready to spend a large amount of money on a better camera for her. This one has blurry and grainy pictures and does not hod many pictures but it suits it's purpose. It would not work for me taking pictures of the family to keep but it is adequate for her. It makes her happy and I didn't spend hundreds of dollars on something she will break or loose interest in.
