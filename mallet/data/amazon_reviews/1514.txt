Lee item number is 3051893 98% cotton 2% spandex in "authentic azul."In comparison to the relaxed fit straight leg Lee's of ten years ago (for example):For years I lived in Lee's relaxed fit jeans.  I am short and wide and I liked the way that the jeans were cut curvy.  However when the Lee jeans found in stores dropped in cotton content I stopped buying them.These jeans with 98% cotton had my hopes up.  However this fabric is definitely stretchier and does not offer support for those of us who don't want to show every jiggle.  I am not looking for a control panel but I don't want to feel like I'm baring everything in lycra tights either.The cut is not the same either.  These feel as if they are cut straighter (more of a man's fit?).  The jeans are a bit tighter in the upper thigh and do not curve inwards as much at the waist.  Also the waist is higher... I purchased a "short" size and still might need to fold the waist band over.  I would have tried exchanging for a size lower if there had been more room in the thigh of this pair.So why two stars rather than one?  I do approve of the higher cotton content and hope Lee jeans goes back up to 99% or even 100%.  Also while the pants do not fit well the fit is a tad better than the lower cotton content Lee's that I tried at the local stores.
