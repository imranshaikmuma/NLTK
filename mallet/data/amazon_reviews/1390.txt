WOW & WOW & WOW!!!Ready to jump and cheer!!  Finally a shoe that fits and feels wonderful!I have a wide foot (metatarsals ache in regular shoes).  I used the Sizing Chart and what others said to order (I ordered a 7.5 E since I measure 9.5 inches long and have a Wide metatarsal).  Happy to report they fit PERFECT!!!!  And there is no tightness on the metatarsals!  There was no time to "break them in" as they felt perfect right out of the box.I have walked all day in them and quite frankly...I forgot I was wearing shoes! The inner sole is very comfortable.  Super comfy can walk all day in them super lightweight and they give support.  I think these are amazing shoes and recommend them to anyone who enjoys a comfortable shoe.UPDATE:  I have had this pair for about 6 months wearing them basically every day.  I finally put them to the doorway to be used as quick slip ons as the insole is not as comfortable for all day wear.  Gladly I did purchase 2 pair so I have my backup pair as the main shoe!
