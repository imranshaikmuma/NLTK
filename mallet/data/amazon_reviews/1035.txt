I got this in a XXL in a few colors. The material of these tops are light and airy. They are comfortable tops perfect for summer or hot climates (I have summer year round). I'm 5ft 11" and wear 42DD and find this top adequately roomy in the bust area. It also falls great at the waist with enough material to sit above the hips or below if that's what you prefer. I do wish that I had bought a few of my tops in a XXXL so that it would have fall off the shoulders a bit. I found the sizing in all 13 of the tops that I bought to be the same. Whether I wear these casual with jeans or dressy casual this is a great top.
