This is my first time purchasing a "real" camera. I have been very pleased so far and I am learning something new each time I use it. There are some very helpful guides and communities online to give you a crash course in shooting in manual. It takes great pictures in the auto setting. But I seem to get much more enjoyment out of taking pictures in manual and playing with the settings!
