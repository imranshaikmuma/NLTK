Opening the box I found a perfect telephone for my problematic partial blindness and elderly fumble-fingers. Large keys and bright easy-to-read keypad - even a radio! BUT there was no getting the phone to either send or receive calls. Immediately after receiving the phone I had a techy friend insert the SIM card but there was no result. The useless trinket went back into its box --- until last Saturday January 28 2017 when I calledConsumer Cellular my service provider to ask if they would try to make my new cell phone operational if I sent it to them. Instead they referred me to their service technicians at Target and made a 3PM appointment for me. For two solid uninterrupted hours (3-5PM) two incredibly patient and conscientious technicians tried every fix they could come up with to get the phone working. Of course I had been paying monthly service fees long before the new unusable phone ever came and have continued to pay for unusable service ever since its arrival. Reluctantly the two gentlemen pronounced the new-and-never-used BLU Tank II T 193 not usable and suggested I ask Amazon to replace it with a workable unit. On checking the Amazon returns information I learn that opportunity to return the faulty phone expired in November so I'm without a cell phone as I prepare for an out-of-town trip and need one badly for emergency contacts.  Amazon and ole BLU both of you done me wrong - and for no reason. Am I blue? You'd be too. Ain't these tears in these (one of them blind) eyes tellin' you?
