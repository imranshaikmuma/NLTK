I love this laptop because it's powerful and capable of running most of mid-high end games on medium settings.I love the speakers they have a terrific capabilities and they sound great loud and clear.The only thing that i didn't like which is if you play a game on high setting the body of the laptop gets really hot that makes ot impossible to put in the lap.
