This laptop is a great combo of premium features with substantial power for general use. It initially felt a little slow but it got much faster after applying a bunch of Windows 10 "feature updates' and allowing it to 'burn in' for a few days. Here's the gist folks:Pros:-Sharp & bright 1080 display looks even better if you tweak the colors in the Intel Graphics Setting.-Wonderful backlit keyboard.-The battery life is PHENOMENAL! Now it's not *quite* 12 hours but I've used it up to 7 hours off and on with reliable performance so far. In my experience that qualifies as phenomenal.-DDR4 RAM and newest Core i3 CPU make it perfect for normal browsing streaming videos or general office work. I recommend buying this for the empty RAM slot to get the most out of it: Ballistix Sport LT 4GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - BLS4G4S240FSD-Sleek design resist smudging much better than that glossy stuff many laptops have.-USB 3.0 and USB 3.1 C connections future proof your interface options.-The price $350 is a steal!Cons:-Screen bezel feels a little flimsy especially since the hinges resist a little so be gentle or say screw it and buy the warranty.-Webcam is grainy in low/spotty lighting. If you care about such things it's not ideal.-Battery is not removable which will be a concern down the road. I assume I can take the laptop apart and replace it but I'll let Future Me deal with that mess.-No HDD activity light. Maybe I'm just old but I miss having it for some dumb reason I can't explain.-Lacks premium features like an SSD dedicated GPU the latest Core i7 CPU and can't run Battlefield One on max settings. Oh wait I knew that because I'm not 'tarded and deliberately purchased this product knowing it had none of those things. Weird that I would complain about all that in a review. /s
