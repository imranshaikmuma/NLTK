i just got my first pair of danskos today and i couldnt be happier! i've been on a quest to find the perfect work shoe that has a little height to it and with this purchase i'm pretty sure it has officially come to an end. they are terrifically comfy and i cant wait to try them out.as far as the sizing i'll share my situation just in case it might help anyone else out...i have very very odd feet. they're a bit on the wider side but i have such freakishly high arches that my shoe size (depending on the shoe) varies between 7.5 and 9.so when i saw the sizing options offered between 7.5 and 9 it was same old same old in terms of me being conflicted on what size to buy. especially after reading that these shoes "stretch out" or "loosen up" after being broken in.if a shoe is leather or will give and is offered in standard sizes I usually order a size 8 and if it's snug a few days of wearing them around with heavy layered socks seems to make them the perfect fit (i've even gone so far as to walk on my treadmill with 3 pairs of socks on to break a pair in...a bit nutty i know but it's what works!)when i ordered these it was after both reading tons of existing reviews and going through the questions/answers.honestly if these shoes were just for fashion i probably wouldve gone with the size 38 because any cute shoe should fit flush/snug. but keeping in mind that i'm on my feet all day (swelling etc) that it's cold most of the year and i'll be wearing much more substantial socks than the dippy little dollar-store throwaway ones i sport in the warmer months...i opted for the size 39.my foot slipped right in and they do clunk a bit when i walk but i absolutely made the right choice erring on the larger size for these shoes. i'd rather have a bit of give to accomodate warm socks (and the arch supports/inserts that inevitably find their way into any shoe i wear longer than once every few months) than have to worry about negotiating more room by stretching them out.so if you're around an 8 and dont know whether to go with 38 or 39 and you need these for being on your feet all day just in my personal opinion i'd say opt for the 39.also i ordered the black sparkle color and i was afraid they might look a bit more charcoal-y because of the glittery look but the color is definitely glossy black at first sight. just sparkly too. overall excellent buy!
