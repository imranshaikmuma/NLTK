I am very happy with this shirt. I bought a white one to wear under some lower cut tops that I wear in the winter. It provides warmth adds a little more color to my face which I like. I am on the short-waisted side and on me it is longish in the torso so that it shows on the bottom for a layered look which is something else like about it. I've washed it twice and it washed beautifully. It is super comfortable and has no tags to irritate or try to take off. I am thinking about buying more of them in different colors.
