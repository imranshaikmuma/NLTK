This itty-bitty camera is chock full of cool features and top notch quality! I have always used Canons and was actually looking to buy a Canon when I started playing around with the display Sony DSC-WX220 while waiting for the sales associate to return... I was instantly impressed!! I was just pointing and clicking not trying to hold steady and get a clear image just sort of goofing around.... But every image came out crisp and clear it was amazing!I decided to go ahead and buy this little camera (along with a Canon SX710 which is absolutely incredible!!). It has really fun features like "Gourmet food" mode and "pet" mode haha they are a little silly but seem to work! You can also select one color to stand out like red or green and everything else will be black and white... this was particularly cool when photographing my bright green lorikeet :)!Overall this camera has noticeably better image quality than many of the other digital cameras I have tried and owned. You can even edit pictures right then and there adjust brightness and contrast smooth out skin etc it's nuts!I would definitely go for it with this camera and make sure you get the gold because it's really nice and pristine looking :).
