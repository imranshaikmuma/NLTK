I love these converse so much. One of my favorite converse I have ever owned! They are easy to slip on and off. I can wear these all day being a hairstylist while doing clients. They don't hurt my feet and I love the fact I can dress them up with a cute dress or dress it down with something casual. Great shoes you cant go wrong!
