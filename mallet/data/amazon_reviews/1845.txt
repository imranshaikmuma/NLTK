I am SO DISAPPOINTED!! I have owned an Acer C720 for 3 years and loved it. The only reason why I was replacing it was to get a larger screen. Imagine my disappointment when the second one I received had the same problem the first one did it kept turning off and then on in the middle of my browsing! The first time I called Acer and after being "accidentally disconnected" after telling my problem the second time I was informed by the rep that my problem is that I bought it "sight unseen from Amazon"!!!!!!!!!! I told her that no the problem was that her computer didn't work! Furthermore I told her I had bought my last Acer computer from Amazon. Thankfully Amazon is great about returns. Now to look for another Chromebook from Amazon!
