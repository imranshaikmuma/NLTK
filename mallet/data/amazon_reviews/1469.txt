Fit:As others stated you never know which country these are going to come from and that does make a difference in fit. Got these for for my husband he normally wears a 38x32 but Dickies is notorious for cutting too long so we ordered these in a 38x30. They fit way to baggy but decided to wash before sending back. Surprisingly they did shrink up a bit after just one wash and fit much better. Even at a 30 in length they still are almost too long for him but they will work.Quality:Aside from the fit issues these pants are perfect. The double knee makes it easier to knell down and make the pants last longer. They are a nice heavy duty material that stand up to many different working conditions.Overall these are a great pant. Just make sure to understand the fit issues and don't just order your normal size. Also note these are "Loose Fit" and do look much baggier than the "regular fit". For my husband Dickies Men's Relaxed Straight Fit Double Knee Work Pant Dark Navy 38x30 had a much better looking fit.
