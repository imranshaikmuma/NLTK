We are in love with our new Apple MacBook Pro!  I bought this for my wife for Christmas and it has been everything we hoped for.  It is extremely fast and has amazingly quick data transfer speeds.  Once you get used to the new Touchbar it is an amazing addition to the Apple laptop line and is extremely useful.  We are looking forward to the future as more and more apps are updated to be used with the Touchbar.  The screen and sound are excellent; probably the best I've ever used.  The larger touchpad is a much welcomed addition and gives you plenty of workspace.  Overall we couldn't be happier!
