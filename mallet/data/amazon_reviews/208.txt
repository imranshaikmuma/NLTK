Ok...so I'm totally THAT dad.  First I opted for the Canon 60D...and although it was good...I felt it wasn't the best.  I also didn't care for the whole crop sensor issue as I felt that I had to leave the room just to take a picture of a group of people!  I was shooting with a 50 mm f/1.4 lens at the time.  Forget about taking pictures if there was any sort of space constraint.  So after a couple of months playing around with the 60D I upgraded to the 5D Mark III.All I can say is AWESOME!The quality of images shot through the roof.  I have several lenses that I use but the 50mm 1.4 and a 40 mm 2.8 are my favorites.  It's like the camera can take just the right picture in any sort of light!  Also added in the Speedline 430EX flash and now everything looks even better.If you can afford the higher priced Mark III and a decent lens...go for it.  It's worth it.  The other cameras are good too...but you may beg tired of the crop sensor issue.  I've uploaded some of my pictures if you are curious.  And like I said...yes I'm totally 'that dad.'OK...I lied.  I can't figure out how to add images.  It isn't exactly clear here on Amazon.  Perhaps I can write a review on that?  If there is a kind amazon helper that can assist me with this I'd really like to add some images. :)
