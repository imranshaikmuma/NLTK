I love these Peds. They feel great- soft yet sturdy. The gel pad keeps them in place all day. They are barely visible under my shoes. I recommend them and would definitely buy again- although they are so sturdy I might never need to!Update: I ordered these again since I liked them so much. Unfortunately although I just selected "buy again" I did not receive the same product. I should have realized there was a problem when I was told that this time they were coming from China. The packaging was different and so was the product. These gel pads are thinner and the Peds themselves are smaller and cut into my heels. I am not satisfied with this product switch. I would like to know how to get the original product again. I am disappointed in Amazon-a very rare thing. Thus I changed my rating from five to two stars.9/5 update. The "secret substitute" Peds are horrible. They shrank when washed and are painful to wear. I got no response from the supplier so I am down-rating them again. I won't order these ever again.
