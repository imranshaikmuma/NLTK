Whoever designed the keyboard is an idiot.  They placed the 'arrow up' key where the right shift key belongs.  For anyone who is accustomed to typing by touch this is a fatal flaw.  Every time I try to use the right shift key which is often I instead press the arrow up key with the result that I resume typing on the line above the line I was on.  Very frustrating!  It might be a good computer otherwise but this ridiculous change to the standard keyboard makes it unusable for me.
