I ordered 6 tank tops as pictured by Flowy Burnout Racerback Tank - M Fun Pack F2 and L Fun Pack F3.  The shirts I received are NOT the same shirts the Seller has pictured online on Amazon.  I received items with no print or grain in the tank top fabric at all.  They're solid colors.  I also received 2 grey tank tops and no white tank tops (I was supposed to get a blue green orange white grey and pink).  The blue green orange and pink tank tops are MUCH darker in color than the ones pictured.  The orange and pink colors are almost identical (it looks like I have 2 orange tanks).  Also they're fitted not "flowy" at all.  I am very very dissatisfied.
