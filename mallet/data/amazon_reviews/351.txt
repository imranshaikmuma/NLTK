I had a similar Sony camera that gave out after almost ten years of use.  I wanted something as similar as possible to my old one and this looked on paper to fit the bill.  However in ten years the quality has gone downhill.  This is more shoddily made and the picture quality was worse despite a higher pixel count. It's small and portable but the picture quality was very low (compared to the similar camera I had owned and other cameras produced today.) The shutter speed was awful so I was consistently frustrated taking pictures of family and friends--which is why I bought the camera!  If you really don't expect much it's ok but spending a little more--or as I did spending *LESS* on an older model--yielded much higher quality photos.
