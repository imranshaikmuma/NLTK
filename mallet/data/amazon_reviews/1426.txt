These are the only pair of jeans I wear. Not because they are the best but because they fit me really well. I'm 5-11 and pretty thin and the 34/34 are a go for me but they might be better if they came an inch or a half inch shorter. I like the different colors they come in I have some dark blue ones and some grey ones.
