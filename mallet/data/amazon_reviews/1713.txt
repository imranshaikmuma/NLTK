I love love this scrub top! Its comfortable moves with me and is a beautiful vibrant color (I purchased the turquoise color). It has pockets in all the right places with a little bungee on the back for hanging it up when I get home (nice touch). I've received tons of compliments and inquires as to where I purchased it.I also purchased the WonderWink Women's Wonderflex Faith Scrub Pant (Malibu blue) WonderWink Women's Wonderflex Faith Scrub Pant to go with this top since the WonderWink Four Stretch Pants in the same color were really really long; I'm 5'4" if that helps and they didn't have them in petite.If you are looking for comfort and style with vibrant color this top is the way to go!
