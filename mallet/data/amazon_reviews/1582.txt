You seeread and hear so much about knock offs beings sold as the real deal. I was very sceptical about purchasing this shirt since many complained about the fitting. When it arrived a day ahead of schedule and my husband tried it on I was relieved. I've purchase from cathartic website many times befor but we were going away on a whim and he needed a few new tee shirts. This is not too light weight nor too heavy it a medium weight shirt and fits just perfect. With the added benefit of a small percentage of synthetic fibers I don't antisapate any shrinkage. If I do I will update this review. My husband is a big man (and has lost weight recently which I'm very proud of him in succeeding ) not too tall in the bodice and this covers his belly very good. We love carhart products for their durability like another brand we use. Will purchase again.
