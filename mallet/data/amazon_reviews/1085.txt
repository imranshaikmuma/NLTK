I bought this petticoat to wear under the 1950s Vintage Rockabilly Swing Pleated Skirt and it was the best thing since sliced bread. Absolutely loved it created an awesome authentic rock-a-billy look. Makes the swing skirt nice and poofy. Only problem - there's no tag that indicates material or care instructions so I don't know whether to hand wash machine cold dry clean... All in all love it can't wait to wear it again.
