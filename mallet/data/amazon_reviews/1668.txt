I purchased this for my son who became a truck driver and needed a very warm coat when he traveled north. He is 6'3 and 300 lbs I ordered a 2X large tall first and it was too snug. I sent it back and got him a 3X large tall and it is perfect. Gave details for anyone needing to compare size. He said it is comfortable and very warm fits what he needed very well. Not easy to find a coat in that size and in tall. I had no problem at all returning/exchanging the coat. Amazon was very easy to work with. Received fast and in great condition. Update: My son and I got to visit so I asked him how his coat was holding up he said it still looked almost new. The best part was that it didn't rip if he got it caught on something didn't even snag the material. I hope that I have helped you make an informed decision on whether to buy this coat or not. If I have please let me know by hitting yes.
