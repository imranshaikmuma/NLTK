Love this shirt! Great price great colors great look! Not to thick was hoping woe a little more sweater-y material but can't complain! The skirt is quite long I'm about 5 foot 6 and 125 lbs. loosefitting and goes about half way between my hip and knee.  Great for wearing with leggings to cover my butt. If I was to buy it again I would consider ordering a small just because I'm thin and it seems like it should be more fitted bug I have SUPER long arms so I'd stick with the medium! Hope this helped and you enjoy this product as much as me!
