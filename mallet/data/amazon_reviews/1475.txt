I love these pants! They fit perfectly. The bottoms are a little bit more bell than I would like but overall they fit great. When I'm standing you can't see the laces on my boots. The side pocket on the right leg is far enough above the right knee to put your cell phone in. And not just any cell phone; I put a 5.7 inch cell phone in the pocket and it slid in smoothly. It was also no trouble to get it out. The front pockets are of ample size and nicely positioned. They also rest nice and flat when your standing upright.  The only complaints I can muster are the belt loops barely fit an inch and a half belt there are two Dickies labels stitched to the outside; one on the cell pocket and one on the left knee (I don't advertise for free) and there is some pilling on the front of the thighs after a few wears.  I'd recommend these to a friend and I will buy these again soon.
