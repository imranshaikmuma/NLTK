They may shrink some and I would prefer "somewhat large versus somewhat small.  After one washing they are still a bit stiff but I fully expect them to soften up after multiple washings.  Washed them in cold water and there was absolutely no bleeding or running.  This is good.  I did fold one up and put it in my pocket.  It is a bit bulkier than a normal sized handkerchief but again I will have to give this a further use trial before making a final decision on size.  When they soften up they should compress into a smaller size.  I may also end up using it as a headband during times of high perspiration so that is another plus.  80% of people are optimists and I fall into that group.....luckily for me.
