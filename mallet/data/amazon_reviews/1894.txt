I really love this product. The more I use and the more I discover that it is well beyond my expectations.It is good  to perform all kind of actions  however I am aware that it is not a gaming computer and probably will not perform well for games. But it is more than enough to use for  daily uses such as  mailing/reading/browsing audio listening and of course very fast video streaming which is all I needed .I have noticed that amazon has increased its price by 65 us within a week probably after a high demand ? I have increased its Ram to 12 GB which was a very easy job even for non computer  handy person. Now I can easily run a lot of  applications at the same time without any slow down on performance.I highly recommend this product for similar uses.
