This is a lovely top. Every time I ware it people tell me how much they like it and the color. I ordered the purple dip dye. I am tall about 5' 9" weight around 135lbs and small chested so I ordered the medium.  It fits well on me because I do have hips. It does not have sleeves.  More like a wide tank top or cap sleeves. Would definitely buy again.
