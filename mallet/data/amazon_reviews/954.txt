Much has already been shared about pros and cons so I won't elaborate too much here.  I'm more of a "casual" user and keep phones for 2+ years.  I mostly email text surf make calls check weather use maps use Google apps take pics and occasionally play a game.  The Mate 9 has aligned with all my expectations (thus far) having never been a Huawei customer.  I Iove the fingerprint scanner love the screen (especially how bright it can get outside) love the 2-3 days I can get between battery charges (YMMV) love the feel in hand love the camera love the 64 gb storage and storage upgrade with memory card option love the call clarity/loudness (speakerphone included) and love the reception (more ATT bars at my house & work than previous Moto X 2014 Pure Edition).  I also like EMUI coming from the Moto X Pure.  I'm hoping for a car charger from Huawei in the near future.  Overall it seems this phone will do me fine for the next 2+ years.
