In the beginning it took a while to get used to the heavy weight and crisp screen but this laptop is worth it for the price and the features it provides. It has a good design and strong metallic structure. Some cons were with the screen blacking out after being sleep which was fixed by factory resetting and the bloatware which takes a while to remove. I would recommend this laptop for anyone to buy.
