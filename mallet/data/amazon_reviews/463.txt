Very very disappointed in this camera. The LCD screen broke the second time it was used. Construction is very flimsy... It just feels cheap to hold. The retractable lens cover rattles doesn't close completely and is very loose. Picture quality was okay. I expected better from Canon. I sent it to Canon for repairs which they said they won't do on this model. I had to pay to ship it to them for a replacement camera (albeit at a reduced price) and to have it shipped back to me.
