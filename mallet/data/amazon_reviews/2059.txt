Couldn't be happier with this Chromebook.  I am a heavy Apple user but was eyeing a Chromebook for months as a lighter power-friendly alternative for both travel and bouncing around the office.  After doing a ridiculous amount of research I was expectantly awaiting the release of this model due to it's light weight and quoted 13 hours of battery life.  Now that it has arrived I'm happy to say that it has completely lived up to expectations on both fronts.  It is super light and lasts forever.  The build quality is also really solid for a sub $200 device.The keyboard and trackpad were both a great surprise.  I was initially unsure about typing for long hours on the c201's keyboard but within a few hours I was typing rapidly accurately and comfortably.  The trackpad is also a star.  It's comfortable and fluid and works about as well as the one on my Macbook Pro.  Overall both the keyboard and trackpad make the device a pleasure to use.I'm not a Linux user which is why I was comfortable going with a non-Intel chip but I hear if that's what you're after this may not be the processor for you.  I can say that with the 4gb version it has kept up to every task I've thrown at it so far (Netflix youtube tons of Google docs and browser based screenwriting apps).  In my opinion if you need much more you probably shouldn't be looking at a Chromebook anyway.  But if you're comfortable with the always-online nature of Chrome OS than this chromebook definitely has you covered in terms of performance.I could easily see this becoming the go-to device in the house getting more use than both my Macbook Pro and my iPad.
