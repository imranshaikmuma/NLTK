I'm 5'6" and weigh 200 pounds. The 3x are a little baggy on me (saw the other reviews that said to go in higher sizes if you're unsure) but are super comfy and I can tie up the waist so it's not a huge deal. My roommate is 235 pounds 5'7" and they fit her very well also. When it says they're tall they MEAN tall. The inseam is a good 32-33 inches so if you don't have the height in the legs be prepared.
