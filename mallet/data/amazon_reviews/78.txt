Haven't used much yet because I need to micro adjust my lenses and haven't had time.  But I can say this far outranks my 7D for use in low light.  Very little grain when I used at 1600 ISO in low light.  I couldn't do that with my 7D or I would have to adjust the luminace to the point that nothing was sharp no matter what lenses I was using.  Also the CA seems less with this camera than with the 7D - I tried both with the same lens on a tripod at the same distance and focal length and the CA that the lens causes didn't seem as prominent with the 80D.  I think I am going to absolutely LOVE this camera!
