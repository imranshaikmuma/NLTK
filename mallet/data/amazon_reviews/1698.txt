Great service in receiving my lab coat promptly. I have as yet to try it at school. It feels a bit small. I think I should have gotten the X-large  instead of the Large? I'll see how it fits under normal working conditions next week in the lab and decide then. I am not accounting for any shrinkage when washed? Anyway I'll see and report back.Morad
