I love it! I've been looking for new shirts to replace some old ones. These are exactly what I wanted.  Very flattering tighter around the arms loose around the middle.  I've bought about 20 of them and plan to wear them every day.  They've replaced half of my wardrobe.  The material is excellent.  It's super soft and I found the mint light grey purple ombre and  lavender to not be see through at all. The light pink was see through so I sent it back.  I washed one in the washer on cold and then dried it.  It came out okay but with a little pilling. I also washed an identical one on cold and then hung to dry. It dried very soft without the pilling. So I plan to hang to dry to keep them looking as nice as possible so I can wear them for the next 10 years but if I dry them it won't be a big deal. They look extra great paired with the Trendy United long skirts.  They are true to size so I bought half large and half XL. If you go up to the larger size it will be less tight and more blousy but both sizes fit me.
