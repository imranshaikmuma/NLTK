This was my first DSLR camera and I love it so far.  I purchased it about 3 weeks ago before a vacation to Dubai and my pictures were amazing.  After only a few weeks I still do not know how to use all the features but I'm learning.  The camera itself is very user friendly with many automatic settings and pre-set settings.  The size is also nice not to heavy to carry around all day and fit nicely in my crossbody purse.  Overall I am very happy with it.
