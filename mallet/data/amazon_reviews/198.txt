It had been a long time since I had time for photography and I was not sure I really needed a DSLR when there are so many decent point and shoot systems out there.  But I am really glad I took the chance on this camera.  I had forgotten how much I loved photography and how good I actually was.  This camera challenges me to make critical decisions about my photography and gives me the tools to execute on the decisions I make.  I jumped right back in and am shooting almost entirely on manual mode and the quality of my shots is outstanding (most of the time ;-).  I am trying to give the Program modes a shot at making some of the decisions for me - especially when I am not in a thinking mood and just want to shoot like a P&S and they do a great job. I'll never make money off my photography but I have quickly become the defacto photographer for every family event and it is always with me on my hikes and travels and has all the settings I need to switch from street to landscape to portraiture depending on where I am at any given moment.  I have a long way to go before I master all the intricacies but this system has reawakened a passion in me and makes me feel like a kid again exploring a talent that I had let go completely dormant.  If you can commit some time to practice and want the flexibility and power that a DSLR can give you the D7200 is a great camera for prosumers and has a decent selection of DX lenses.  It would be nice if Nikon would invest in super wide DX lenses the way they do for FX but off brand manufacturers are filling the space nicely.  Unless you need massive enlargements I doubt you will ever miss the full format system.
