The laptop arrived quickly but right out of the box the laptop came with either a buggy or obsolete mouse (pointer) Synaptics device driver a couple of calls to the Lenovo support team and an updated device driver fixed the problem.I've only had this laptop for a few days but here are my first observations:PROS:Great modern designFast processingLight weightDecent battery lifeCONS:The small right "Shift" key takes some getting used to.I'm a first time Lenovo users after using HP and Toshiba laptops for many year.***************************************************So after 2 short weeks the laptop will not re-charge not sure if the problem is with the the power cord or the laptop itself. I'm totally disappointed to say the least I will try to contact Lenovo but if I don't get a quick resolution I will be returning the laptop. I'm also lowering the rating to 1 star for now.Update - After contacting Lenovo online and speaking to a support person over the phone they rushed me a new power cord which arrived in 3 days. The moment I replaced the old power cord with the new one the laptop started recharging once again which was a relief because I had already loaded a ton of software in the machine and didn't want to return the laptop let's hope this is the last issue I have to deal with.
