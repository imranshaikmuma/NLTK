The package we recv'd only had 4 pairs in it.  We expected this difference from the original order because the supplier sent a very nice email expIaning the problem and refunded the difference to us.I have to say my relatives don't send such nice emails nor can I remember receiving such a courteous and sincere apology for a mistake.The fit was as expected.  The material very soft and smooth after just one washing.  Hubby reports legs do not ride up and gather uncomfortably.  Tagless saves me the trouble of teasing the tag and all the little threads out.  He luuuuuvs the covered waistband.Worked all day up and down ladders taking down Christmas decos; bending twisting extended reaching -  stayed cool and comfy.Hubby is 6'3" 330#.  Wears the 3X  regular not 3XT.  Fit great!
