These green Superfeet are made for those with high arches. They make different colors for different types of support based on the curvature of your arches. I originally got a pair from Road Runner Sports where you can get fitted for shoes based on your step. They have you walk on a treadmill with cameras on your step to tell what type of shoe support you need...At the time I was training for a marathon and didn't have the funds for high end orthotics. Based on my chiropractors' recommendation to stay away from any that are very flexible these seemed like a good supportive set.These are not cozy or comfortable in fact they feel almost rock hard. However they are extremely supportive and hand washable. I have sets I've owned through marathons I've ran as well as 60 mile walks. These things don't break down after hundreds of miles and years of use.I bought this set as a gift for my brother who has Plantar Fasciitis. Sizing is accurate and you cut them down around the toes as instructed (if needed). Excellent product and I'm constantly recommending them to others.They work best in shoes you've removed the insoles in but are okay without doing so in most. In some they'd make it a bit too tight without removing the original insoles but every shoe differs.These are not for high heels but they do make a black set I own and would also recommend that is made for high heels. For around $40 I think these green Superfeet are a godsend for anyone who can't stand flats because they need high arch support. Highly recommended. Smile. Hope this is helpful!
