I loved the idea of having a smart watch. I've been looking for one for a while and i wasn't willing to pay $500 for the Samsung Gear. It didn't come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation/ use/ set up. Of course is touch screen. It took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens. When you want to dial out the numbers aren't all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times. The volume is kind of low. I wish it was louder (so when driving i could hear the person clearer) however I've been told that i can be heard just fine. Playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone. It does not have a camera you can't verbally write your text messages and i still haven't completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book. All in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price. Play around with the watch for awhile you'll eventually love it. The inside of the band is completely Rubber and I don't sweat which is good. It looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures
