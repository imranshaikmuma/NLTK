If my job as a nurse allowed me to stand still with no walking or bending over these would be fine.  Wearing the XL the pants are too snug in the thighs and make bending or squatting uncomfortable.  I tried the 2XL and they were way too large below the waistband with the crotch half way down my thighs.  With the XL the crotch still droops after moving around and I'm constantly needing to hitch up the waist of the pants- even though when bending etc. they feel too tight.  The material is lightweight but still stiff after 4-5 washings and it doesn't breathe at all adding hot to the overall discomfort level.  I've given up on these and ordered something else.  The price is great but the comfort level and fit is awful.
