I love the style and firmness of this shoe/sneaker. At first I could only wear them for short periods being new. As I wear them more they are getting easier on my feet. I have degenerative disk disease and flat feet so I can't wear certain shoes. I need something that is firm with a thick sole and this shoe is it. Although it looks big and heavy it is not. It still has a lightness that is easy for me and doesn't tire me out with all the walking I have to do.There is also enough room for my arch supports no cramming.Another positive my toes and feet don't get cramps wearing these as with some other styles.I would like to get this in other colors as well. That's how much I like this style.
