Haven't noticed a whole lot of "waist training" mainly because I am already an hour glass shape. I bought this more for back support because of how it's designed and the reviews. It works great the only problem is that it seems made for women with very long torsos and small boobs. I am 5'10 consider myself a tall woman there's nothing short about me and I will never be described as 'petite' but this thing covered from my hips all the way way up under my breasts.This would have been good but the front and back are almost the same length. If the back went up that high but the front dipped down more it would have been perfect. I gave it 4 stars because the top without some serious adjustment (and I wear super expensive supportive bras because I'm a 40F cup) was right under my boobs and almost covering them which is not entirely comfortable. The other reason I gave 4 stars was that the colors are not as appear I know there are variations because of screen resolutions blah blah blah but the purple is straight up pink and the pink is hot pink there really isn't a 'purple'.
