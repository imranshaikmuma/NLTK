Great little camera. The widescreen shooting option is great it lets you capture more. The panoramic mode offers great shots and underwater shots are really clear. The selfie mode took a while to get use to but went on a trip recently and used it quit a bit and the extra wide screen helps capture more in the background. Indoor shots are average at best. One note don't leave the battery compartment door open for long periods. Humidity can get into the camera that way and cause fogging in the lens compartment. I learned that the hard way and used a hairdryer to get it dried out!
