BlutekUSA I am very disappointed.  BlutekUSA sent me a refurbished device. I am not happy. It came in the OEM box but didn't have any AT&T  branding or specs outside. There is a crease at the bottom left corner of the screen. It seems as though the screen has been replaced. Whenever the touch keys are illuminated  light is emitted from the crease. Got this unit at $329. Thought it was a deal but it was robbery. I demand a refund!
