I am an older RN with a bit of a belly. I am 5' 10" tall and 170# with a 32-33" inseam. I buy the large tall.I love these pants!  Why?  Because they actually de_emphasize my waist as they are a mId_rise give my butt a little definition due to the rear flap pockets and have a straight leg... no flare which I prefer. Like your favorite pair of jeans these only get softer over time. They are sturdy...i still wear pairs that I have had for more than six years. Plus they have plenty of pockets for my gear.Complaints?  The bungee on the bottom can be a bit annoying as it will scrape the floor depending on the shoe I wear.  Also I always tuck the outer waist tie into my pants to avoid that extra waist bulge. I also like the Koi Morgan style pant...it has a wider straight leg and an inside tie.
