I waited for a while before writing a review about this product. The reason for that is because I wanted to have a good chance to use the laptop for some time and experience its functions closely. After a couple of months of using this product I finally could say that it's the best thing that I have ever bought up to this moment. The laptop works great and the package was delivered on time. Regardless to the fact that the outside box was damaged the inside box was fine.  I use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it's just great. Therefore my advice to you if you're a student and you need a laptop for school this laptop is the best choice for you. And if you're concerned about the system I would tell you that as a person who has never used a MacBook before actually buying it do not worry you will get used to it in no time as I did.
