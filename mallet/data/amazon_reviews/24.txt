I bought this camera knowing it is an entry level camera. I was tired of the photo quality I was getting off of my Galaxy S5 and this camera went on sale on Black Friday for $450 with an additional lens bundle. It takes great photos for what I use it for. I use it to take photos outside and it does a great job even on just automatic settings. I have still not had the time to sit and read through the instruction manual and watch videos online. I can only imagine what it is capable of once I learn all the ins and outs of the manual settings.
