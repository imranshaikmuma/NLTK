This is a great shirt! It's a nice soft fabric that is light but not thin and clingy. It's the perfect length for leggings. I'm 5'2" and at the longest the band goes right under my butt. I usually wear an XL shirt or 14/16 because of my bust size (34FF) and I bought the XXXL. I could go down a size but it's nice and flowy and I like how it doesn't cling.The best part is the armholes are nice and high. Usually shirts that are big enough around my bust have huge armholes but this shirt doesn't. It keeps it from looking sloppy even though it's nice and roomy.It comes in a bunch of colors so I'm definitely buying more.
