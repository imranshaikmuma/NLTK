By now you know all the reasons why this is a fabulous camera.  But it has a design defect.  On some models (one I purchased and two I subsequently heard about) the lens cover sometimes does not fully retract when the camera powers up.  You don't know this happened unless you look very closely at the image on the screen.  This ruined several of my recent vacation photos.  I'm returning the camera I bought for a replacement in hopes of getting one without the defect.
