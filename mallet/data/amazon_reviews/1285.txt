I am 5'3 150 lbs (8 months pregnant) and ordered the medium. These would be perfect if they were not sooo long! Also I agree with another reviewer that these may be junior sizing because the medium fits tight at the waist and thighs and def would not fit over my pregnant belly. Can't imagine how long the large would be on me lol. Good for the price if you are taller. Would be worth spending a few bucks to have them hemmed.
