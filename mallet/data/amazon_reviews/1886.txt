This laptop at first was slow and almost immediately had an updateI wanted the 64 cause of windows anything less is a crawl and unable to do any updates making smaller memory laptops obsolete even if newIf you do not need windows go for a chromebook I bought this because my husband has a chromebook and they will not print to a bluetooth printerThere is no cd drive but you can get a portable one usb for $25 so I got the computer I could afford that was the most functinal for me.The computer is a bit smaller than a regular laptop in keyboard and monitor more suited to a lady or a childDo not buy a dell tey were my favorite until they wanted more money to fix something that should have been under 7 month warranty than it cost me to buy this laptop. I also decided against buying warranty for this laptop for this reason because companies will not honor it. (also happened with lenovo despite extended warranty that was purchased)
