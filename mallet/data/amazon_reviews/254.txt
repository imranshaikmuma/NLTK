Great camera for the price I got it at (Black Friday sale).  I have a D70s that it is replacing because I wanted the CMOS sensor for the much less grainy pics.  I do miss the extra dial on front.  The screen is close to 3x as large as the D70s.  24 MPs is nice when you need to crop compared to 6 MO of the D70s.The camera feels like a toy when you lift them side by side.  The D70s has a metal frame while I think the D3300 has a carbon fiber frame.  I've since gotten use to the lightweight feel of the camera and enjoy it.  When you put a long lens on it it feels very front heavy though.  Even though this is a consumer camera compared to a nearly pro of my recent camera the pictures it takes are quite a bit better.  The metering is far nicer then the D70sI'd recommend this to anyone.
