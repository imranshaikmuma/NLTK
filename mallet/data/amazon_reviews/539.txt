This is a solid performer. It's real strengths are not so much on land but underwater. Shore performance is acceptable but there are much better options if you are looking for a land only point and shoot. I used it over three months as my dive camera. It fits nicely in the pocket of a BCD. The quality of the images particularly macro is very good for the price range. It is important to learn how to set the white balance by evaluating something white like a dive slate every 3 to 4 meters to get accurate colors. Following this advice the quality of the shots can be extremely high. Warning: If you compare your images to a G16 with housing or similar...you will see a difference. This camera can not do much higher priced options can do but if you are a casual photographer then it will do the trick. It is much better than a GoPro in my experience.A few words on the depth ratings. The camera works fine up to 25m depths. Beyond this at about 28m it becomes unresponsive as it should. I took the camera to 30+ meters on many occasions sometimes it just stayed in my BCD pocket and other times I attempted to test it. It would power up but just display a countdown timer and was non functional. No surpise here. When I returned to 25m is worked perfectly again on the same dive. So this is a real bonus. I even took to to 42.5 m on on dive and it continued to work fine once I returned to 25m and also on shore. It is a great deal at 300 bucks and a solid performer. Plus it is so nice to have a camera that you can stash away and use or not use on a dive without the hassle of carrying around a bunch of excess gear to look after. For people who dive and wnat to take a few images and HD videos along the way = yes. Professionals who truly want professional quality images from their dives.....move up into the $1000 plus price range.
