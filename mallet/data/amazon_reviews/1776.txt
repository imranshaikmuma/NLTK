These are super comfortable! They're thicker than other Hanes socks I've bought before so they're perfect for when it gets colder but you don't want to wear taller/longer socks. I've bought two packs and so far they're washing well and are durable.The cut is perfect too and for me they're below my ankle which means for most of my shoes they don't show (they show just a slight on Chuck Taylor/Converse but compared to most 'No Show' socks these are the closest to actually not showing; except if you're comparing to shoe liners/boat shoe socks or those new types of no show socks with a new cut that covers half your foot (by Converse Vans etc) which are good too but usually are expensive)
