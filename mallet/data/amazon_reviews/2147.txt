The battery life only stretches to around 3 hours and 30 minutes at best and the cpu speed is 2.2 ghz not 2.9 cuts off when i pick it up sometime it may have a loose wire... maybe not the distributes fault and is fixable on my end but is an inconvenience. I got the glossy finish and it is a finger print magnet... some game are rough to give the truth usually i have to put it on low settings...all put aside i really like the price... although the keyboard is a bit out of my liking with little plunge and poppy sound it is usable... but remember your not buying a 1500 dollar pc its a laptop gamer from dell so u get what u pay for... but is good at opening many pages and does not slow down... the resolution looks great... and is easy to use.. windows 10 runs well and gives easy access... i would recommend getting firefox or chrome because internet explorer is not fast...Drives many games well and gets great airflow even when blocked or not well ventilated... this is a great computer for the price and well worth the money.P.S.-camera is also good and gives great pictures and video.
