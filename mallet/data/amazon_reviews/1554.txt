Great scrub top. Love all the pockets too. I typically wear a small in scrub tops. I'm 5'6" 130 lbs but found this small to be a little too big. I've ordered an x-small and still waiting for it to come in. I'm waiting on urbane knit top pants to come in too. I will update review once the new stuff arrives. This is still a 5 star item. Just think I need a smaller sizeX-small fits perfect! And the urbane knit waist pants are great too. This is my new favorite brand and will only buy these for now on. I got x-small in pants and they fit perfect.
