After 4 days of continuous use  I really like this phone.  You get a great amount of storage  a good quality screen and performance.  I  am by no means a hardcore  mobile phone gamer.  The most taxing game I play is Fallout Shelter and The Wolf Among Us and this phone loads and plays them without a hitch.  The rest includes streaming music and playing it over Bluetooth at home or in the car  watching YouTube Amazon and Netflix videos. Of course I also talk on the phone and use turn by turn navigation often.  No problems with call quality ringer and speaker volume or with wifi or cellular connections or stability.  Over the past 3 years this is my 4th mobile.  I also currently own a Motorola Moto X Style Pure edition 2015.  It's in the pics for a size comparison.  The Moto X ran me $500 last year and the Moto G4 Plus set me back $325 after some customization at Moto maker.  I like the G4 Plus almost as much as the Moto X  but the X wins on style (G4 is really plain looking) and screen quality.  However for $175 less  the G4 is a great value.  Nice rapid charging too.  More to come in a few weeks. Enjoy the pics.
