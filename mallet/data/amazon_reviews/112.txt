Just used this for the first time this weekend and it worked very well!  Perfect for keeping my camera stable and safe while I ride my bike.  (I keep the camera strap around my neck as well).  The "post" did unscrew itself from the tripod mount which was my fault as I didn't tighten it enough... but much to my relief I found it sitting safe and sound locked in the "holster".  Great design... so glad I got this!
