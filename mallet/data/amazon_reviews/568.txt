I have ordered Alot of things from Amazon and i Really never had a problem with ANY of the products i have Ordered until i Purchased this Camera For 1 the Batteries are Somewhat Difficult to put in. You have to turn the camera upside down to get to the battery compartment then there is a very tiny button that you have to slide upwards and at the same time try to slide the battery cover to the right Finally after several attempts i was able to get the compartment open. And it is not easy to figure out how to use some of the functions either. If you use the Flash it has to charge first meanwhile Draining your batteries very fast. I had brand new batteries in it and i wanted to use the Flash and by the time the Flash charged Without taking a picture my batteries were already half way Drained. And it will not work without first Purchasing a Micro SD card and Inserting it which by the way is not too easy when i was able to get the Micro SD card in it i kept getting a Card Error on the screen. I will be Sending this camera back and Requesting a Refund. I offer my HONEST opinion about things i Purchase and i will continue doing it.
