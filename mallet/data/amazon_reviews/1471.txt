I ordered the 100% cotton version of this. According to the description above that was the fabric. I detest polyester. However what arrived was in fact 65% polyester and only 35% cotton. I was forced to return it for a refund since neither the automated return function nor actual real human customer service reps were able or willing to address the basic issue of either sending an all cotton version as a replacement or determining whether such as thing even exists. Typical Amazonian support nightmare dance of mis-direction and really well-educated non-native English speakers not understanding a simple issue.  As it turns out a search of the Dickies site turns up no all-cotton garments except for the carpenter pants. Amazon certainly wasted a lot of my time and energy for absolutely nothing.That said I should warn other potential buyers of the actual polyester/cotton pant that it is so undersized that it comes close to being fraud. I wear a 32-34" waist depending. The pants I received were allegedly 34" but had to be at least 2 inches too small. I'd have needed to lose a dangerous amount of weight to get them to fit. If you've never purchased Dickies before ( as was true for me) I'd recommend trying on the pants at Walmart or some place similar before ordering them from Amazon.
