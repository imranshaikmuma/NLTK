I have mixed feelings about this camera. The picture quality is pretty good for the most part but not having enough manual control over the actual picture taking is a bit frustrating. I am not asking for SLR type of manual control but enough to get a good shot in many different lighting conditions. I find myself having to constantly override that automatic flash settings to ensure I don't get washed out pictures which are too bright because the flash wants to overcompensate for semi-lit conditions. My iPhone 6 plus handles low light situations superbly without a flash. Then when the flash is necessary it is not a blinding white flash that makes people know there was a flash used but a dual warm color flash that makes pictures look like they have natural lighting. The point of a flash is to compensate for low light not to overpower the low light and essentially be a light replacement. I am also quite disappointed with one major flaw that makes recording videos almost not realistic. The video recording resolution and optical image stabilization are fantastic. But again there is a downside. The motor that is used for auto-focusing is ridiculously noisy. So when you record a video with a moving subject which is kind of the norm you can hear the constant and agonizing sound of the motor running in the background. The only way to avoid this is to have a subject that pretty much does not move. This would totally defeat the purpose of taking a video. In conclusion this camera is a good one with good picture quality but it has its few downfalls that make it less appealing than the cameras that are on most mid-to-high-end phones. This camera is much better suited to outdoor conditions with plenty of natural light. Once it starts to get dark outside then the flash makes taking "natural" looking pictures very difficult.
