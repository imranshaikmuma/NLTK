I have only had these boots for a couple of weeks but in that time the state was hit with a blizzard and we got more than 2' of snow overnight. These boots stayed warm and dry the entire time I was outside despite the snow being as deep as they are tall. They truly are waterproof and seem to be holding up nicely. They look nice aren't too bulky to be fashionable and are really comfortable. They don't feel too clunky to wear as street shoes after you shovel snow.
