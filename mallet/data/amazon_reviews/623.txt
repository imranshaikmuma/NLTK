This camera is versatile and reasonably easy to handle. It took me a while to get it adjusted for taking movies into the light as automatic features may underexpose the shadows and sometimes focus on the vegetation behind the backlit subject/animal. The minimum focus distance varies as you move to higher zoom magnification and occasionally caused a shot to be missed or discarded as a small bird moved close to me. This may be overcome with the continuous focus setting (which doesn't always stay with the subject). These are not problems with this camera but rather with using superzooms in general on smaller wildlife. After a month in Africa I should have a better idea how well the stabilizing system works out the window of a hot running vehicle! I have no doubt that all fixed (non-video) shots will be fine.
