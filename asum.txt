-->assumption of lda in topic modeling:
it assumes that every document in the corpus is made up of one or more topics (multiple) with their probability distributions over those topics.

-->lda is a generative process



-->ASPECT SENTIMENT UNIFICATION MODEL:
it is built to uncover relationship between sentiments and aspects
here we discover aspects and discover words in them that express sentiments

assumption in ASUM is one sentence describes one aspects

assumption in ASUM vs assumption in LDA:
each sentence represent one aspect in ASUM---this is done to capture locality of word and in general words together has different meaning than taken separately
each word represent one topic in LDA



topic modeling libraries in python:
genism, graphlab, lda and scikit learn
